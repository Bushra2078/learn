## Contribute to our learning content
We welcome contributions from our community as well as from Microsoft employees from outside the documentation teams. How you contribute depends on who you are and the sort of changes you'd like to contribute:

* **Employees - minor updates**: If you are contributing minor updates out of the goodness of your heart, you can fork the repository and submit updates from your fork. See our [Docs contributor guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/) for more information.

* **Employees - new content + major changes**: If you're part of the Azure community and you want to create a new module or submit major changes, please submit an issue to start a conversation with the APEX Learning team. Once you've agreed to a plan, you'll need to work with an APEX Learning employee to help bring that content in. For more information about Microsoft Learn, review our [APEX Learning Docs](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/?branch).

## Repository organization
The content in the learn repository is unique compared to traditional Docs. Learning modules are made up of YAML and MD files. For more information about how to understand the content files, view our [Create a module](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/create-a-module?branch=master#implementation) documentation.
