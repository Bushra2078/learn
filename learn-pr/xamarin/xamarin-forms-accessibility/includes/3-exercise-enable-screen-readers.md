## Enable Windows screen reader

Narrator is a screen reader built directly into Windows to enable users to use their PC without a mouse to complete common tasks. You can enable Narrator in the following ways:

(On older versions of Windows, the command was the **Windows logo key** + **Enter**.) On many keyboards, the Windows logo key is located on the bottom row of keys, to the left or right of the Alt key.

- Press the **Windows logo key** + **Ctrl** + **N** to open Narrator settings, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.
