## Windows screen reader

Narrator is built directly into Windows to enable users to user their PC without a mouse to complete common tasks by reading and interacting with things on the screen like text and buttons. You can enable Narrator in the following ways:

- Press the **Windows logo key** + **Ctrl** + **Enter** together to start Narrator. Press these keys again to stop Narrator. (On older versions of Windows, the command was the **Windows logo key** + **Enter**.) On many keyboards, the Windows logo key is located on the bottom row of keys, to the left or right of the Alt key.

- Press the **Windows logo key** + **Ctrl** + **N** to open Narrator settings, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.
