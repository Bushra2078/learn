By using Xamarin.Forms automation properties, app developers can improve accessibility of their apps in several ways. Automation properties provide access to the underlying native platforms accessibility features. These properties to give better control over screen readers and navigation assistance tools, which is one of the most important parts of building accessible mobile apps.

Suppose you've been hired to build an app by using Xamarin.Forms. The specifications for the app were already created by a graphic designer. They include some elements that don't automatically provide hints for screen readers, such as images and entries. To ensure that our app is accessible to every user, we will extend these controls with accessibility features that Xamarin.Forms provides.
