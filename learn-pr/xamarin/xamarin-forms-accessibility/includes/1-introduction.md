By using Xamarin.Forms automation properties, app developers can improve the accessibility of their apps in several ways. Automation properties provide access to the accessibility features of underlying native platforms. These properties give developers better control over screen readers and navigation assistance tools, which are crucial to support in building accessible mobile apps.

## Example scenario

Suppose you've been hired to build an app by using Xamarin.Forms. A graphic designer already created the specifications for the app. These specifications include elements that don't automatically provide hints for screen readers, such as images and entries. To ensure that the app is accessible to every user, you'll extend these controls with accessibility features that Xamarin.Forms provides.

## What will you be doing?

In this module, you'll first enable your system's screen reader and navigation assistance tools so you can get a feel for how they work. Then, you'll create a new Xamarin application and add automation properties and meaningful content ordering to improve its accessibility. 

You'll be able to use your screen reader to hear the speech that the automation properties generate. You'll also be able to intelligently move through your app's controls by using touch gestures on the touchscreen or by using a keyboard.

## What's the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to add text to speech screen reader features and control the order in which the on-screen elements are read. The goal is to improve the accessibility of your Xamarin.Forms mobile application.
