Accessibility refers to the concept of designing app user interfaces that work well operating system display- and input-assistance features such as large type, high contrast, zoom in, screen reading (text-to-speech), visual or haptic feedback cues, and alternative input methods.

There are many APIs that desktop and mobile platforms like iOS, Android, and Windows provide to enable developers to build more accessible apps. In this module we will specifically focus on optimizing our app to work better with screen readers that provide text-to-speech for user interface controls. Additionally, we will explore how specifying tab order of controls can improve usability and accessibility for users.


## How do screen readers work?

Each platform has it's own version of a screen reader that gives auditory descriptions of user controls that are displayed on the screen. These descriptors help users navigate through the application and give reference to controls that have no input or written text such as images. Screen readers are often controls through gestures on the touchscreen, with a trackpad, or a keyboard. 


## Android screen reader

TalkBack is a feature of Android that provides screen reader capabilities. It is included on most devices or can be downloaded directly from the Google Play app store. To enable TalkBack on your device follow these instructions:

- Open the **Settings** app on your Android device
- Navigate or search for **Accessibility**
- Select **TalkBack** from the screen readers section
- Turn on and off TalkBack by toggling the **User service** setting
- A confirmation dialog will appear, select **Allow** to enable TalkBack control

It is recommended to go through the TalkBack tutorial, which will launch automatically the first time you turn on TalkBack.

## iOS screen reader

VoiceOver is Apple's screen reader technology that is availble across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other Apple devices. On select devices it also supports braille through a connected braille display. To enable VoiceOver on your device follow these instructions:

- Open the **Settings** app on your iOS device
- Navigate or search for **Accessibility**
- Select **VoiceOver** from the **Vision** section
- Turn on and off VoiceOver by toggling service on and off.
- A confirmation dialog will appear, select **OK** to enable VoiceOver.

It is recommended to go through the VoiceOver tutorial, which can be found by selecting **VoiceOver Practice** in the VoiceOver section.

## Windows screen reader

Narrator is built directly into Windows to enable users to user their PC without a mouse to complete common tasks by reading and interacting with things on the screen like text and buttons. You can enable Narrator in the following ways:

- Press the **Windows logo key** + **Ctrl** + **Enter** together to start Narrator. Press these keys again to stop Narrator. (On older versions of Windows, the command was the **Windows logo key** + **Enter**.) On many keyboards, the Windows logo key is located on the bottom row of keys, to the left or right of the Alt key.

- Press the **Windows logo key** + **Ctrl** + **N** to open Narrator settings, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.

It is recommended to go through the Narrator tutorial, which can be foun din the Narrator settings creen.
