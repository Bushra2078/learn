Accessibility refers to the concept of designing app user interfaces that work well with operating system features for display-assistance and input-assistance. These features include large type, high contrast, zoom in, screen reading (text-to-speech), visual or haptic feedback cues, and alternative input methods.

There are many APIs that desktop and mobile platforms like iOS, Android, and Windows provide to enable developers to build more accessible apps. In this module, we will specifically focus on optimizing our app to work better with screen readers that provide text-to-speech for user interface controls. Additionally, we will explore how specifying tab order of controls can improve usability and accessibility for users.

## How do screen readers work?

Each platform has its own version of a screen reader. They give auditory descriptions of user controls that are displayed on the screen. These descriptors help users navigate through the application and give reference to controls that have no input or written text such as images. Screen readers are often controlled through gestures on the touchscreen, with a trackpad, or a keyboard. 

Next, you will learn what each operating system offers for screen readers and how to enable them.
