Storing data locally on a mobile device can be useful for improving performance. Instead of constantly making calls to a remote server to get data, you can store the important data locally and retrieve it quickly.

Depending on the type of data you have, there are different storage options available. When you're working with data that is relational in nature, a database is the best option. 

You can create a local database in the Xamarin application by using SQLite. SQLite.NET is a C# wrapper around SQLite. It exposes an asynchronous API to help ensure that the UI of the application always remains responsive.
