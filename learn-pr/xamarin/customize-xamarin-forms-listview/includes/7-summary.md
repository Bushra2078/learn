Xamarin.Forms `ListView` controls give us more than just the ability to display collections of data in predefined layouts. We can customize the structure and visual design of most elements of the `ListView`.

In this module, we modified an application by using a built-in cell template. We changed the app to use custom templates and to choose the most appropriate template based on the data being represented. We then grouped our rows together to make browsing easier for users.

We can build on many of the things we did in this module to make our `ListView` controls even more customized. The [Xamarin.Forms documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/listview/) has information on these techniques and more:

- Add a quick index to a grouped `ListView` to let the user jump to a particular group.
- Use full custom layouts for group headers.
- Add full table headers and footers (including fully customized header layouts).
- Customize rows and change the height of rows at runtime.
- Add context menus to rows.
- Enable pull-to-refresh.
