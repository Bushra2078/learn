Building a great application means creating a clear navigation path through your content. Your UI should allow users to quickly switch between related pages or the elements of a collection.

Suppose you're using Xamarin.Forms to write an app for a planetarium. You want to generate interest in astronomy by presenting astronomical facts and concepts that are relevant to everyday life. The app will have pages covering sunrise/sunset, lunar phases, astronomical bodies, and a page about the app. You'll also need to show the collection of planets and let the user select a planet to see its details. Your job is to build a navigation system that minimizes the UI dedicated to navigation while making all content easily available.

In this module, you'll explore two UI techniques that use a master-detail relationship. First, you'll learn how to switch between several pages of content by using drawer navigation. Second, you'll create a true master-detail UI that enables users to browse through a large collection of data while taking advantage of available screen space.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use `MasterDetailPage` in Xamarin.Forms to implement drawer navigation and a master-detail view of a collection.
