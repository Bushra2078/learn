We used `MasterDetailPage` to code both drawer navigation and master-detail navigation. The same class supports both patterns by providing a `MasterBehavior` property. This property lets you control whether the master view is presented as a slide-out drawer or sits side by side with the detail view. 

Both approaches require similar steps, but are used in different scenarios. Drawer is for navigating distinct pages of an app. Master-detail is great for displaying a collection.
