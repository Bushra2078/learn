It's difficult to design a user interface that looks the same across devices. Each device could have a different form factor, size, and pixel density. You'd need to write more code to make sure your app looks great on all devices.

Xamarin.Forms provides layout panels to help solve this problem. With `StackLayout` and `Grid`, you have extensive control over the arrangement of your views. Using the layout strategies you've learned, you can develop apps that adapt to all your users' many devices.
