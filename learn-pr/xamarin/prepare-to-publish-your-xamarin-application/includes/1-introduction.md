The goal for many developers is to ship their apps to customers. The main way to ship mobile applications is through the iOS and Android app stores. But there are many steps between code complete and submitting your app to the store.

In this module, you'll learn how to prepare your app for publishing. You'll enhance your user interface, use the Linker to reduce the size of your app, and choose the best store for shipping your app. These preparation steps are the same no matter which platforms you support or which stores you intend to use.
