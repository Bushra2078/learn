In this module, you learned the final steps that you should take before distributing or publishing your app.

You learned how to prepare your app from the perspective of Xamarin tooling (for example, by using the Xamarin Linker). There are additional platform-specific requirements that you also need to consider. These requirements, like creating an iOS provision profile or signing your Android application package, are typically addressed as part of your app's setup.

Also, the ecosystem for each mobile platform changes often. These changes might include new requirements about imagery or changes in the build process for the platform.

It's a good idea to review the platform-specific documentation to make sure you're up to date with the latest requirements for each platform.

For *iOS apps*, take a look at:

- [Xamarin.iOS app distribution overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/)

    Get an overview of distribution options and links to more detailed documents on the distribution process.

    For example, you'll find links to information about [App Store distribution](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/app-store-distribution/index), [configuring an App in iTunes Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/app-distribution/app-store-distribution/itunesconnect), and [troubleshooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/troubleshooting).

For *Android applications*, take a look at:

- [Preparing an application for release](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/deploy-test/release-prep/?tabs=windows)

    Get additional platform-specific information about the Android package creation process.

- [Signing the Android application package](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/deploy-test/signing/?tabs=windows)

    Learn about the Android package signing process.

- [Publishing an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/deploy-test/publishing/)

    Get a quick overview of the publishing process and information about several distribution channels.

    For example, you'll learn how to publish to [Google Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/deploy-test/publishing/publishing-to-google-play/?tabs=windows) and the [Amazon App Store for Android](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/deploy-test/publishing/publishing-to-amazon).
