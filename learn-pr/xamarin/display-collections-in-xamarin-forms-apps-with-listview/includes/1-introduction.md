Mobile applications often display lists of data in a scrollable panel. They use this style because mobile devices are small and screen space is limited.

Suppose you're building an educational app about the flags of various countries/regions. Your UI will show a list of countries/regions and their respective flags along with some extra information like the date the flag was adopted. The list of the countries/regions can't fit on one screen.  You need a control to display the list in a scrollable panel. Xamarin.Forms provides the `ListView` control for this type of situation.

In this module, you'll use `ListView` to display a list of data. You'll start by populating the `ListView` control with simple string values. You'll add interactivity to respond when the user selects a row. Finally, you'll customize the appearance of each row to include an image and multiple labels. By the end of this module, you'll be able to build a Xamarin.Forms application that displays a dynamic set of data in a scrollable container.
