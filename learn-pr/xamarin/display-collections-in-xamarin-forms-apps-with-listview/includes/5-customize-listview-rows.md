When you display a list of content to your users, you'll rarely want to display only a single string value. Most applications display multiple pieces of information in each row. For example, the rows of a Twitter feed display the author's username and profile picture, the date, and the contents of the tweet.

In this unit, you'll see how to customize the appearance of your `ListView` rows by including multiple controls.

## How are rows visually represented by default?

Recall that by default, `ListView` calls `ToString` on each item in its collection to visualize the item on the screen. For example, the following screenshot shows what the visualization might look like for the cooking app:

![Screenshot showing a ListView collection of string data by calling ToString on each item.](../media/5-default-row.png)

This style isn't ideal. You'll typically want to display multiple things, customize the position of the text, or choose specific colors.

The default visualization also presents a problem with changes. `ListView` can't detect changes to the underlying data even if you're using property notification changes. `ListView` calls `ToString` only once when it first displays the row. It doesn't realize it needs to call `ToString` every time the underlying data changes.

To fix these problems, you need to control how the row presents your data.

## Alter the visual representation of a row

To alter the visual representation of a row, you need to supply an *item template*. An item template is a set of visual instructions for a nonvisual piece of data. You set the item template by using the `ListView` property called `ItemTemplate`.

### What is DataTemplate?

`DataTemplate` is an item template that's used to specify the appearance of data. You can think of it as instructions for how to display a row.

You define `DataTemplate` and load it into the `ItemTemplate` property of your `ListView` control. `ListView` repeats the `DataTemplate` instructions once for each row. The following code shows how you would create `DataTemplate` in XAML and assign it to your `ListView` control:

```xaml
<ListView ...>
   <ListView.ItemTemplate>
      <DataTemplate>
         ...
      </DataTemplate>
   </ListView.ItemTemplate>
</ListView>
```

`ListView` expects the `DataTemplate` you give it to create something that's of the abstract type `Cell`. Xamarin.Forms provides built-in `Cell` types that you can use for most scenarios. These `Cell` types include predefined views and offer only a few options for customization.

- `TextCell`: A row that has a main text label and a details text label
- `EntryCell`: A row that has a label and an editable entry
- `SwitchCell`: A row that has a label and a switch
- `ImageCell`: A row that has an image on the left and two labels

This screenshot shows an example of the four predefined cell types.

![Screenshot showing an example of TextCell, EntryCell, SwitchCell, and ImageCell on an iOS device.](../media/5-cells.png)

If none of the prebuilt cells work for your data, you can build an entirely custom visualization. You'd start with `ViewCell` inside your `DataTemplate` and add a layout panel with all the controls you need.

### Provide data to a cell

You use data binding to provide data to a cell. The `ListView` control will automatically set `BindingContext` for a cell to the data item from the `ItemsSource*` instance that the row needs to display. The following XAML shows how to use `TextCell` to display a recipe.

```xaml
<ListView.ItemTemplate>
   <DataTemplate>
        <TextCell Text="{Binding Name}" Detail="{Binding PrepTime}" DetailColor="Gray" />
    </DataTemplate>
</ListView.ItemTemplate>
```

In this example, we start by setting our `DataTemplate` to a `TextCell` instance. A `TextCell` instance has two labels: one named `Text` and the other named `Detail`. We use data binding to pull values from the recipe object to show in these labels. The XAML also shows how `TextCell` gives you some control over the appearance by providing the `DetailColor` property.
