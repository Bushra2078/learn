Using the same fonts and colors across your entire UI creates a consistent look and feel. Xamarin.Forms provides a way to define these values in one place and look them up everywhere they're used. Reusing values guarantees consistency across your app and makes updates simple.

Suppose you're building a mobile application called **Tip Calculator**. The app is used in the hospitality industry and allows attendants to quickly calculate the gratuity for any service. Your company recently changed the look of its corporate brand. Your job is to update the app's UI to match the new look. You'll need to change fonts, text colors, and background colors. You want to make this kind of update easy because there will be more branding changes as your company grows.

Here, you'll see how to define and apply a resource both in code and in XAML. You'll also group multiple settings into a style so you can apply them all at once.
