Xamarin.Forms is a framework for creating cross-platform native mobile apps with C# and XAML, by using Visual Studio.

Suppose you work for a national grocery store chain. The chain wants to expand their loyalty program with a mobile app. The new app allows one-touch dialing to the store, and also pushes notifications about special offers when the user is at the store. The app therefore needs access to some hardware features.

You've been tasked with identifying the technology and building a proof-of-concept. You identify Xamarin.Forms as a likely technology choice. Xamarin.Forms allows you to share code, share markup for creating a user interface (UI), and easily access hardware and platform-specific features, like the phone dialer and location services. Additionally, with Xamarin.Forms you can make use of the C# skills of the developers you already work with.
