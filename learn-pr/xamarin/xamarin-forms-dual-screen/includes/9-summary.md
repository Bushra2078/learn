Xamarin.Forms dual-screen support provides a foundation upon which to build responsive app layouts that work well on all devices, with enhanced useability on devices like the Microsoft Surface Duo.

In this module, we modified an application by adding `TwoPaneView` and `DualScreenInfo` to preserve the single-screen user experience while adding dual-screen support, and responding appropriately when the app is spanned to two screens (or moved back to one).

We can build on the classes introduced in this module to make our application even more responsive to different devices:

- Further customize the view when a Surface Duo is in dual-landscape ("tall") mode.
- Detect the hinge angle and adapt the user-interface in some way.
- Use [XAML triggers](/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/dual-screen/triggers) to create responsive dual-screen apps.
