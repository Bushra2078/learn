What if you could spend all your time building and deploying great apps, and none of your time managing servers? Serverless computing lets you do just that, because the infrastructure you need to run and scale your apps is managed for you.

One of the most basic ways to go serverless is to use an Azure storage account to host a static website. You'll first create this account and then, in subsequent tutorials in this learning module, you'll enhance this website by adding other Azure services.

In the tutorial, you will:
- Learn about Azure Storage.
- Host a website in Azure Blob Storage.

At the end of the tutorial, you can check your knowledge about this information with a quiz challenge.
