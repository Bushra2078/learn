## Overview of Azure Storage

Microsoft Azure Storage is a managed cloud service that provides storage that is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant. As a managed service you don't have to handle maintenance or critical problems.

Azure Storage consists of three data services: Blob storage, File storage, and Queue storage. For this unit you'll only be concerned with Blob storage.
