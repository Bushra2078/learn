The serverless solution that you're building uses three Azure functions. One of the functions is used by Azure Event Grid for new pictures that are uploaded and sent to be processed by the computer vision API. The other two functions back the APIs that the website uses, to upload images and retrieve the list of images.

In this tutorial, you will:
- Learn about Azure Functions.
- Create Azure functions.
- Hook your serverless app to your new functions.

At the end of the tutorial, you can check your knowledge about this information with a quiz challenge.
