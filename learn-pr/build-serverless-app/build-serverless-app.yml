    In this unit, you build a basic web application that can host your static files on Azure Blob Storage. Azure Functions are used to host an API that your static files call, which is additionally triggered by Event Grid to process the uploaded image files. Computer Vision API is used to process and caption each image. Finally, the image metadata is stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
