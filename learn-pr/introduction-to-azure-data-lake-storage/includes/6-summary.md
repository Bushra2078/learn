<!-- 1. Goal and criteria-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Recap that this module's goal is 'evaluate' using the provided decision criteria.

    Format: Short text followed by a bulleted list of the decision criteria developed in the "When to use <product>" unit.

    Heading: none

    Example: "Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Logic Apps would be a good choice for your business process. We developed some criteria you can use to guide your decision:
    * Integration
    * Performance
    * Conditionals
    * Connectors"

-->
Our goal in this module was to help you evaluate whether Azure Data Lake Storage would be the right choice for your big data storage requirements. To help you make that decisions, we presented some criteria you can use:

* Costs
* Data access
* Data insights
* Real-time analytics

<!-- 2. Show how you solved the scenario problem(s)---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Briefly summarize how you applied the decision criteria to the scenario problem(s). Ideally, discuss two scenarios, one where the product was appropriate and one where it wasn't.

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "We applied these criteria to our fictional shoe company. The analysis helped us see how difficult it would be to use Logic Apps for each process. Both the social-media monitor and the video archive utility used only the built-in connectors. This characteristic made them perfect for Logic Apps. The online sales portal required more work because it had complex conditionals and needed custom connectors."
 -->

We applied these criteria in the context of an organization that currently uses a traditional, on-premises data warehouse. You learned that in most scenarios Azure Data Lake Storage offers lower TCO, increased data access, enhanced support for extracting business insights, and superior tools for ingesting and analyzing real-time data.

However, you also learned that organizations with relatively small and slow data needs, a single type of data, an emphasis on business analysis, and no streaming data to process would probably not benefit by switching to Azure Data Lake Storage.

<!-- 3. Describe the business impact ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: explain how choosing the right product is important

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "The criteria help you evaluate whether your business processes are a good match for Logic Apps. First, they let you assess how well Logic Apps will solve your problem. Second, they give you an idea of the amount of customization effort involved in using them for your task. This process should give you enough information to choose the right product for your work."
 -->
The criteria help you compare Azure Data Lake Storage with more traditional forms of data storage. Business decisions, customer satisfaction, and the ability to steer your organization optimally all depend on controlling costs, having ready access to data, and being able to mine that data for useful insights. The process you went through here should give you enough information to choose the right data storage solution for your organization.

<!-- 4. References (optional) ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide a few recommendations for further study via a bulleted list of links. This is optional and intended to be used sparingly.
        - use the target page title as the text for your link
        - do not include other text such as a description
        - prefer other first-party sites like Docs reference pages
        - link to third-party sites only when they are trusted and authoritative
        - do not link to other Learn content ("next steps" recommendations are generated automatically)
        - avoid linking to opinion sites such as blog posts

    Heading: "## References"
