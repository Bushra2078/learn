Our goal in this module was to help you evaluate whether Azure Data Lake Storage would be the correct choice for your big data storage requirements. To help you make that decisions, we presented some criteria you can use:

- Costs
- Data access
- Data insights
- Real-time analytics

We applied these criteria in the context of our fictional organization that currently uses a traditional, on-premises data warehouse. You learned that in most scenarios, Azure Data Lake Storage offers:

- Lower TCO.
- Increased data access.
- Enhanced support for extracting business insights.
- Superior tools for ingesting and analyzing real-time data.

However, you also learned that organizations would probably not benefit from Azure Data Lake Storage if they have:

- Relatively small and slow data needs.
- A single type of data.
- An emphasis on business analysis.
- No streaming data to process.

The criteria help you compare Azure Data Lake Storage with more traditional forms of data storage. Business decisions, customer satisfaction, and the ability to steer your organization optimally all depend on several factors. The most important ones are cost control, ready access to data, and the ability to mine that data for useful insights. The process you went through here should give you enough information to choose the right data storage solution for your organization.
