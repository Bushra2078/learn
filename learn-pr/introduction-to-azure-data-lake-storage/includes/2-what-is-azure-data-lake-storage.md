<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) ---------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly state that this unit will define the product.

    Heading: none

    Example: "Let's start with a few definitions and a quick tour of the core features of Logic Apps. This overview should help you see whether Logic Apps might be a good fit for your work."
-->
Let's begin with a quick look at Azure Data Lake Storage, including what it is and what are its core features. This overview should help you decide whether Azure Data Lake Storage is worth looking into as a solution for your company's data storage requirements.
<!-- 2. Background-concept definitions (optional) ----------------------------------------

    Goal:
        Define any needed underlying concepts or terms the learner must know to understand the product.
        Repeat this pattern multiple times if multiple concepts are needed.

    Heading:
        "## What is <concept>?"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that gives a definition "<concept> is..." (ensure this is a definition, do not give use cases like "<concept> lets you...").
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-3 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        (Note: the product "Logic Apps" implements business processes in the cloud; therefore, "business process" is a background concept.)
        Heading: "What is a business process?
        Lead sentence: "A business process or _workflow_ is a sequence of tasks that produce a specific outcome. The result might be a decision, some data, or a notification...."
-->

## What is a data lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that enables you to store all your data — both structured and unstructured — in a single location. With a data lake, there's no need to conform your data to fit an existing structure. Instead, you can store your data in its raw or native format, usually as files or as binary large objects (blobs).

When evaluating whether a data lake is the right solution for your company, there are several elements to consider, as described in the following table.

| Element        | Description           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Data speed      | A data lake must be able to ingest data at any speed: from the occasional file to large relational data imports to realtime data generated by web server logs or IoT devices. |
| Data scalability | Since a data lake might be required to store massive amounts of data that arrive in realtime, the storage must be highly scalable to keep up with the demand. |
| Data availability | Once files, blobs, or relational data are stored in a data lake, they must be readily available through browsing, searching, and indexing of the data. |
| Data security      | Most data lakes store crucial data assets, including line-of-business data, company-developed apps, and productivity output. The data lake requires robust security to protect these assets.    |
| Data analytics | A data lake must store data in a way that enables business analysts, data scientists, and AI modelers to use their preferred tools to analyze the data in place to derive business intelligence, insights, trends, and forecasts.

A data lake enables your organization to quickly and easily store, access, and analyze a wide variety of data in a single location.

<!-- 3. Define the product -------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        Give a formal and precise definition of the product.

    Heading:
        "## Azure Data Lake Storage definition"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that gives a definition "Azure Data Lake Storage is..." (ensure this is a definition, do not give use cases like "Azure Data Lake Storage lets you...").
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-3 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        Heading: "Azure Logic Apps definition"
        Lead sentence: "Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that automates the execution of your business processes."
-->

<!-- 4. Solve the scenario -------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        At a high level, describe how the Azure Data Lake Storage solves one of the customer tasks in your <scenario>.
        Avoid teaching how to actually do the work (you're not teaching how-to-use in this module).

    Heading:
        "## How to <solve scenario>"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that summarizes how the Azure Data Lake Storage solved the <scenario>.
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-2 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        Heading: "How to implement a Twitter monitor"
        Lead sentence: "To implement a Twitter monitor, you map each task to a Logic Apps component and connect them with conditional logic."
-->

## How to <solve scenario

TODO: Add your lead sentence
TODO: Add your additional text
TODO: Add your visual element

<!-- 5. Additional content (optional, as needed) ------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        The section is a catch-all for any information not covered in the sections above.
        Repeat the pattern here as many times as needed.

    Possible topics:
        - Key feature(s).
        - Example use case in addition to the scenario.
        - High-level of how practitioners use the product (e.g. there's an API and a web UI to support multiple use cases).
        - Business value (e.g. it lets you do something that would be difficult to achieve without Azure Data Lake Storage).

    Pattern:
        Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
            1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk.
            2. 1-3 paragraphs of text, with a strong lead sentence in the first paragraph.
            3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).
