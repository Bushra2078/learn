  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options is an Azure Data Lake Storage feature that enhances big data performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hierarchical namespace"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The hierarchical namespace improves data performance by enabling efficient data access and navigation."
    - content: "Accepts a variety of data types"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Azure Data Lake Storage can store any type of data, that flexibility doesn't improve performance."
    - content: "Data redundancy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Azure Data Lake Storage offers both locally redundant and geo-redundant storage to help ensure that data is always available and protected in case of an outage, that redundancy doesn't directly improve data performance."
  - content: "Which of the following tools helps to ingest real-time data from an IoT device?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Storage Explorer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can use Azure Storage Explorer to ingest ad-hoc data that resides on a local computer. However, it doesn't ingest real-time data."
    - content: "Azure Data Factory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can use Azure Data Factory to ingest Azure Storage Blob data and data from an on-premises relational database management system. However, it doesn't ingest real-time data."
    - content: "Azure Stream Analytics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Stream Analytics reads data from an Azure IoT Hub resource and outputs the data to Azure Data Lake Storage."
  - content: "A data administrator is considering the benefits of Azure Data Lake Storage to reduce costs. The administrator's organization currently runs an on-premises data warehouse that's becoming increasingly expensive. From the point of view of reducing TCO, which of the following statements is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Storage separates storage costs from compute costs. So as data volume grows, only storage requirements need to grow with the data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Data Lake Storage runs on virtual hardware on the Azure platform, so storage is massively scalable and entirely separate from any compute hardware concerns."
    - content: "Azure services such as Azure Stream Analytics, Azure HDInsight, and Azure Databricks are included in the cost of an Azure Data Lake Storage instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Instances of Azure services (such as Azure Stream Analytics, Azure HDInsight, and Azure Databricks) have their own pricing models and aren't included in Azure Data Lake Storage pricing."
    - content: "With an Azure Data Lake Storage instance, you must pay extra for maintenance and backups of your data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no extra charge incurred for maintenance of any Azure hardware or for making data backups."
  - content: "An administrator wants to remove data silos that are hampering the organization's ability to innovate and grow. They are researching the Azure Data Lake Storage features that help to eliminate data silos and increase data democratization. From the point of view of eliminating data silos, which of the following statements is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Storage gives users a single point of entry for accessing data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Data Lake Storage offers many tools for accessing data such as Azure Data Explorer, command-line tools such as PowerShell and Azure CLI, and the Azure portal."
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Storage gives users access to all data formats."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Data Lake Storage uses a hierarchical namespace and blob storage to expose every type of stored data to exploration by users."
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Storage gives all users complete access to all the data stored in the account."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although all of an account's data is potentially available, Azure Data Lake Storage lets administrators apply security constraints such as RBAC and ACLs to limit which security principals can review and modify data."
  - content: "A senior data engineer wants to build a recommendation engine to suggest products to the organization's customers. The project requires multiple datasets, including: overall purchases, purchases by customer, page views, search queries, and product ratings. From the point of view of building such an engine, which of the following statements is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "The engineer requires access only to structured data, so it would be better to build this engine in a data warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although much of the project data is likely structured, data such as the web server page views and search queries are likely to be in a semi-structured format."
    - content: "The project uses real-time data, so the engineer should consider using Azure Data Lake Storage because it can work with multiple Azure services that support real-time analytics."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Data Lake Storage can ingest real-time data from HDInsight Storm, Azure IoT Hub, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Stream Analytics."
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Storage can't output data to a service that would accomplish the goal of this project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Data Lake Storage supports many Azure services, including Azure Databricks for transforming data. It also includes Azure Machine Learning for training and deploying ML models."
