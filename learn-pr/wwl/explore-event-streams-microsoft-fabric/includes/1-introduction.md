When your company chooses Microsoft Fabric for real-time analytics (RTA), the first step is seamlessly ingesting data into your Fabric lakehouse. Eventstreams is a Microsoft Fabric feature that lets you handle real-time events without coding. You can set up event sources, destinations, and processors in the eventstream. Event processing is another option within evenstream for collecting and aggregating, filtering, grouping, change, expand, and join other events from Microsoft Fabric eventstreams for additional insights into the in-flight data.

eventstream main editor is the primary interface for setting up Fabric eventstreams and can be used to:

- Establish source and destinations
- View the data in-flight
- Capture, transform, and route data

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Fabric eventstreams to source, transform, process, and route event driven data the destinations that are necessary for your workloads.
