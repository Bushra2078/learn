When your company chooses Microsoft Fabric for real-time analytics (RTA), the first step is seamlessly ingesting data into your Fabric lakehouse. Eventstreams is a Microsoft Fabric feature that lets you handle real-time events without coding. You can set up event sources, destinations, and processors in the eventstream. EventStore is a Microsoft Fabric option that monitors events from the cluster and shows its state at any time. You can query events for any entity or entity type in the cluster, such as cluster, nodes, applications, services, partitions, and partition replicas. Eventstore can also link events that happened at the same time and affected each other, to help you find the causes of cluster activities. EventFlow is another option for collecting and aggregating events from Microsoft Fabric clusters.

event processor editor is the primary interface for setting up Fabric eventstreams and can be used to:

- Establish source and destinations
- View the data in-flight
- Capture, transform, and route data

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Fabric eventstreams to source, transform, process, and route event driven data the destinations that are necessary for your workloads.
