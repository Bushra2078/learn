The Windows Security Center, a component in Windows 11 and later versions, encompasses all facets of security for the operating system, user accounts, and applications on a particular device. Evolving from earlier iterations of Microsoft Defender anti-malware software, the Windows Security Center provides a comprehensive suite of security features designed to maintain the safety of your Windows device throughout its supported lifetime.

Windows Security Center is turned on, by default and it works from the moment you install Windows operating system. It covers the following areas:

 -  **Virus and threat protection:** help handle all anti-virus and anti-malware tasks.
 -  **Account protection:** allows you to configure account sign-in options, and Windows Hello sign-in options and Dynamic lock settings.

 -  **App and browser control:** In this part of Windows Security Center, you can configure the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen feature that helps you protect a device by proactively checking for unrecognized apps and files from the internet. The SmartScreen feature also works for Microsoft Edge and for Microsoft store apps.
 -  **Device security:** You can find information about processor core isolation, processor security, TPM and secure boot features.
 -  **Device performance &amp; health:** You can check if Windows is up to date and check for other issues that can impact general device health. You can check for storage capacity problems, device drives issues, battery life issues and apps and software issues. From here you can also initiate a fresh start for an installed copy of Windows.
