Windows 365 is a cutting-edge cloud-based service that simplifies how you create and manage virtual machines. It automatically generates a new Windows virtual machine called Cloud PCs for your end users. With Windows 365, each Cloud PC is assigned to an individual user, providing them with a dedicated Windows device. By using Windows 365, you can experience the benefits of Microsoft 365, which include increased productivity, enhanced security, and seamless collaboration. With these features, Windows 365 offers a flexible and scalable solution to support your organization's growth and changing needs.

Windows 365 is available in two editions:

 -  **Windows 365 Business:** Windows 365 Business is made specifically for use in smaller companies (up to 300 seats) who want ready-to-use Cloud PCs with simple management options. There are no licensing prerequisites to set up Windows 365 Business. There are no dependencies on Azure or Active Directory. Purchases are made through the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Windows 365 product site. For more information, see [Getting started with Windows 365 Business and Cloud PCs](/windows-365/business/get-started-windows-365-business).
 -  **Windows 365 Enterprise:** Windows 365 Enterprise is for larger companies who want unlimited seats for creating Cloud PCs. It includes options to create custom Cloud PCs based on your created device images, more management options, and full integration with Microsoft Intune. It leverages Azure AD and AD DS domains. For more information, see [What is Windows 365 Enterprise?](/windows-365/enterprise/overview).
