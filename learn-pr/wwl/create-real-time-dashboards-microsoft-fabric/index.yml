title: Create real time dashboards with Microsoft Fabric
summary: In this module, you'll learn about the Real-Time Dashboard in Microsoft Fabric and its user-friendly experience.
abstract: A dashboard is like a control center for Real-Time Intelligence. It contains different sections, or &quot;tiles,&quot; that can be spread out over several pages. Each tile shows live, up-to-date information based on a specific question or &quot;query&quot; you have. With Kusto Query Language (KQL), you can take these questions and turn them into visuals on your dashboard, and you can change both the questions and how they look anytime. This Real-Time Intelligence dashboard is great because it lets you explore data easily and shows you the latest info super fast and in a way that's easy to understand.
prerequisites: Familiarity with Microsoft Fabric.
