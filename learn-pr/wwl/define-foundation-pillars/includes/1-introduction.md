Your organization supports a critical business application deployed in the datacenter. Business is about to expand to new geographies and include new business areas and products. The existing application is 10 years old. It barely supports actual business and has no mobile capabilities. A new solution is necessary. It needs to make the most of new approaches, be cloud-based, and support mobile devices.
