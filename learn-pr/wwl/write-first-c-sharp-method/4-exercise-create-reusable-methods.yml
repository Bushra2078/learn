    choices:
    - content: "`ConvertCurrency();`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This line of code will execute the method."
    - content: "`ConvertCurrency() { }`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A return type must be declared before the method name."
    - content: "`void ConvertCurrency();`"

    choices:
    - content: "`var update;`"

    - content: "`Update();`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct! A method is called using its name followed by parentheses."
    - content: "`void Update();`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A method is called using its name followed by parentheses."
