Your organization supports a critical business application deployed across the globe in multiple regions. Each deployment currently takes 13 weeks on average. It requires the most senior technical elements to be on site with the deployment team to fix the many unpredicted issues that come up. Competition is fiercely deploying new functionalities to the market on a daily basis, and change is urgently needed. To land this change a major cultural shift must occur, as well as a process to identify the pain points, and those activities that donâ€™t add value. These activities need to be optimized or eliminated.

Siloed Development and Operations disciplines are being replaced to create multidisciplinary teams that work together with shared and efficient practices and tools.

**DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end-users. For Microsoft Services, it encompasses the entire software delivery lifecycle, from idea to applications running in production.**

We identified four foundation pillars that support the mindset and foundation for DevOps, derived from People/Process/Product: Culture, Lean Product, Architecture, and Technology.

Then we identified eight functions, or capabilities:
- Continuous Planning
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Quality
- Continuous Security
- Continuous Operations
- Continuous Collaboration
- Continuous Improvement

The first two pillars in our view of DevOps are **Culture** and **Lean Product**.

Gartner research shows that through 2023, 90% of DevOps initiatives will fail because of the limitations of management approaches used by leadership. The primary responsibility of leadership is the creation of an environment that enables a DevOps Culture.

Lean Product Management refers to a way of discovering products that embraces user-centrism. It acknowledges that product teams are on a continuous journey of solving well-understood end-user problems in as lean a manner as possible. It separates the concerns of **why** a product matters, **what** the product is, and **how** it's built.
