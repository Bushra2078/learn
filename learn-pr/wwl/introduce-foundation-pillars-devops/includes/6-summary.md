Your organization supports a critical business application deployed across the globe in multiple regions. Each deployment currently takes 13 weeks on average. It requires the most senior technical elements to be on site with the deployment team to fix the many unpredicted issues that come up. Competition is fiercely deploying new functionalities to the market on a daily basis, and change is urgently needed. To land this change a major cultural shift must occur, as well as a process to identify the pain points, and those activities that don’t add value. These activities need to be optimized or eliminated.

Siloed Development and Operations disciplines are being replaced to create multidisciplinary teams that work together with shared and efficient practices and tools.

**DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end-users. For Microsoft Services, it encompasses the entire software delivery lifecycle, from idea to applications running in production.**

We identified four foundation pillars that support the mindset and foundation for DevOps, derived from People/Process/Product: Culture, Lean Product, Architecture, and Technology.

Then we identified eight functions, or capabilities:

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery

- Continuous Security
- Continuous Operations
- Continuous Collaboration

Gartner research shows that through 2023, 90% of DevOps initiatives will fail because of the limitations of management approaches used by leadership. The primary responsibility of leadership is the creation of an environment that enables a DevOps Culture.

Lean Product Management shows the product-development process is not an occasional endeavor. It’s a continuous process of improvement of the product through the delivery of new features.
