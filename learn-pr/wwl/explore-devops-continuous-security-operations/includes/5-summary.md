Your organization supports a critical business web application deployed across the globe in multiple regions. The infrastructure includes thousands of components. **Security is not something you can add at the end of the project and a fluent operation process is essential to maintain platform health.**

Continuous Security is a practice that ensures security is an integral part of the software delivery lifecycle. It maintains a holistic view of:

- Secure architecture
- Governance, risk, and compliance
- App security
- Data security
- Infrastructure security
- Operations security
- Endpoint security  
- Identity and access security  

In a traditional software development lifecycle, security is often considered in the testing stages as part of a security resilience test. Collaboration between operations, security and compliance, and developers is often done reactively through incident management and problem management processes. With Continuous Security, collaboration between Development, Security, and Operations is continuous. When Development, Security, and Operations come together to fix production issues, they have already worked together. Additionally, instead of doing security at the last step, in Operations, it can be incorporated earlier and in an integrated way.

Always assume you have been breached. Make defense-in-depth at each level central to your organizationâ€™s security posture. Remember that your organization can grow their security DevOps culture by promoting awareness, building security principles, and living by them.

The costs of a breach often go well beyond the loss of sales and trust in a company. Complex systems do fail and can cause costly outages and interruptions. The number of web and mobile applications, and the frequency of application releases, keeps increasing. Continuous Operations helps you with all these situations, reducing or eliminating the need for planned downtimes or interruptions. A user should never know that upgrades or releases have occurred!

A large part of the value of DevOps in general is about finding the right balance between innovation (speed) and business continuity (control). To evolve into a DevOps approach, a major paradigm shift needs to occur in the culture to deliver business value with a modern IT approach. It's not a simple task, but it will result in simplified and automated processes, aligned outcome incentives, reduced risk, and a customer-centric approach.
