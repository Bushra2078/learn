In this lab, you'll create a Microsoft Fabric notebook and use PySpark to connect to an Azure Blob Storage path, then load the data into a lakehouse using write optimizations.

This lab will take approximately **20** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: You'll need a Microsoft Fabric license to complete this exercise. See [Getting started with Fabric](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) for details of how to enable a free Fabric trial license. You will need a Microsoft *school* or *work* account to do this. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a trial of Microsoft Office 365 E3 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans).
