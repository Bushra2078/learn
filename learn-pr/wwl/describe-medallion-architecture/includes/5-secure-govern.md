## Secure your lakehouse

Secure your lakehouse by ensuring that only authorized users can access data. In Fabric, you can do this by setting permissions at the workspace or item level.

Strategically store different layers in separate workspaces for improved security and efficient capacity management. This approach not only enhances security but also optimizes cost-effectiveness.

- Security and Access Considerations: Define who needs access at each layer, ensuring only authorized personnel can interact with sensitive data.
- Gold Layer Access Control: Restrict access to the Gold layer for read-only purposes, emphasizing the importance of minimal permissions.
- Silver Layer Utilization: Decide whether users will be allowed to build upon the Silver layer, balancing flexibility and security.
- Bronze Layer Access Control: Restrict access to the Bronze layer for read-only purposes, emphasizing the importance of minimal permissions.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

Deployment Pipeline Implementation: Identify the pivotal role of deployment pipelines in the Gold layer. Implement robust deployment pipelines to ensure seamless and controlled movement of data and transformations.

CI/CD Integration: Recognize the significance of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, particularly at the Gold layer. These practices streamline development, testing, and deployment, promoting a reliable and agile data environment.
