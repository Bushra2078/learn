This module is focused on how Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) use [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) and its workspaces to manage business relationships. Partner Center is a web-based tool that streamlines several business processes so that Microsoft partners can easily manage their relationships with their customers and Microsoft.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a cloud provider and want to partner with Microsoft. The rapidly growing demand for cloud-based solutions and services means many opportunities for Microsoft partners of all sizes to build profitable cloud solution businesses.

There are two models from which to choose in the CSP program: the **indirect** model and the **direct-bill** model.

With the **indirect** model, you can purchase from an indirect provider who can collaborate with you for customer support and billing.

With the **direct-bill** model, you can purchase Microsoft products and subscriptions directly from Microsoft and sell them directly to your customers through your in-house sales staff.

As a CSP, you'd like to be more involved in your customers' businesses beyond reselling licenses so that you can provide them:

- **Deeper customer engagements**: Meeting regularly with your customers means you'll develop a better understanding of their business and needs.
- **Increased profits**: Offering increased support and billing services, whether on your own or through an indirect provider, opens up new revenue streams.
- **Added value**: You'll be able to offer customers industry-specific solutions bundled with Microsoft products.
- **Managed services**: You'll be well positioned to meet customer demand for managed services.

You'll use **Partner Center** throughout your CSP journey. It'll help you:

- Manage **Account settings** for you and your users.
- Download invoices and reconciliation files in the **Billing** workspace.
- Connect with your **Customers**.
- Explore **Incentives** programs offered by Microsoft.
- Get valuable **Insights** on how to grow your business.
- Discover and manage **Referrals**.
- Get **Pricing** information on the products you want to sell.
