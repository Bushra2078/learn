  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the one tool you don't need to build your first Mixed Reality (XR) experience?"
    choices:
    - content: "Mixed Reality headset"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You don't need a Mixed Reality headset to get started prototyping XR experiences. Simulators are available for more frameworks."
    - content: "A code editor or IDE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If you want to build a Mixed Reality experience, you'll need to write code in some way."
    - content: "Mixed Reality framework"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While technically possible to write your own framework, building off of an existing framework supports a Mixed Reality experience."
  - content: "What's one primary difference between Babylon.js and the Mixed Reality Toolkit?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Mixed Reality Toolkit is the only framework that works with Microsoft HoloLens. Babylon.js only works on browsers and mobile phones."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it's true Babylon.js works on browsers and mobile phones, a Mixed Reality experience built with Babylon.js can also be deployed to HoloLens."
    - content: "BabylonJS can only show 2D objects, while the Mixed Reality Toolkit only shows 3D objects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Both frameworks can show 2D and 3D objects in Mixed Reality experiences."
    - content: "The Mixed Reality Toolkit relies on Unity's idea of objects and scripts, while Babylon.js is more similar to traditional web development with common objects and events, but in a 3D space."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. While both frameworks can create similar experiences, the game-development platform model of Unity lends more to 3D objects while the web-development application of Babylon.js lends more to events."
  - content: "What is a common format for loading data in object-centric software development, such as in Mixed Reality experiences?"
    choices:
    - content: "CSV"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While comma-separated value (CSV) files are an effective way to store data, when you load data into code, JSON provides more structured information."
    - content: "DOCX"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Document files aren't typically used in data-centric experiences because they don't provide an object-like structure to data."
    - content: "JSON"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a common way to store structured information for quick use in development."
    - content: "TXT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Text files aren't typically used in data-centric experiences because they don't provide an object-like structure to data."
