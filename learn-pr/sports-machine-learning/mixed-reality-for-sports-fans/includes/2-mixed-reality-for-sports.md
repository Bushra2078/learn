Data is a major part of sports for players, coaches, and fans. Whether you're choosing players for a fantasy league or providing why your favorite player is the greatest of all time (GOAT), you're likely using player stats, which are also known as data.

If you're following along the learning path inspired by *Space Jam: A New Legacy* or you're an avid basketball fan, you might be familiar with player efficiency rating (PER). This statistic kept for basketball players takes into account data points from across a player's career, such as minutes played and points scored. For example, at the time of writing this module, LeBron James has the highest PER of any current NBA player.

In the second module of this learning path, you created a web app where a basketball coach could have all of their players on the app and their current PER values. The coach could choose which players to put in the game based on their cumulative PER scores.

In the next two modules of this learning path, you'll explore how to build a fan view of this same web app by using Mixed Reality.

Your Mixed Reality experience will feature 16 members of the Tune Squad in their full Tune Squad uniform. Whether you're using Babylon.js, a web-based framework, or the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit, a Unity-based framework, you'll build a Mixed Reality experience for the first time!

The best part? You don't need a Mixed Reality headset to complete either of the following modules.

In the next unit, you'll make sure you have all the tools and data you need to make these experiences come to life.
