Data is a major part of sports for players, coaches, and fans. Whether you're choosing players for a fantasy league, or proviving why your favorite player is the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time), you're likely using player stats - also known as data.

If you're following along the *Space Jam: A New Legacy* inspired learning path, or you're an avid basketball fan, you might be familiar with PER: Player Efficiency Rating. This is a statistic that is kept for basketball players that takes into account data points from across a player's career (minutes played, points scored, etc). We know that, at the time of writing this module, LeBron James has the highest PER of any current NBA player, for example.

In the second module of this learning path, you created a web app where a basketball coach could have all of their player's on the app and their current PER values. The coach could choose which players to put in the game based on their cumulative PER scores.

In the next two modules of this learning path, you will explore how to build a fan view of this same web app - using Mixed Reality.

Your Mixed Reality experience will feature 16 members of the Tune Squad, in their full-Tune Squad uniform. Whether using BabylonJS, a web-based framework, or the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit, a Unity-based framework, you will build a Mixed Reality experience for the first time!

The best part? You do not need a Mixed Reality headset to complete either of the following modules!

In the next unit you'll make sure you have all of the tools and data you need to make these experiences come to life.
