Getting your data ready for the mixed reality world is mostly a matter of making sure you have complete JSON files.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating images and 3D models is beyond the scope of this Learn module, but that would be an additional step if you were creating a mixed reality experience from scratch. In this module, you'll use existing images and ensuring images and data is correlated.

In the previous module from this *Space Jam: A New Legacy*-inspired learning path, you created a web application that displayed players and their PER values for a basketball coach to decide which players to put on the court and which to give a rest to ensure a healthy team.

The data behind this web app was a CSV (comma-separated-value) file called `game_stats.csv`. You can find the [sample file on the GitHub repository here](https://github.com/microsoft/space-jam-a-new-legacy-template/blob/main/game_stats.csv?azure-portal=true).

For the BabylonJS and Mixed Reality Toolkit
For the BabylonJS mixed reality project, you'll be able to pull all of the images of the Tune Squad from the web. To do that, you'll need a JSON file that has each player's:

- Name
- PER
- Image URL

Luckily, you can use a little bit of Python to do this.

## Convert CSV to JSON with Python

To convert the CSV file from the previous module into a JSON file to be used in the next module, do the following:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Open a new folder, for example, `ConvertCSV`.
1. Create a new file, for example, `convert.py`.
1. Download the CSV file by going to the file on GitHub and selecting **Raw**. Or, [open this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/space-jam-a-new-legacy-template/main/game_stats.csv?azure-portal=true). Then, right-click anywhere on the screen, and select **Save As**.
1. Move the `game_stats.csv` file into the `ConvertCSV` folder you created in Visual Studio Code.

You should have the following set up in Visual Studio Code.

# Write the CSV Reader

Next, you need to extract only the relevant parts of the CSV file, such as the name and PER for each player.

Make sure you imported the csv package, and create a set of constants that will represent your current team.

```python
import csv

# The name of the player is in the second column (index 1).
NAME_INDEX = 1

# The PER of the player is in the 10th column (index 9).
PER_INDEX = 9

# There are only 15 players that we are reading in.
COUNT = 15
```

The CSV file has the PER for each player four times (one for each quarter of a game). You only need the first PER value (the value before the game has started).

Use the following code to open the CSV file, go through the first 15 rows (after the header), and create a list of names, PERs, and the URL where the image of the player can be found.

```python
# Open the game_stats.csv file.
with open('game_stats.csv') as csv_file:
    # Use the CSV reader and confirm the delimeter is a comma.
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')

    # Initialize the counter and empty lists.
    character_count = 0
    names = []
    pers = []
    urls = []

    # Loop through each row in the CSV file.
    for row in csv_reader:
        # Ignore the first row, since that is the header.
        if character_count == 0:
            character_count += 1
        # Only take data from the first 15 because we only need the player's initial PER, not for each quarter.
        elif character_count <= COUNT:
            # The name of the player is in the second column (at index 1).
            names.append(row[NAME_INDEX])

            # The image file of the player is their name with no spaces or period and all lowercase.
            urls.append("https://sjanlassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/" + row[NAME_INDEX].replace(" ","").replace(".","").lower()+".png")

            # The PER of the player is in the 10th row (at index 9).
            pers.append(row[PER_INDEX])

            # Increment the counter so we only get one set of data for each player.
            character_count += 1
        else:
            break
```

Finally, you can write all of this to a JSON file. Open the JSON file in write mode so that you overwrite anything that was already there. Then, loop through the 15 players and create a JSON object for each player.

```python
# Create a players.json file if it isn't already created and open it.
# The paramter "w" will overwrite the file if anything is in it.
f = open("players.json", "w")

# Write the opening bracket of the JSON object to the file.
f.write("[\n")

# Iterate over all of the players.
for index in range(0,COUNT):
    # Write the opening bracket of the first player object to the file.
    f.write("\t{\n")

    # Write the name, PER, and image url, with their labels, to the file
    f.write("\t\t\"name\": \""+names[index]+"\",\n")
    f.write("\t\t\"per\": \""+pers[index]+"\",\n")
    f.write("\t\t\"imgUrl\": \""+urls[index]+"\"\n")
    f.write("\t},\n")
```

This JSON file hasn't been completed yet. That's because you had an outlier in your original data that you removed. But you want to make sure he's part of your mixed reality experience.

## Add the missing player back in the data

In the first module of this *Space Jam: A New Legacy*-inspired learning path, you realized there were some outliers in your data. If you completed this module, you might remember that in [Unit 5: Check for Outliers](/learn/sports-machine-learning/predict-basketball-player-efficiency-ratings/5-check-for-outliers?azure-portal=true) there was an outlier who had a very low value for points and possessions. This was row 35, ID 40. It turns out that was Yosemite Sam!

You want to make sure he's added back into your JSON data so that he can show up in your mixed reality experience. You'll have to write a bit more code.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the rest of the code isn't indented because this doesn't belong in the for loop.

```python
# Write the opening bracket of the Yosemite Sam object to the file.
f.write("\t{\n")

# Write his name, PER (0), and image url, with the data labels, to the file.
f.write("\t\t\"name\": \"Yosemite Sam\",\n")
f.write("\t\t\"per\": \"0\",\n")
f.write("\t\t\"imgUrl\": \"https://sjanlassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/yosemitesam.png\"\n")

# Since he is the last of the Tune Squad, don't include a comma after closing his object.
f.write("\t}\n")

# Write the closing bracket to the JSON object to the file.
f.write("]")

# Close the file.
f.close()
```

Now you should see a JSON file in your Visual Studio Code folder.
