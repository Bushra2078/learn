To make a Mixed Reality projects you will need a few key tools. The two Mixed Reality projects that follow this module in the *Space Jam: A New Legacy* film inspired learning path will use two different frameworks:

- BabylonJS
- Mixed Reality Toolkit

Before we dive into these frameworks, it's good to get an idea of the types of tools that you will need to have installed and ready to use throughout your Mixed Reality adventures.

## BabylonJS tools

BabylonJS, as the name would imply, is a JavaScript Framework, so the tools can be relatively lightweight! The two main tools you will need are:

- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a code editor that is extremely customizable. It is completely open source, meaning you can see what is being worked on, suggest ideas for improvements, report bugs, or even contribute to it!

To download and install it for free on any platform, visit the [Visual Studio Code Site](https://aka.ms/LearnOnVSCode?azure-portal=true).

Visual Studio Code also also a huge marketplace of extensions so that you can create a developer experience that is right for you. If you haven't already, you should install the [CodeTour extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour&azure-portal=true) from the Visual Studio Marketplace. You can find some additional information about this extension on the [open source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/codetour#readme?azure-portal=true).

### GitHub

GitHub is the largest open source community, featuring not only source control for your code, but also support for deploying applications, collaborating on small group projects, and contributing to large open source projects.

All of the *Space Jam: A New Legacy* inspired starter projects are on GitHub. One benefit of GitHub with Visual Studio Code and CodeTour is that they all work together! The CodeTour for the BabylonJS Mixed Reality project is right there in the GitHub repo, and you can clone your GitHub project from right inside Visual Studio Code.

To get started on GitHub, make sure you create an account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com?azure-portal=true). Accounts are free for public *and* private repositories!

## Mixed Reality Toolkit

The Windows 10 SDK and the Mixed Reality Toolkit are powerful tools. With the power of Visual Studio and Unity, you will be able to create a fully-immersive Mixed Reality experience designed for headsets. But don't worry! Unity provides an effective testing environment, so other than a Windows 10 computer, you do not need any other hardware.

### Visual Studio

Not to be confused with Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio is a much larger IDE, Integrated Development Environment. Like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio has a full [marketplace of extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/?azure-portal=true) that can help you get your environment setup for be productive for you.

For this learning path, you only need [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true), which is free. Since the Mixed Reality Toolkit requires Windows 10, you will need to download Visual Studio, and not Visual Studio for Mac.

### Unity

[Unity](https://unity.com/?azure-portal=true) is a platform for creating interactive and real-time content. Unity is one of the top platforms for creating 2D and 3D games, as well as Mixed Reality experiences. With a tight integration to Visual Studio, you will be able to stay in Unity for most of your Mixed Reality building and open Visual Studio to the exact script you need to edit to make your environment interactive.

If you're working through this learning path and looking to try Unity out, you can download the [free Personal-use edition](https://store.unity.com/download-nuo?azure-portal=true). If you want to learn more about Unity, they have tutorials and sample games on their download site for you to try.
