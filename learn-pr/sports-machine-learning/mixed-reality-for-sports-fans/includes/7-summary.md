This has been a brief intro into the world of Mixed Reality and how we can use it to make a Tune Squad fan's experience a bit more engaging as they explore the stats of their favorite characters.

In the next two modules of this learning path, you will get a chance to try these out and actually make two different versions of the Mixed Reality experience!

> [!TIP]
> This module is part of a multi-modal learning experience. [Follow along with a video walk-through of the module in a new tab](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/Basketball/Video4?azure-portal=true).
