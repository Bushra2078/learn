We are ready to build out the `createCharacterButtons` function. There is a `mainManager` which we will add the `CylinderPanel` to which will be the container for the buttons.

## Create a character panel

Then create the `meshManager` and `meshPanel` to display the pop-up `displayStatsContainer` button. Add the `onPointerUpObservable` click event to remove the `displayStatsContainer` from the scene when clicked.

This function belongs in the   `environment.ts` file within the `Environment` class:

```javascript
public createCharacterButtons() {
    // Create the main 3D UI manager for the button grid
    var mainManager = new GUI.GUI3DManager(this._scene);

    // Create a cylindrical panel so that the images wrap around the user
    var mainButtonPanel = new GUI.CylinderPanel();
    mainButtonPanel.margin = 0.2;
    mainManager.addControl(mainButtonPanel);

    // Create an anchor so that the mainButtonPanel doesn't move
    var anchor = new TransformNode("");
    mainButtonPanel.linkToTransformNode(anchor);
    mainButtonPanel.position =  new Vector3(0,-2,-3);

    // Create 8 columns and 2 rows so that each of the 16 players can be displayed
    mainButtonPanel.columns = 8;
    mainButtonPanel.rows = 2;

    // Set panel layouts
    mainButtonPanel.blockLayout = true;
}
```

Now you have a position for each of the player cards within the main panel.

## Create the character popUp

Now you need add the code for the popUp image that contains the PER value of the player. So when a player is clicked, their stat card (name, image, and PER) will appear large in the center of the screen.

This code belongs at the bottom of the `createCharacterButtons()` function that you started above.

```javascript
// Create the mesh 3D UI manager for the popUp when a user clicks on a player
var meshManager = new GUI.GUI3DManager(this._scene);
var meshPanel = new GUI.PlanePanel();
meshPanel.margin = 0.2;

// Add the meshPanel to the meshManager and anchor it
meshManager.addControl(meshPanel);
meshPanel.linkToTransformNode(anchor);
meshPanel.position = new Vector3(6, 0, -1);

// Set player container and add to mesh panel
var displayStatsContainer = new GUI.HolographicButton("orientation");
meshPanel.addControl(displayStatsContainer);
displayStatsContainer.isVisible = false;
```

This character popUp has the `visible` property set to `false` so that it's not showing initially. The last part is making these character icons interactable!
