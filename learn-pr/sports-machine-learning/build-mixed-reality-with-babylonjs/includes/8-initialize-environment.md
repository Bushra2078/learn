The last thing you need to do before your custom experience is ready for game time is to initialize the environment and replace the default environment in the `index.ts` file. But before you do that, you might want to add in some additional 2D imagery!

## Add the *Space Jam: A New Legacy* logo

Sometimes you need to add 2d text and images. To add these types of objects to the scene use the `AdvancedDynamicTexture`. This allows to add other `GUI` controls. Add the `GUI.Rectangle` to create the `imageRect` and add that to the `guiMenu` dynamic texture. Then we will get the image using the `GUI.Image`, set the image properties and add it to the `imageRect`.

This function belongs in the `Environment` class found in the `environment.ts` file:

```javascript
public addLogo() {
    // Create a GUI that will be full-screen
    const guiMenu = GUI.AdvancedDynamicTexture.CreateFullscreenUI("UI");
    guiMenu.idealHeight = 720;

    // Create a rectangle that the image will be added to
    const imageRect = new GUI.Rectangle("titleContainer");
    imageRect.thickness = 0;

    // Add the image rectangle to the GUI
    guiMenu.addControl(imageRect);

    // Create the logo with an image
    const logo = new GUI.Image("", "https://sjanlassets.blob.core.windows.net/assets/SpaceJamANewLegacyLogo.png")

    // Specify the height and width of the photo
    logo.width = 0.1;
    logo.height = 0.2;

    // Align the logo to the top and center of the GUI, which is the top and center of the screen
    logo.verticalAlignment = GUI.Control.VERTICAL_ALIGNMENT_TOP;
    logo.horizontalAlignment = GUI.Control.HORIZONTAL_ALIGNMENT_CENTER;

    // Add the logo to the image rectangle
    imageRect.addControl(logo);
}
```

Now the Tune Squad fans will know that this XR experience features the epic Tune Squad from the *Space Jam: A New Legacy* film!

## Initialize your custom environment

Now that we have created the functions we will add an `init()` function to call our helper functions that will create the character buttons and include the logo we just added.

This function should go in the `Environment` class in the `environment.ts` file. Typically `init()` functions are added just after the `constructor()`:

```javascript
    public async init() {
        this.createCharacterButtons();
        this.addLogo();
    }

```

Now you're ready to exchange the default environment for the one you just created!

## Initialize the custom environment and test

Back in the `index.ts` file, create a new `Environment`, passing in the `scene` and `engine` we created earlier to construct the class. Then, call `init` to setup the buttons.

```javascript
  const environment = new Environment(scene, engine);
  environment.init();
```

We now have our scene created with the buttons to display the `PER` score for each character!

Lets run  `npm start` and take a look at our scene. To view on a headset you can deploy to a static website or use blob storage for static sites.

This is what the final scene should look like:
