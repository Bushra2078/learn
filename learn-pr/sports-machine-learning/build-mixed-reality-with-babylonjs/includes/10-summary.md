Congratulations! You've now created a WebXR app by using Babylon.js. You can apply these same concepts to create many different Mixed Reality experiences with Babylon.js that can be run cross-platform. What will you dream up next?

Be sure to continue your learning with the other modules in this learning path, and check out the [Babylon.js documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com/?azure-portal=true).

And don't forget to watch [_Space Jam: A New Legacy_](https://spacejam.com?azure-portal=true), coming to theaters July 16!
