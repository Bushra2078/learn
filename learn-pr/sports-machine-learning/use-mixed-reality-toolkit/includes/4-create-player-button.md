The Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) is equipped with 18 button prefabs that you can add to your mixed reality project. Although the button prefabs are configured with components such as scripts, you can further customize the prefabs to meet your specific needs. Furthermore, you can use the existing prefabs to create your own prefabs.

For this project, you'll create a button prefab that contains the following:

- A button that displays the player's name and photo.
- A card that appears when the button is pressed that displays the player's name and stats.

All button objects are created as the children of an empty `GameObject`. Consider this parent object as a container for all button objects. This structure provides organization for your prefab.

Now you'll use scripts provided by MRTK to create a button from scratch that displays the player's name and photo.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure that the objects you'll create don't conflict with the project scripts, name all objects as written in this module.

## Create a container for the prefab

1. In the **Hierarchy** window, select the **+** icon, and select **Create Empty**.

    ![Screenshot of the hierarchy window. The plus icon and Create Empty menu item are highlighted.](../media/create-empty.png)

1. In **Hierarchy**, select the **GameObject**. You see the **GameObject** properties in the **Inspector** window. In **Inspector**, rename the object **PlayerContainer**.

    ![Screenshot of the PlayerContainer object highlighted.](../media/player-container.png)

1. In the **Inspector** window, select the triple dots to the right of the **Transform** component. Then select **Reset**. This resets the position of the container to 0, 0, 0. (This position is considered to be the origin, or the middle of your head if you're wearing a headset.) Because the button objects will be created as children of `PlayerContainer`, the child objects position will be relative to the `PlayerContainer` position.

Now that you have an area for all of your players to go, you need to create buttons for each of them. Unity provides primitives that you can use in your projects as placeholders and prototypes for testing purposes. For this project, you'll use a cube primitive, and then add MRTK scripts to make the cube primitives clickable.

## Create the cube primitive

The cube primitive will be a 3D object onto which you put a character's image, name, and PER score. Then you make that cube interactive.

To create the cube primitive, follow these steps:

1. In the **Hierarchy** window, right-click the **PlayerContainer** object and select **3D Object** > **Cube**. Ensure that the cube is created as a child of the **PlayerContainer** object.

    ![Screenshot of the cube object as a child of player roster.](../media/add-cube.png)

    Notice that the cube is only visible in the **Scene** window, not the **Game** window. The **Game** window is a representation of what you would see if you were wearing or using a device. Currently, the cube's position is at origin, which is why it's not visible in the **Game** window. Furthermore, the cube is 1 meter on all sides, which is a relatively large size for the **Game** window. You'll later change the cube's distance and size.

1. Select the **Cube** in the **Hierarchy** window. You see the cube properties in the **Inspector** window. In **Inspector**, rename the cube **PlayerButton**.

1. In **Inspector**, change the **PlayerButton** **Position** to **0, 0, 0.9**. The Z-axis value controls the distance (or depth) of the object from your view. This setting positions the cube to a distance of 0.9 meters in front of you.

    ![Screenshot of the inspector window for the player button object. The position property is highlighted.](../media/playerbutton-position.png)

1. Change the **Scale** to **.25, .25, .25**. This changes the scale of the cube to .5 meters on each axis.

    ![Screenshot of the inspector window for the player button object. The scale property is highlighted.](../media/playerbutton-scale.png)

1. By default, the cube is a solid gray color. MRTK has shaders that you can use to change the cube's color (or material). In the **Project** window, enter **MRTK_Standard_Charcoal** into the search bar. Below the search bar, next to **Search**, select **In Packages**. This enables you to search in the **Packages** folder, which is where the MRTK shaders are located.

    ![Screenshot of the project window. The search bar and m r t k standard transparent charcoal search result are highlighted.](../media/mrtk-standard-charcoal.png)

    Select the **MRTK_Standard_Charcoal** shader, and drag the shader into the **Inspector** window for the **PlayerButton** object. The color of the cube changes to charcoal.

## Add MRTK scripts to create buttons

MRTK has two scripts that are used to turn an object into a button:

- PressableButton.cs
- NearInteractionTouchable.cs

The `PressableButton` script contains properties for managing the button press, such as the press distance, return speed, and press events. The `NearInteractionTouchable` script contains properties for managing the touch interaction of the object.

For the button to function, you must add each script as components to the cube.

1. Select the **PlayerButton** object in the **Hierarchy** window. In the **Inspector** window, select **Add Component**.

    ![Screenshot of the inspector window for the player button object. The add component button is highlighted.](../media/add-component.png)

1. In the **Search** window that appears, enter **PressableButton**, and select the **PressableButton** script.

    ![Screenshot of the search screen for adding a component. The search result is the pressable button script.](../media/pressable-button-search.png)

1. Select **Add Component** again, and search for **NearInteractionTouchable**. Select the **NearInteractionTouchable** script to add as a component.

1. It's likely that the **Touchable Collider** bounds and center parameters for the `NearInteractionTouchable` script don't match the **PlayerButton** object's collider size and center. Colliders define the shape of the object for the purpose of physical collisions. In this case, a button press is a collision, because your hand presses (or collides) with the cube.

    To adjust the bounds and center, in the **Touchable Collider** properties, select both **Fix Bounds** and **Fix Center**.

    ![Screenshot of the near interaction touchable properties. The bounds and center properties are highlighted.](../media/near-interaction-touchable-properties.png)

1. For the object to be a button, you must assign the **PlayerButton** object in the **PressableButton** script. Within the **PressableButton** component, drag the **PlayerButton** object to the **Moving Button Visuals** property.
