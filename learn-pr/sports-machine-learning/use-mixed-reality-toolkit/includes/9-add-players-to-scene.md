Now that the **PlayerContainer** object is configured with the appropriate button functionality and UI for a player, you can create the object as a prefab. Once the **PlayerContainer** object is created as a prefab, you can use the object for all players on the Tune Squad.

Rather than duplicate a **PlayerContainer** object for each player, you can create an instance of the object (or instantiate) for each player when the scene starts. This requires script logic that creates (or spawns) a **PlayerContainer** object for all players listed in the **players.json** file. Furthermore, script logic is needed to relate the JSON data to the text and sprite objects within the **PlayerContainer** object. Such scripts have been provided for you in the project folder.

> [!TIP]
> This module uses the [starter project found on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/space-jam-a-new-legacy-mrtk-template?azure-portal=true). If you completed the third module in this *Space Jam: A New Legacy* inspired learning path, you might also have your own players.json file, which you can also use.

## Assign objects to JSON data

For each text and sprite object created in the **PlayerContainer** object, a link must be made to it's corresponding value in the **players.json** file. The **Player.cs** script helps establish the connection.

1. In the **Hierarchy**, select the **PlayerButton** object.

1. In the **Inspector** window, add the **Player.cs** script as a component for the **PlayerButton** object.

1. In the **Inspector** window, assign the following for each property of the **Player (Script)** component:

    - **Player Name**: PlayerName (child of **PlayerButton**)
    - **Card Name**: PlayerName (child of **Background**)
    - **Player PER**: PER (child of **Background**)
    - **Player Img**: PlayerImage (child of **PlayerButton**)
    - **Atlas**: MySprites (in **Assets**)

## Create a prefab

For better project organization, it is best practice to place all your prefabs into a **Prefabs** folder. Once the folder is created, you can drag objects from the **Hierarchy** window into the **Project** window to create a prefab.

1. In the **Project** window, select **Assets** and click the **+** button. Next, select **Folder** and name the folder **Prefabs**.

1. In the **Hierarchy** window, drag the **PlayerContainer** object into the **Prefabs** folder. Once an object is created as a prefab, a blue box icon displays next to the object.

    ![A screenshot of the project window. The player container prefab is highlighted.](../media/player-container-prefab.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Prefabs can be edited by opening the prefab. To open a prefab, double-click the prefab within the **Project** window. Once open, the prefab displays in **Prefab Mode**. Any edits made to the prefab will update for all instances of the prefab within your scene.

1. Delete the **PlayerContainer** object from the scene. Your scene should now only consist of the following objects:

    - Directional Light
    - MixedRealityToolkit
    - MixedRealityPlayspace

## Create the PlayerParent

As mentioned, when the scene starts, a button for each player should be instantiated with the respective player data. To better organize the placement of each button, you can use a MRTK **Object Collection** script. These scripts help lay out an array of objects in predefined three-dimensional shapes. 

For this project, you'll arrange the buttons into a grid using the **GridObjectCollection.cs** script. To use the **GridObjectCollection.cs** script, all objects to be arranged must be children of the same parent. Therefore, each instantiated **PlayerContainer** prefab must be the child of the same parent object. To resolve for this, you can use script logic to create all players as the child of a defined object.

1. In the **Hierarchy**, click the **+** button and select **Create Empty**.

1. Select the **GameObject** in the **Hierarchy** window. In the **Inspector** window, rename the object **PlayerParent**.

1. In the **Inspector** window, click the triple dots to the right of the **Transform** component and select **Reset**. This resets the position of the object to 0, 0, 0.

1. In the **Inspector** window add the **GridObjectCollection.cs** script as a component for the **PlayerParent** object.

1. In the **Inspector** window, change the **GridObjectCollection (Script)** properties to the following:

   - **Layout**: Column Then Row
   - **Num Columns**: 4
   - **Cell Width**: 0.32
   - **Cell Height**: 0.32

    ![A screenshot of the grid object collection properties for the player parent object. The layout, num columns, cell width, and cell height properties are highlighted.](../media/grid-object-collection-properties.png)

1. At the bottom of the **GridObjectCollection (Script)** component, click **Update Collection**.

## Create the PlayerLoader

The final step for this project is to create an object that loads the scene. This object consists of a script that will spawn each **PlayerContainer** prefab into the scene. The script also tells Unity to arrange the instantiated children within the **PlayerParent** object into a grid collection defined by the **PlayerParent** object.

1. In the **Hierarchy**, click the **+** button and select **Create Empty**.

1. Select the **GameObject** in the **Hierarchy** window. In the **Inspector** window, rename the object **PlayerLoader**.

1. In the **Inspector** window, click the triple dots to the right of the **Transform** component and select **Reset**. This resets the position of the object to 0, 0, 0.

1. In the **Inspector** window, change the **ParentLoader** object **Position** to **0, 0, 0.5**.

1. In the **Inspector** window add the **SpawnPlayer** as a component for the **PlayerLoader** object.

1. In the **Inspector** window, assign the following for each property of the **SpawnPlayer** component:

    - **Parent**: PlayerParent
    - **Player Prefab**: PlayerContainer
    - **Collection**: PlayerParent

    ![A screenshot of the spawn player properties for the player loader object.](../media/spawn-player.png)

Now the scene is configured, enter into **Play** mode to test out the app. At start, a button is spawned for each player into a grid.

![A screenshot of the game window which displays a player button object spawned for each player.](../media/spawn-demo.png)

You'll notice that **PlayerParent** object now has a child object for each Tune Squad player.

![A screenshot of the hierarchy window. The player parent object and it's children are highlighted.](../media/player-parent-children.png)

Give the app and try and view the PER for each Tune Squad player:

![The final demo of the app. Porky Pig is first selected to display and close the stats card for the player. Marvin the Martian is selected second to display and close the stats card for the player.](../media/final-demo.gif)

Congratulations! You've created a mixed reality app that displays the Tune Squad player roster and their respective PER stats!
