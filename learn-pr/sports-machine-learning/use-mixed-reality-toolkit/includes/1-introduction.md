Welcome to the Jam! Basketball champion and global icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless Tune Bugs Bunny in the animated and live-action event *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, from director Malcolm D. Lee and an innovative filmmaking team that includes Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.
 
This transformational journey is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in digital space by a rogue AI, LeBron must get them home safely by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny, and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the AI's digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of basketball stars as you've never seen them before. It's Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of LeBron's life that will redefine his bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents, and surprise even "King" James by playing the game their own way.
 
Inspired by the film, this module explores how to create an interactive, mixed reality app that displays each Tune Squad player and their stats. Each player will be represented as a button, which you can press to view the player's stats. You'll use the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) to create buttons for each player. The MRTK is a toolkit used to accelerate cross-platform, mixed reality app development in Unity. Rather than create interactive UX features from scratch, the toolkit provides templates for such assets, referred to as a *prefab*.

You can reuse prefabs in your app. Prefabs store a `GameObject`, complete with all its components, property values, and child `GameObjects` as a reusable asset. And if you ever need to modify the prefab, you can do so in one place, rather than individually for each `GameObject` in your scene.

In this module, you'll create your own button prefab, configured with UI that pulls data from a JSON file. You'll also customize an MRTK button prefab for additional app functionality.
