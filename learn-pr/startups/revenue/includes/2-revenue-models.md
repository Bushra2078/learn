It's important to test your assumptions with customers before spending a lot of time building a product.

The same principle of testing assumptions can, and should, be applied to other parts of your business, including how you select the revenue model that you'll use to generate sales and grow your business.

A revenue model is a strategy for how to assign value to your product or service, how to target customers to buy your product or service, what to charge those customers, and how to deliver the value of your product or service in such a way that yields increasing sales.  In other words, it encompasses all the factors you need to consider when thinking about how your business will generate and scale revenue.

Companies can have more than one revenue model, but generally each product or service has its own revenue model. Your choice of revenue model will affect every aspect of your business, so it's important that you think through the pros and cons of each option, and test your assumptions with customers before locking anything in.

There are many ways in which startups can generate revenue. For the purpose of this module, we're going to disregard traditional brick-and-mortar revenue models such as retail and focus on the 10 most common ones used by tech startups.

## The 10 most common startup revenue models

**Revenue model #1:** Usage

**Description:** Customers pay based on the frequency or volume at which they use or consume your product.

**Ideal for:** Infrastructure businesses that provide services that users can't afford to own but need to access (for example, Azure or Twilio).

**Practical considerations:**

- Requires a large, up-front investment.
- Allows you to offer new users a cheap or free plan, then charge more as their usage increases.
- Requires patient investment because revenues from each customer are tied to the customer's growth rate.
- Often requires providing education and support to ensure customers gain maximum benefit from the service and can access more advanced functionality as they grow.

**Revenue model #2:** Subscription

**Description:** Customers sign up for your product. In return for ongoing use, they pay you a recurring subscription fee (software as a service, or SaaS) which can be annual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly.

**Ideal for:** Software products that customers will use regularly and continue using for an extended period (for example, Microsoft 365 or Adobe Photoshop).

**Practical considerations:**

- Enables you to generate recurring revenues, which provide many benefits.
- Tiered pricing plans enable customers to pay based on the features they need, their volume of usage, or the number of seats required, or the size or type of their organization.
- Allows you to offer new customers a free trial that converts to a paid plan after a set period. This can be a good way of getting customers to start using your product, particularly if they're uncertain about the features, value, or pricing. However, it can also be a distraction if too few users convert.
- Enables you to deliver a *freemium* offering in which users can access basic features for free (usually forever), and unlock premium features by paying (for example, LinkedIn Premium, Strava, or Spotify). You need to ensure that a large enough percentage of users convert to paid plans and that free users can be serviced at very low cost.
- As long as you have a higher new customer sign-up rate than churn (unsubscribe) rate, your company will be growing.
- For relatively inexpensive products, it's common for some customers to keep paying even once they no longer use the product. For higher-priced products, this is less common.

**Revenue model #3:** Direct sales

**Description:** Make sales by directly contacting potential customers (outbound sales) or enabling customers to contact you directly (inbound sales).

**Ideal for:** High-value products or services. Enterprise customers where relationships are crucial, or sales require interaction with multiple decision-makers and influencers over time (like SAP).

**Practical considerations:**

- Generally, requires a sales team with relevant industry knowledge and a deep understanding of your product. These sales reps are usually paid a salary plus commission.
- Generally, not suited to low-price products or services because the cost of maintaining a sales team is too high relative to the average sale price.

**Revenue model #4:** Commission

**Description:** Get paid a commission (either a set fee or a percentage of the transaction value) every time a transaction takes place.

**Ideal for:** Marketplace or platform businesses that connect a buyer with a seller (for example, Airbnb or Upwork).

**Practical considerations:**

- You don't need to own the inventory (as with Airbnb) or employ the workers (as with Upwork).
- For two-sided marketplace businesses, you need to attract both sides of the market before you can deliver value and make any transactions. This is referred to as the *cold start problem* for platforms.  
- Marketplace transactions can drop off via *platform leakage* where buyers and sellers decide to continue working together directly. Marketplaces often work best for one-off transactions (such as hiring a freelancer to do a specific job) or those with a heavy reliance on insurance or safety (such as booking a place to stay on holiday), rather than low-risk, recurring transactions (such as booking a math tutor).

**Revenue model #5:** Transactional

**Description:** Make one-off sales and get paid a set price for each transaction.

**Ideal for:** Physical products that can be purchased online via an e-commerce store (for example, most Shopify stores).

**Practical considerations:**

- Revenue generation is an isolated event and only occurs when the customer makes a purchase, so there's limited scope for recurring revenues. Exceptions: products that are purchased often (such as groceries) or subscription boxes such as Dollar Shave Club or meal delivery services.
- Customers can compare prices easily, so unless you have a highly differentiated offering, prices can be driven down by competition, leading to low margins and a need for high transaction volume.
- You need to actually produce  each product (or deliver, in the case of wholesale), so beyond a certain volume, there's generally limited scope to reduce the cost base significantly.
- A good checkout experience can provide opportunities to upsell by recommending complementary products or to drive repeat purchases by offering a discount code for returning customers.
- Can be associated with high customer acquisition costs because it's difficult to find customer acquisition channels that are profitable.
- Doesn't work well for most high-value purchases because these may require multiple sales touch points and trust developed through relationship-building before the customer is comfortable completing the transaction.  

**Revenue model #6:** Service delivery

**Description:** Deliver a service (in-person or online) and get paid an agreed amount, or a fee based on dollars per unit of time.

**Ideal for:** Consulting, graphic design, web development, educational instruction, or any service that can be delivered to a customer.

**Practical considerations:**

- Generally limited scope for recurring revenues because each customer job is an isolated event.
- Cheap to start and can be profitable, especially if you have a rare skill set or one that would be highly valued by prospective clients.
- Limited scope for passive income, because you stop getting paid when you stop delivering the service.
- Doesn't scale well since there's a time cost associated with every occasion that you deliver the service, and only 24 hours in a day.

**Revenue model #7:** Rental

**Description:** Get paid for renting a physical product to a customer. Can be on a flat fee per-use basis or based on time or distance.

**Ideal for:** Any item that users want to use sporadically, but not enough that it makes sense for them to buy and maintain their own (for example, Lime electric scooter rental). Expensive items or those that require complex maintenance (for example, UberAIR helicopter rental).

**Practical considerations:**

- Can be capital-intensive if you need to purchase the assets up-front and generate rental income over time.
- It's essential to make it easy for people to find and use your product, otherwise they'll seek out alternatives.
- Some customers will eventually buy the product themselves (as seen with people renting electric scooters before eventually buying their own).

**Revenue model #8:** Licensing

**Description:** Get paid a license fee for granting another company the right to use your intellectual property (IP) for an agreed purpose.

**Ideal for:** Advanced technologies that could be used by multiple licensees, or in applications where your technology is only part of a solution and relies on an existing product or infrastructure that you don't own (for example, image correction software for use on MRI scanners).

**Practical considerations:**

- Licensees generally make a build-or-buy decision in which they weigh up the cost of creating the technology in-house versus acquiring the right to use your existing technology.
- You generally need to demonstrate the efficacy of your technology in the licensee's setting via a proof-of-concept, demo, or trial.
- It's often important to have IP protection in the form of patents.
- There's a risk that your IP could be copied, particularly if the larger company is willing to risk patent litigation and knows you don't have the financial means to pursue legal action.

**Revenue model #9:** Channel

**Description:** Indirect sales made by third parties that you appoint as agents or resellers.

**Ideal for:** Products or services that naturally sit alongside another company's offering as an up-sell or specialist product (for example, companies that partner with Microsoft via the Microsoft Partner Network).

**Practical considerations:**

- You don't need to build a sales team, although you'll still need a *channel account* person or team to manage the relationships with your channel partners.
- You can take advantage of an existing sales capability and customer base.
- You'll have limited control over the sales process, you don't own the customer relationship, and you may never interact directly with the customer.
- You may not have access to customer data or metrics unless explicitly agreed in the channel agreement.
- Resellers have many different sales incentive structures, and it may be challenging to ensure that your channel partners are sufficiently motivated to promote your product or service alongside others they offer.

**Revenue model #10:** Advertising

**Description:** Sell advertising space to companies that want to promote their product or service.

**Ideal for:** Websites that attract a large number of visitors.

**Practical considerations:**

- Reliant on huge traffic volumes (typically millions of visitors per month) due to the low clickthrough rates on most ads.
- Can be viable if you have a niche focus and a homogenous audience with common needs and interests, and if your site is a dominant player in that niche.

**Task:** Select the revenue model that you believe makes most sense for your startup. Write a list of pros and cons for how this revenue model would work in your startup. Ask yourself what assumptions need to hold true for this revenue model to work, and consider how you can test those assumptions with customers, either through customer interviews or by running experiments.
