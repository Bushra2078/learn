Our goal was to cover 10 of the most common revenue models for companies and provide some guidance on how to identify one that makes sense for your startup.

We also discussed the importance of testing revenue model assumptions with customers and developing a customer persona that represents your ideal first users who are willing to be early adopters.

Finally, we covered some ideas for finding and converting early customers, including practical tips for founders who don't have a strong sales background.
