Our goal was to cover 10 of the most common revenue models for companies and provide guidance on how to identify one that's appropriate for your startup.

We also discussed the importance of testing revenue model assumptions with customers. We discussed the practice of developing a customer persona that represents your ideal first users who are willing to be early adopters.

Finally, we covered some ideas for finding and converting early customers. We included practical tips for founders who don't have a strong sales background.
