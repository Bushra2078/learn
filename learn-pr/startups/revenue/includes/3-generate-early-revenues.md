Once you've validated your core business model assumptions with customers, built a product (or at least an MVP that can be monetized), and selected a revenue model, you should be in a position to start generating revenues.

At this point you should ask yourself a crucial question: Who should I try to sell my product to? (Bearing in mind that your customer may not be the same person as your user, especially if your startup is B2B).  

## Focus on user happiness

A thought experiment: Think about all possible users for your product and imagine their likely level of satisfaction with your product on a continuum.

At one end of this continuum are users who find the product just useful enough that they're willing to use it and pay for it. It may not be exactly what they need, but because it goes some way towards solving a problem for them, they can see value in it. We can think of this group as your *good enough customer*.

At the other end of the continuum are users who derive immense value from your product because it's exactly what they need. It solves a painful problem, does it comprehensively, and delivers value that they haven't been able to unlock in any other way. Once they've started using your product, they can't imagine ever doing without it. We can think of this group as your *ideal first customer*.

It's tempting to take the view that any sale is a good sale, and aim to capture as many customers as possible, spanning the entire continuum. Revenue is revenue, right?

In fact, it's generally best to focus on the ideal first customer – the users for whom your product is an extremely good fit – and make them extremely happy with your product before broadening out your reach to a wider group of users, even if this means making a relatively small number of sales initially.

The benefit of targeting this group of users first is that they'll be evangelists for your product, they'll recommend it to others in their networks, they'll talk about it on social media, and you'll get great reviews and five-star ratings. Your customer lifetime value (LTV) will be high because these customers are sticky and likely to continue using and paying for your product. Going forward, your cost of acquiring new customers will be driven down, since referral is the cheapest form of customer acquisition.

In contrast, by trying to target the entire continuum, you'll inevitably pick up a lot of customers who won't like your product very much. It won't comprehensively solve a problem for them, they won't be advocates for your product, and consequently won't bring other customers via referral. You'll get a range of reviews, some of which will be lukewarm or negative, and you'll have to provide ongoing customer support to a growing number of dissatisfied customers. This will drain resources from your team and could negatively affect team morale.  Worse, it could create a lasting suboptimal impression of your brand at a time when you're still working to complete product development and establish your company as a new entrant in the market.

From a financial perspective, even though you may have generated more upfront revenue, you'll have a lower customer retention rate and therefore a lower customer LTV. Going forward, your cost of customer acquisition will be higher because you not only have to rely on paid channels to reach new customers, but you need to counteract the negative effect of negative reviews by your existing users.

Therefore, a good rule of thumb in the early days of your startup is to focus on selling only to those users who you believe will love your product, rather than trying to sell to a larger number of users who will merely like your product.

Over time, as you refine your product, add more features, and improve the onboarding process, you'll be able to broaden your focus to include users who would have been marginal at the outset.

This approach can be seen in practice by studying successful companies and observing which customer segment they focused on in the beginning, and how they broadened this focus over time.

## Example

Calendly is a great example.  The company started out focusing just on power users who needed to schedule a lot of meetings and were currently relying on sending emails back and forth to find a time that suited both parties. By making scheduling a much simpler task for these users, Calendly became an indispensable tool that saved time and reduced frustration for regular meeting organizers.

Similar to Hotmail, these users regularly included a Calendly link in their emails. By demonstrating their reliance on Calendly, they convinced many new users to try the product, which contributed to Calendly's viral growth.

Over time, Calendly added additional features such as payment gateways for paid consultations, SMS notifications, website embeds, custom branding, and polls for multi-person meetings. In parallel, the company broadened its marketing and customer acquisition efforts to attract a wider group of users, all the time being mindful of the importance of focusing on user happiness.

## Early adopters

Early adopters are those people who are willing to use and pay for your product before anyone else will, even when it's incomplete, buggy, and unstable. It's common to find that early adopters of your product are also early adopters of many other products, because they tend to have an inclination to try new things.

Some other common attributes of early adopters:

- They experience the customer pain more acutely than anyone else.
- They're willing to take the risk of trying and paying for a new and unproven product, and persist even if it's imperfect.
- They relish the opportunity to try new products before anyone else.
- They're happy to give you candid feedback and genuinely want you to succeed.
- They're likely to have experimented with alternatives, including creating makeshift solutions themselves (such as a spreadsheet or a database).

> [!TIP]
> When conducting customer interviews, ask whether the person would be willing to try your product before it launches and give you some feedback. If they say yes, you can tag them as a potential early adopter.

Early adopters aren't the same as ideal target customers, but in many cases, there's a significant overlap between these two groups.

Early adopters are the users who would be willing to try your product before anyone else. Ideal first customers are the people you most want to try your product before anyone else.

By combining the attributes of your ideal first customer and early adopters, it's possible to create a persona that represents the users who are both a good fit for your product (ideal first customers), and who are likely to be receptive to trying it after your initial go-to-market (early adopters).

> [!TIP]
> Time that you've invested in creating an ideal customer persona will help you to define this target user.

There are a few others factors to consider when deciding which users to target first:

- Is this person well known in their sector or recognized as a thought leader? Would their use of your product influence others to do the same?
- Would they be willing to provide a customer testimonial or a short video?
- Do they have a large following on social media?
- If the customer is a business, is it a trusted brand that would confer credibility when listed as a reference customer on your website and in your marketing materials?

## Find and convert early customers

If you've done a reasonable number of customer interviews, it's likely you've built a list of prospects who are interested in your product. Even better, if you've had a landing page live for some time and have run some experiments such as a mock sale, concierge, or Wizard of Oz, then it's possible you already have a substantial mailing list and even some information that can help you categorize prospects based on their propensity to be an ideal first customer or an early adopter.

Some startups are able to grow with zero-touch sales, even in the very early days. However, the vast majority of startups benefit from having the founders engage directly with early customers and close the first 50 to 100 sales in-person.

This approach may seem highly inefficient and manual, but it's in fact highly beneficial. It enables founders to acquire a deep understanding of their customers' needs, while also honing their ability to articulate the value proposition and address any common objections.

Pursuing a direct sales approach at the outset will enable you to describe your company and product on your website and in marketing materials in a way that resonates with your ideal target customer and greatly improves conversions once you start to automate customer acquisition.

If you don't already have a sizeable list of potential customers, there are many ways you can start finding and converting early customers. Some examples:

- Post on Product Hunt and ask everyone you know to upvote your product.
- Join or create a LinkedIn group for people who represent your target customer and post relevant content, respond to questions, establish yourself as a voice of authority, and encourage members to try your product (without spamming the group).
- Post to relevant communities on Reddit or other social networks that make sense for your product and your target audience.
- Talk about your product launch and more generally about the problem space on Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces.
- Experiment with a few different customer acquisition channels (paid ones such as search ads and social ads, and unpaid channels such as social media and content marketing). By tracking uptake data and conversion metrics, you should be able to identify one that works and double down on it.
- Have a short pre-qualification form on your website for potential customers. Ask a few key questions aimed at identifying whether they fit your ideal first customer persona.
- Email or call people you know and ask each to refer you to five people they think could be a potential customer. Give them a discount code that they can pass on to people in their network.
- Go to relevant conferences and exhibitions (in-person or online) and talk to people who are representative of your target customer. Get a speaking spot if you can.
- Talk to every customer who signs up or buys your product to understand how they're using the product and whether they 're satisfied. Your aim should be to learn more about what customers need and at the same time minimize churn. If they love your product, ask them to refer you to people in their network who they think would also benefit from it.
- Incentivize users to share your product with others via an affiliate or referral program.

## Tips for founders without a sales background

It's common for founders who haven't worked in a sales role to struggle with establishing a strong sales ethos and sales processes. This is especially true in B2B companies that need to engage in some form of direct sales  on an ongoing basis.

Often founders who lack sales experience will lean towards hiring someone to take care of sales early in the life of the company. This is generally not a productive strategy. Because founders have a better understanding of the problem and the product than anyone else, they have more passion for the problem than a salaried sales executive, and they're best placed to evangelize their product with customers.

Founders also need to continue learning what customers need, and the best way to do this is by engaging directly with them in a sales context.

Following are some tips  for overcoming a lack of sales experience:

- To make a sale directly with a customer, you have to ask them for money. If you find this an uncomfortable question, you should recognize this as early as possible and address it through sales coaching or discussions with other founders who have a strong sales background and can help you overcome your reluctance.
- Be prepared to hear "no" a lot and be willing to persist with sales calls even if you're getting a low conversion rate. Not closing a sale shouldn't be thought of as a failure, but as an opportunity to learn which types of customers are high-quality versus low-quality prospects, and also how best to articulate your proposition and overcome common objections.
- Learn about sales pipelines and create a basic pipeline using one of the many free or low-cost sales and CRM tools available.
- Automate and document sales processes and gather any required collateral, so that when you do start to build a sales team, those employees can quickly get up to speed and be effective.

## Conclusions

- There are a wide range of revenue models available to startups, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
- Before locking in a revenue model, you should identify any assumptions that need to hold true and test those assumptions with customers.
- In the beginning, it's generally best to focus on the ideal first customer and make them extremely happy with your product, before broadening out to a wider group of users – even if this means making a relatively small number of sales initially.
- By combining the attributes of your ideal first customer and early adopters, it's possible to create a persona that represents the users who are both a good fit for your product (ideal first customers), and who are likely to be receptive to trying it (early adopters).
- Customer interviews and experiments are great ways of building an email list of prospects who are interested in your product and can be targeted with an email campaign when your product launches.
- There are many things you can do to capture your first customers, and it's entirely rational for this to be a manual, time-consuming process at first.
- To expand beyond your early customers, it's essential to develop a strong sales capability within the founding team, put in place sales pipeline tools, and document sales processes.
