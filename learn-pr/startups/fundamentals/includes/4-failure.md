The unfortunate reality is that the majority of startups fail. The good news is that in a lot of cases these common causes of failure are avoidable. As long as founders are aware of the most common startup pitfalls, they may be able to see important warning signs and take steps to mitigate situations before they compound into startup-ending problems.

Bear in mind that failure of your startup doesn't need to spell the end of your entrepreneurial career! Failing can be a great opportunity to learn what customers really want, and if done quickly and cheaply there’s every opportunity for you to pick yourself up and move onto another idea, applying the learnings you’ve had from your first attempt.

In this unit we’re going to focus on understanding the most common causes of startup failure and discuss some of the relatively simple actions you can take (or avoid taking) in the early days to maximize the chances of your startup being successful.

At the end of this unit, we'll work through a checklist that allows you to score your startup against the indicators of startup failure and identify any issues that you might need to address.

## Building a product that nobody wants

By far the most common reason that startups fail is they build products that nobody wants. In reality, nearly every startup can find someone who will use their product. But, as discussed in the previous unit it is essential that you find a both a common problem and one that is sufficiently intense or frequent such that people will actively seek out a solution and pay for it.

Without proven demand from customers, it’s likely that you will build either entirely the wrong product or a product that's not exactly what your target customer needs, and this will prevent you from creating a viable, scalable business.

In module 2 we’ll discuss methods for validating your idea with customers before you spend significant amounts of time or money building your product. This is a vital step to confirm that customers will want your product and that it will solve a real problem for them.

## A derivative idea

Chances are you have encountered startups that are based on a derivative idea. These companies are modelled on successful existing products but tweaked slightly to create something that’s more useful to a narrower set of users or a narrower geography, or that has a slightly different feature set. In some cases, the startup is essentially an alternatively branded version of the original product with no substantive changes.

Some hypothetical examples to illustrate the concept: A social network just for pet owners, a rideshare company that operates in one specific city, or a voice chat product that’s invite-only instead of open to anyone.

Often founders with derivative ideas believe that the market is big enough to accommodate multiple similar competitors. It’s true that startups based on derivative ideas can be successful, especially if the original idea has overlooked a certain segment of users by trying to cater to a very broad audience.

However, in most cases, startups based on derivative ideas have a tough time achieving real scale. It is usually not difficult to acquire some users and generate some revenue, but it is much more difficult to take significant market share from existing companies that already have product-market fit and a recognized brand.

A good example of derivative brands is the recent surge in “mattress-in-a-box” e-commerce companies. These companies produce mattresses, sell them via online stores, and ship them in space-saving rolled-up packaging to customers without establishing a physical retail presence. This is a fundamentally sound business model because it enables the company to have lower overheads and lower prices than traditional retailers, and also provides a more convenient shopping experience for customers.

Casper was one of the first mattress-in-a-box startups. It launched in 2014 and rapidly gained traction in this $28 billion a year market. Over the following few years, more than a dozen mattress-in-a-box companies appeared, with varying degrees of differentiation against the original Casper business model. For more information, see [Mattress Startups: Do We Need Innovation in The Industry?](https://www.fundz.net/blog/mattress-startups-do-we-need-innovation-in-the-industry) and [Why Did Online Mattress Companies Explode?](https://justinkbrady.com/online-mattress-companies/).

The mattress market is large enough to accommodate multiple competitors, and it is true that a number of the mattress startups that followed Casper have been successful due to new product innovations. However, there is a diminishing returns problem with derivative ideas. Being one of the first few entrants in a new business category can be great but being the 10th or 20th of these companies is pretty tough.

Remember in the previous unit we discussed the importance of technology tailwinds? It turns out that mattress-in-a-box startups all leveraged one crucial technology tailwind – namely the recent development of “roll-pack” machines which enable mattresses to be produced and packed down into a small, easily transportable package. Without this new capability none of these mattress-in-a-box startups would have been viable!

## Competing with free

Let’s say you're going to create a product that allows people to do a certain task, and they are currently able to do that task by using something that's free and readily available, like a spreadsheet or a Facebook group.

In these instances you will need to give potential users a compelling reason to use your product, since:

1. You’re asking them to stop using something that they’re familiar with and that currently works for them, even if it’s imperfect;
1. You’re asking them to try something new and learn how to use it; and
1. You’re asking them to pay money for something that was previously free.

If you're competing with free, a good rule of thumb is that your product needs to be 10 times better than the free alternative. It’s only by providing a massively improved experience that people will change their behavior.

**Ask yourself:** How imperfect is the free solution that my target users are currently using? Can I greatly improve the way in which they complete the task? How can I make my product as simple as possible to learn and use? Are users more likely to use my product if I offer a free trial?

## Attempting to scale before achieving problem-solution fit

It can be extremely tempting for startup founders to double down on a product as soon as it acquires its first few customers or generates the first few dollars of revenue.

However, attempting to scale a company based on a relatively weak signal from a small number of users is a risky strategy. Not only is there a risk that these users are exceptional and do not represent the larger cohort of future users, but there is also a possibility that other closely related products could serve a much larger adjacent market, but you just haven’t identified that adjacent opportunity yet.

A helpful way to think about the early days of your startup is to adopt Steve Blank’s definition:

[“A startup is a temporary organization that's designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.”](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything)

A business model is a high-level plan for how the company will create, deliver, and capture value. It includes consideration of the customer, the value proposition, product or service, revenue streams, channels, activities, resources, partners and costs. For a great primer on business models, see [The Business Model Canvas](https://www.businessmodelsinc.com/about-bmi/tools/business-model-canvas/) by Business Models Inc.

Although it seems counter-intuitive, startup founders should set out to not build a business initially and should resist the temptation to acquire users and make revenues. Instead, they should set out on a mission to search for a really good problem to solve, that’s experienced by a large number of people, for which they could build a compelling solution, and around which they can build a scalable business model.

Achieving “problem-solution fit” is at the heart of this. You’ll know you have achieved problem-solution fit when customers tell you unequivocally that they care about the job your product can do for them, and that it would either alleviate a major pain point or create a significant gain for them.

Only when you have this evidence should you stop searching for the right business model and start executing on building your business.

When you're building a startup you are by definition engaging in business model innovation. You're trying a business model   that no one else has tried before, so it would be unreasonable to expect that from the very beginning you know with certainty who your customers are, what product you should build for them, or how you're going to make money.
  
It's therefore helpful to think about the early stages of your startup as an opportunity to explore and experiment. Instead of locking in a plan, you should develop your ideas iteratively over a period of time, engaging with customers to inform your direction and ensure you’re building a product they want and around which you can build a successful business. We’ll spend more time discussing how to validate your idea with customers in Module 2.

## Unnecessary secrecy

Many first-time founders are concerned that someone will steal their idea and use it to build a competing business. This fear leads to either keeping the idea a secret or asking people to sign a non-disclosure agreement before talking to them. Neither of these approaches is helpful for most startups.

The reality is that it’s extremely rare for someone to copy another person’s startup idea. In fact, in most cases the best thing you can do is tell everyone about your startup idea to get as much feedback as possible, especially from potential customers.

The real value in your startup comes from the execution of your idea. It relies on your unique combination of skills and insights coming together to create the best possible solution to the problem you’re trying to solve.

There are plenty of reasons why it’s generally better to tell people what you’re working on rather than keep it a secret. Let’s briefly discuss a few.

1. Ideas are cheap and easy to come up with. Millions of people in the world have startup ideas. Most of those ideas will prove not to be worthwhile. If you ask anyone who’s even remotely interested in being an entrepreneur, chances are they already have multiple startup ideas that they’re passionate about pursuing. Why would they want to devote years of their life working on something they didn’t come up with, and that they’re most likely not passionate about?
1. The longer you keep your idea to yourself the more you’re depriving yourself of valuable feedback. You should take every opportunity to tell people about your idea and find out if it meets a need. Don’t just tell your friends or family, as they’ll most likely give you well-meaning (but unhelpful) positive feedback. The best feedback comes from potential customers, followed by experienced founders, mentors, and investors who can share their advice and insights.
1. Talking about your startup idea is a great way to attract co-founders and collaborators, particularly if you’re part of an existing startup community and can take part in networking opportunities and pitch events. By sharing your vision and passion you’re more likely to find others who can join you and contribute to your startup journey.
1. If you want to raise money from investors, you have to be able to talk openly about what you're working on. Good investors are highly protective of their reputations and there is no sense in an investor stealing your idea. They have better things to do with their time, and the feedback you will get from good investors more than outweighs any risk there might be in talking to them about your idea.

   Very few investors will sign a non-disclosure agreement before you tell them about your startup and asking them to sign one generally doesn’t go over well.

**Note:** If you intend to file a patent application to protect your idea, then publicly disclosing it before you file can jeopardize your ability to get a patent. If patent protection is relevant to your startup, then it’s a good idea to get advice from a patent attorney before disclosing anything publicly.

## Not seeking out the right advice

One of the best things you can do in the early days of your startup is to seek out advice from people with deep startup experience – including experienced founders, angel or venture capital investors, and people who've run startup incubators and accelerators.

These folks may be able to provide advice that will shorten your learning curve, make useful connections and introductions, and prevent you from wasting time and money going down the wrong path.

Their advice is almost always going to be more valuable than the advice you’ll receive from another first-time founder, your accountant (unless they specialize in startups), or your friend who works in a corporate job and has never founded a startup.

One of the reasons first-time founders fail to get advice from the right people is they assume that successful founders and investors are hard to pin down and unlikely to give you their time. Successful founders are certainly busy but many of them have benefited from the guidance of experienced founders who’ve come before them. Startup ecosystems have a strong pay-it-forward ethos, and you might be surprised at how easily you can tap into the experience of some very successful founders simply by asking good questions.

Similarly, investors are always on the lookout for promising startups. Good investors will generally take a meeting with a pre-launch startup founder as long as they can see that you’re working on something that fits their investment mandate and you’re seeking their advice, not just pitching them. As the old adage goes, “If you want money, ask for advice; If you want advice, ask for money”.

**Task:** Make a wish-list of people you’d like to connect with. Start with your local startup community, but also look further afield (the world is a pretty flat place these days). Reach out through mutual contacts, using LinkedIn or by sending a cold email or direct message. Have a specific question that you want to input on that you believe that individual is well-positioned to address; nobody likes to hear “I just want to pick your brains”!

## Co-founder conflict

Disagreement among co-founders is unfortunately a common cause of startup failure.

Disagreements by themselves are a normal part of building a business. However, it’s important that co-founders have a sufficiently robust relationship, and the right processes in place, that they can discuss difficult issues and reach agreement without causing irreparable harm to their working relationships and to the company. q

Co-founder conflict can be particularly acute if the founders have not worked together before, if they have different levels of commitment to the company (both time and financial), they have different financial needs, or if there is a lack of clarity about the respective roles that each will play in the business.

**Ask yourself:** Do the co-founders know each other sufficiently well? Have they developed an ability to work through difficult discussions and reach agreement? Is there any misalignment of interests? If you haven’t already, review the Founder Alignment Worksheet discussed in Unit 1.1 and use it as an input to this process.

### Worksheet

In this unit we’ve discussed seven factors that can be early indicators of eventual startup failure. These are only indicators, and of course they don’t mean that your startup is definitely going to fail. Nor are they an exhaustive list of all the things that can go wrong in your startup! However, they are a good starting point for identifying some of the most common mistakes made in early-stage startups.

Complete the checklist below to score your startup against these six indicators. The ideal outcome is to get as low a score as possible. If you get zero that's fantastic, but don't be concerned if you answer “yes” to some. By completing the remaining modules in the Founders Hub you’ll have an opportunity to explore ways to “un-fail” your startup by addressing any issues that you've identified.

- I may be building a product that nobody wants
- My idea seems like a derivative idea
- I‘m going to be competing with free
- I’ve been attempting to scale before achieving problem-solution fit
- I’m too concerned about secrecy
- I haven’t been seeking out the right advice
- My cofounder(s) and I haven’t addressed how to manage disagreements

Score: __ / 7

Finally, bear in mind that as well as these indicators of failure you should be thinking about the attributes of successful startups, as discussed in the previous unit. The absence of those positive attributes is just as much a concern as the presence of these six indicators of failure.

## Conclusions

- It’s important to consider the motivations and risk tolerance of each co-founder early in the journey. This will help you to ensure you have an informed view of what’s ahead and can address any misalignment of expectations before they become problematic.
- There are a lot of things you can do to validate your startup idea prior to committing full-time. Your objective should be to de-risk the opportunity as much as possible and to make commitments of time and money in step with this de-risking process.
- Your most important job early on is to find a repeatable, scalable business model. You should resist the temptation to try and acquire users or generate revenue until you have strong evidence that your idea addresses a real pain point, you have a clear understanding of the needs of your target users and you know what product they need you to build.
- Successful startups have a number of important shared attributes. By understanding these you can integrate them into your startup from the very beginning.
- A lot of startups fail because the founders make predictable and avoidable mistakes. By understanding some of the most common startup pitfalls, you will be able to avoid them and improve your startup’s chances of success.
