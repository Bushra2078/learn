In this module, we're going to focus on startup basics so that you have a solid guide to lead you on your journey with Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub.

We'll start by discussing some personal considerations – what is it really like to found a startup? (Not the hype, but the nuts and bolts of the journey and what to expect); how to manage your time and energy; and when is the right time to transition to building your business full-time.

We'll also discuss what makes a startup successful, why having a business model that is repeatable and scalable is essential, as well as cover some of the most common reasons that startups fail – so you can avoid making these mistakes.

Finally, we're going to talk about what founders should focus on in the first year of managing their startup so you can map out the next few steps you'll take in your own journey.
