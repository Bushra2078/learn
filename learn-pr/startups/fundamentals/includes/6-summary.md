This module provides you with:

- A short introduction to some core startup concepts.
- A discussion of some personal considerations to help you make decisions about how to allocate your time and effort.
- An examination of some of the attributes of successful and unsuccessful companies.

We worked through a founder alignment exercise to make sure you and your cofounders are on the same page. You also now have two checklists that will hopefully prove useful to you. One checklist helps you identify attributes of successful startups and integrate these into your company. The other checklist helps you identify indicators of failure and avoid making mistakes that could cause your company to fail.
