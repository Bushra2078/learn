This module provides you with:

- A short introduction to some core startup concepts.
- A discussion of some personal considerations to help you make decisions about how to allocate your time and effort.
- An examination of some of the attributes of successful and unsuccessful companies.

We worked through a founder alignment exercise to make sure you and your cofounders are on the same page. You also now have two checklists that will hopefully prove useful to you. One checklist helps you identify attributes of successful startups and integrate these into your company. The other checklist helps you identify indicators of failure and avoid making mistakes that could cause your company to fail.

The following is a short list of conclusions you can draw from this module:

- It's important to consider the motivations and risk tolerance of each cofounder early in the journey. This helps to give you an informed view of what's ahead, and provides an opportunity to address any misalignment of expectations before they become problematic.
- There are a lot of things you can do to validate your startup idea prior to committing full-time. Your objective should be to de-risk the opportunity as much as possible, and to make commitments of time and money in step with this de-risking process.
- Your most important job early on is to find a repeatable, scalable business model. You should resist the temptation to try and acquire users or generate revenue until you have strong evidence that your idea addresses a real pain point. You must have a clear understanding of the needs of your target users, and what product they need you to build.
- Successful startups have a number of important shared attributes. By understanding these you can integrate them into your startup from the very beginning.
- A lot of startups fail because the founders make predictable and avoidable mistakes. By understanding some of the most common startup pitfalls, you'll be able to avoid them and improve your startup's chances of success.
