Our goal was to give you a short introduction to some core startup concepts, discuss some personal considerations to help you make decisions about how to allocate your time and effort, and to cover some of the attributes of successful and unsuccessful companies.

We worked through a founder alignment exercise to make sure you and your cofounders are on the same page, a checklist to help you identify attributes of successful startups and bake these into your company, and a checklist to help you identify indicators of failure and avoid making mistakes that could cause your company to fail.
