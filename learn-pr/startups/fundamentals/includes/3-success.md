Successful startups share a number of important attributes. In this unit we are going to cover some of the most common shared attributes of successful startups and give you an opportunity to score your start up against them.

By understanding what makes startups succeed you will be able to bake some of these attributes into your startup from the very beginning.

## Non-obvious idea

Every startup needs to be based on a good idea. Unfortunately for a lot of founders, the idea they decide to work on is self-evidently good. This means that a lot of other people are likely to have had the same idea, and the company will therefore most likely be competing with other startups, or even large enterprises, doing something similar.

Some of the best startup ideas sound crazy at first but are actually a good idea. This makes them a *great* startup idea, because not many people are working on the same thing.

Let’s consider a Venn diagram.

:::image type="content" source="../media/learning-path-basic-venn-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows two slightly overlapping circles, one for good ideas, and the other for crazy-sounding ideas.":::

The blue set on the left represents all ideas that sound crazy. When you first describe these ideas to people the most common reaction is “That wouldn't work”.

The green set on the right represents all ideas that are in fact a good idea (i.e., they could be the basis for a product that customers want and would pay for).

Not many people start off with ideas that sound crazy and are *in fact* crazy (the blue set on the left, excluding the intersect). That's good news, because the world doesn’t need any more perpetual-motion-machine inventors.

However, a lot of people tend to come up with ideas that are perfectly good but are so obvious (the green set on the right, excluding the intersect) that many startups tend to be working on a similar idea.

Keep in mind that it’s fine to have some competitors because this validates that the opportunity exists and that there are customers who are looking for this solution. However, having a lot of direct competitors is a tough starting point for any startup, particularly if those competitors are further along in their product development and have significant capital to maintain their market lead.

Some of the best startup ideas exist in the intersect between these two sets. They are both a good idea (the green set) and non-obvious (the blue set). These startup ideas are counterintuitive to most people and are only visible to those with deep insights into the problem space, often acquired over long periods of “marinating”, as discussed in the previous unit.

If most people think your startup idea won’t work, but you have some unique insight that convinces you that they’re wrong and you’re right, then you could be onto something.

### Case study: Airbnb

When Airbnb started, a lot of smart people looked at the idea and said: “There is no way people will give their house keys to a stranger and let them stay in their house just to make a few extra bucks. It won't work, at least not at scale.”

Of course, today we know that Airbnb is a wildly successful tech company. The unique insights of the founders gave them the ability to see past this objection and pursue a business model that most people thought would not be viable.

### Task

Imagine you’re trying to raise money from a venture capital fund, and you send them your pitch deck. One of the first things they’ll do is consider the competitive landscape and make an assessment as to whether your startup is doing anything new or different to existing competitors.

Now put yourself in the shoes of the analyst at that VC fund. Spend half an hour doing some online research on your company’s problem space and see how many competitors you can find. Don’t just look for direct competitors that are doing the same thing, but also indirect competitors that might provide an alternative solution to the same problem.

Does your startup stand out as doing something new and innovative, or does it appear to be one of a large number of undifferentiated competitors?

## The right team

It’s fine to be a sole founder at the outset, but before long most founders realize that having a team is critical to the success of their company.

The amount of work needed to build and launch a startup is massive, and it has been shown that sole founders struggle to cope with the workload. For more information, see [The 3 Biggest Challenges of Being a Solo Founder](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245132) and [You can't build a billion dollar despicable me organization](https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/sole-founders-are-bad-you-cant-build-a-billion-dollar-despicable-me-startup/).

More than this, startups also need a range of skill sets and perspectives, and just about every founder benefits from the moral support of being part of a team. Having people you trust as thought leadership partners within the team can help you to weather the inevitable emotional ups and downs of establishing a startup and can build the resiliency necessary to get through the most challenging periods. Moreover, these individuals can provide different approaches to problem-solving that will ultimately contribute to faster progress.

### Task

Complete the following startup skills checklist to see how your team stacks up. There’s no absolutely right mix of skills, but if you find there’s an obvious gap now is a good time to start working on filling it.

- More than one founder
- Diverse backgrounds and perspectives
- Domain expertise relevant to the target market
- Tech skills suited to building the product
- Design skills
- Sales skills
- Communication skills
- Leadership skills

## Intense customer pain

You may have heard of “painkiller” companies versus “vitamin” companies. Painkillers are the ones that are solving a significant pain for customers, whereas “vitamin” companies are making products that might be useful but are more of a “nice to have” than a “need to have”.

The benefit of being a painkiller company is that your target customers are probably looking for a solution to whatever problem is causing them the pain. Maybe they’ve tried other products or even invested time and money trying to create their own solution.

A useful way to think of customer pain is with reference to intensity versus frequency. Problems that are intense are more likely to cause customers to actively seek new possible solutions than problems that are mild. Similarly, problems that occur frequently are better motivators than problems that only occur very occasionally.

If you’re looking at a number of customer pain points that you could address, try plotting them on a chart with intensity and frequency on the axes. The problems in the top right (high intensity, high frequency) quadrant are likely to be the best ones to go after.

## Scalable business model

Successful startups tend to be highly scalable, meaning they can grow rapidly and are able to become increasingly efficient in terms of resource requirements as they deliver their product to an expanding customer base.

If your business model relies on having to perform repetitive, non-scalable tasks (even doing in-person sales calls), you may face major barriers to scalability and growth as these constraints may place an upper limit on the number of customers you can serve.

The following simple graph illustrates a non-scalable company that’s delivering services to customers. Let’s say it’s a graphic design business. As the company gets more customers it does more graphic design work and generates more revenue. But at the same time, it needs to employ more graphic designers, so its costs increase proportionally. At some point it stops growing and its revenues and costs plateau. As long as revenues exceed costs the business is making a profit, which is of course a good thing - but this is not what scalability looks like.

Now let’s look at a scalable business model.

:::image type="content" source="../media/learning-path-scalable.png" alt-text="Graph that shows revenues exceeding costs and sharply increasing.":::

In a scalable company, at some point revenues become decoupled from costs. For a lot of companies this is because they're leveraging the inherent scalability of the internet.

If your product is software, or something that can be achieved through software, once your product is built, the incremental cost of digitally delivering your product to each additional customer is very close to zero.

Once you've built the product and invested in developing and launching it, a scalable business model will enable your company to grow rapidly.

## Large opportunity

The success of a startup is a function of volume and value – “volume” being the number of customers it can serve, and “value” represented by what those customers are willing to pay for the startup’s product or service.  Volume and value in turn dictate the economic rent the company is able to capture and the overarching size of the market the startup could potentially address.

Startup founders should aim to serve as large a market as possible and ensure that their product creates meaningful value for customers.

As noted by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape and co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, “software is eating the world”. Every industry is being disrupted by software companies, resulting in massive shifts of economic value from old ‘legacy’ companies to new ‘digitally-enabled’ ones. There are countless opportunities to build companies capable of disrupting multi-billion-dollar markets, so why create a company that is serving a narrow niche or focused just on a small market?

**Ask yourself:** Am I focused on a large and growing market? Are there enough people who will rely on my product every day to make this an opportunity worth pursuing? Is this a market that’s dominated by large, inefficient incumbents who could be disrupted by my solution?

Remember that you could be devoting the next ten years of your life to this company, so the prize had better be worth the effort!

## Timing

There's an optimal time for every startup idea. You need to ensure you're not launching your startup too far ahead of the opportunity, or too far behind.

An example of launching too far ahead of the opportunity would be a marketplace for the sharing of quantum computing capability. Quantum computing is going to be a huge opportunity at some point. But it may not be wise to set up a marketplace for sharing that capability today; you'd be some years ahead of the curve.

Conversely, you'd be a brave person to start an online bookstore company today. The optimal time for starting that business has passed.

### Task

Make a note of any factors you can think of that effect the timing of your company. Is now a good time for this idea? Why?

## Tailwinds

On a related note, the best ideas often benefit from “tailwinds” that help push them along. These are shifts in technology, consumer behavior, or regulations that make it easier to get your startup started (or that make it possible, if it would previously have been impossible).

Uber benefited from tailwinds when it launched in 2009. The founders had identified a growing acceptance of the sharing economy by consumers, as well as the emergence of ubiquitous GPS and high-quality maps on smartphones (noting that the first iPhone was released in 2007).

Had someone tried to launch a ridesharing app like Uber five years earlier, it wouldn't have made sense. Similarly, if someone was to start another rideshare company today it would work but would face stiff competition from a large number of existing ridesharing apps that have established traction, market share, and a strong brand.

### Task

Make a note of all of the tailwinds you can think of that might benefit your company. What can you do now to capitalize on them?

## Inherently shareable

The cheapest way to acquire a new customer is by having an existing customer refer someone else to your product.

A large proportion of successful startups deliberately built features that make it easy for users to share their product, and this shareability contributed to their massive growth.

Hotmail is a great example. The company started in 1996 and at that time was just about the first browser-based email service. Free browser-based email is ubiquitous and free today, but in 1996, in the early days of the internet, nearly everyone's email address was tied to their ISP. That was inconvenient because if you changed your ISP, then you had to change your email address.

Hotmail decided to make their product shareable by putting a footer at the bottom of every email that read ”Sent from Hotmail. Get your free email here”. The result of this small feature was a lot of people clicked on the link, and a lot of people got a Hotmail address.

Over the course of a year and a half after launching, Hotmail grew from zero users to nine million users, and was subsequently acquired in late 1997 by Microsoft for a reported $450 million. For more information, see:

- [Microsoft Acquires Hotmail](https://news.microsoft.com/1997/12/31/microsoft-acquires-hotmail/)
- [List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft)
- [How Hotmail changed Microsoft (and email) forever](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/12/how-hotmail-changed-microsoft-and-email-forever/)

Today, nine million users doesn't seem like much, since there are billions of people on the internet. But in 1997, this represented around one out of every eight internet users! For more information, see [Internet growth statistics](https://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm).

### Task

1. Make a note of the five software products that you use most often. See if you can find a way that each of them has been deliberately designed to be shareable. Has the company found a way of incentivizing existing users to share it with new users? Do you think this has contributed to the company’s growth?
1. Think about what features can you build into your product from the beginning that will make it easy to share. How can you provide users an incentive to share it?

## Recurring revenues

We’re going to discuss one more shared attribute of successful startups: a business model that enables recurring revenues.

Unlike one-off sales, recurring revenues occur on a regular, ongoing basis. For example, software-as-a-service businesses that bill customers through a subscription agreement generate recurring revenues. With this type of business model, as long as the customer continues using your product and paying for it, you will continue making money.
Recurring revenues are highly attractive because:

- They can lead to a high customer life-time value (LTV)
- The cost of retaining an existing customer is almost always lower than the cost of acquiring a new customer
- Revenues are predictable as long as you have a high level of customer retention
- Predictable revenues enable more confidence in investing in product development, often leading to better products over time
- Companies that generate recurring revenues can be scaled much more rapidly
- Investors are usually more interested in investing businesses that generate recurring revenues than those that make one-off sales, since each new customer is building cumulatively on an existing revenue base
- Customers often prefer to spread the cost of your product over a monthly billing cycle rather than having to pay for it up-front
- You can make money while you sleep!

### Task

Open your smartphone or your laptop. Make a note of all the products that you've subscribed to and that you are continuing to pay for on an ongoing basis.

Ask yourself: Why do I continue to pay for this product? Look at the communications you’ve received from the company to see what they have done to ensure they retain you as a paying customer.

Are there any lessons that you can apply in your own startup?
