As a founder, your personal brand can add significantly to the credibility of your company and help you to engage more effectively with potential customers, investors, partners and the media.

What is a personal brand? It can be viewed as the sum of your professional reputation (what you've done before), what you stand for and what you're an expert at (you right now), and your mission (where you're going in the future).

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has described personal brand as ["what people say about you when you're not in the room"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2016/09/06/the-most-damaging-myth-about-branding/?azure-portal=true).

Having a strong personal brand can be a critical factor in whether others buy into the mission and vision of your company, talk about it with friends and colleagues, recommend it to others, or simply trust you. People are naturally more inclined to trust a business when they can see who owns it and what they're passionate about.

It can also be a major factor in whether the media view you as a competent and noteworthy spokesperson on topics that are relevant to your company. By becoming recognized as a subject matter expert or thought leader in the domain in which your company operates, you'll increase your chances of being approached by journalists for comment or to talk about what your company is doing.

Increased visibility can be thought of as a way of increasing your surface area for luck. It's not always possible to predict what opportunities will come your way, but by being visible and authentic, you can greatly increase the volume of inbound opportunities.

One way to evaluate your personal brand is to do an online search for yourself and see what you find. Imagine someone else is doing the search and they currently know nothing about you. Do they find any information at all? Of what they do find, will it strengthen their trust in you as a person, and by connection, in your company?

You can also do a reverse search by using keywords that describe your core areas of expertise, just as a journalist might search for an expert to interview on a particular topic. When you do the search, does your name appear in the first few results? If not, what could you do to change this?

By the time you're working full-time on your startup, you should expect that a web search for you delivers at least the following results:

- A LinkedIn profile page
- Your biography and photo on the team page of your company website
- Social media accounts
- Photos of you in a business context (as opposed to holiday pictures you've posted on a social site)
- A couple of blog posts on topics relevant to your company or industry
- Links to any talks, webinars, or interviews you've given
- Some media coverage, even if it's in a small publication or contains a brief mention of you and your company as part of a larger article

If you're a startup founder at the beginning of building a company, here are some practical things you can do to establish and grow your personal brand, starting with basic steps that you can take immediately.

## Create a professional LinkedIn profile

LinkedIn is the online business directory used by over 600 million people worldwide. Not having a LinkedIn profile makes you look amateurish, so it's essential that you have one and that it's professional and up to date.

Unless your startup is in stealth mode, your LinkedIn profile should list your role as founder of your company. If you're a full-time founder, this should be the only current professional role listed, and be the first listing.

Besides a professional-looking photo, your profile should include a summary that says something about who you are, what you've done before, and also provide a glimpse into where you're going. Make sure your profile doesn't read like you're looking for a job!

The **About** section of your LinkedIn profile is also a great place to mention the kinds of opportunities you're looking for. People are naturally inclined to try to help, so you might as well make it easy for them. Think about your business objectives. What opportunities do you want more of, and how can you articulate these to make it easy for the right people to connect with you?

## Get some decent photos

It's important to have high-quality photos for LinkedIn, social media accounts, your website, and any other communications that mention you as a founder.

A good photo has the following attributes:

- Current (no more than a couple of years old)
- Friendly and engaging (you're smiling and looking at the camera)
- Confident expression and body language
- High quality (ideally taken with a professional camera and available in high resolution when needed)
- Well lit (not backlit or shadowy, and not in bright sunlight that makes you squint)
- A plain background that's not distracting and doesn't include other people

It's also a good idea to have a variety of photos available for different uses.

## Have your biography on the company web site

Increasingly, website visitors expect to be able to see who's behind the company.

When you list the founders on your web site, make sure you describe why they're the right people to build this business, and importantly, why they felt compelled to solve whatever problem your company is focused on. If you have a personal connection to the problem, this is a great place to talk about it.

What is your most significant strength, and how does that help you to deliver better results for your customers?

Once you've written your biography, send it to a few friends and ask them for feedback. Is it an authentic representation of who you are, and does it instill trust and confidence in you as a business leader?

## Have a presence on social media

You should take the time to create personal social media accounts on whichever platforms are most relevant to your audience. If you're a founder of a B2C company, you might want to focus on Facebook and Instagram. If you have a B2B company, LinkedIn might be a priority.

Make sure to keep this separate from any existing social media accounts that you have for private use.

Take the time to post informative content and do it frequently enough that people can see you really care about engaging with your customers and other stakeholders.

Be authentic rather than posting content that looks like it was created by a social media agency. This is the only way to meaningfully engage on social media these days.

## Write blog posts relevant to your company or industry

Short blog posts are an excellent way of showing that you're genuinely passionate about the domain in which your company operates, and of demonstrating your expertise as a thought leader in your field.

It's a good idea to write blog posts with a *create-once-publish-many-times* philosophy. You might choose to publish the full version of a post on your website, use a snippet of this in your email marketing campaigns or newsletter, and put out a shorter version as a LinkedIn post or on Medium.

By establishing a regular cadence of creating and releasing authentic content, you can rapidly become recognized as a subject matter expert. This won't only strengthen the credibility of your company's brand but can also lead to opportunities such as requests for comment from media outlets and even inbound inquiries from potential recruits, customers, and investors.

## Become a great storyteller

As a startup founder, one of your most important roles is to tell and retell the story of your company. Why does it exist? What important problem are you solving for your customers? What's your vision for the future of the company, and what impact can it have in the world?

By including anecdotes of how you 've helped customers and what benefits they've received from using your product, you can connect with future customers in an authentic way â€“ whether that's in person, online, or in prerecorded videos.

Storytelling is also an important part of delivering investor pitches, and the more you practice telling your story, the better you'll get at engaging your audience and explaining why your company really matters.

## Seek out media opportunities

Broadly speaking, there are two types of media opportunities that startup founders should seek out:

- Opinion pieces in which you comment as a voice of authority on a particular topic. These pieces aren't about your company but may provide an opportunity for a brief mention of your company and what it does.
- Pieces about your company. These tend to be tied to important milestones such as closing a funding round, announcing a notable key hire, or signing an important brand-name customer. Unless you're doing something particularly unusual, it's uncommon for the mainstream media to write about your company simply because it has launched. You may, however, be able to attract the attention of startup-focused media if you can provide an interesting story about why your company exists.

## Get media training if you need it

Not all first-time startup founders have experience in public speaking, and relatively few are experienced in doing media interviews or talking on camera.

These can be daunting skills to learn, and it's not advisable to learn by trial and error. There are many sources of media training, including group and individual coaching on how to perform well in a TV or radio interview, how to talk on camera or simply how to present confidently to an audience.

## Conclusions

- It's easy to pick a suboptimal name for your company. Doing this is unlikely to kill your company, but it can create friction and make it harder for potential customers to find you. It can also affect the credibility of your company's brand.
- The name of your company is one of the few things you're 100 percent in control of, so you might as well get it as close to right as possible.
- If you aspire to be a global company, one of the key intellectual property assets your company should own is the domain *\<your-company-name\>.com*.
- If you decide that you should change your company name, the best time for the change is now. It's never easy, but the longer you wait, the more difficult and expensive it will be.
- All startup founders should invest time in building their personal brand as a business leader and external face of their company.
- Customers, investors, and future employees are seeking authentic communications from companies. Having the founders as the primary spokesperson for the company makes it easier for people to relate.
