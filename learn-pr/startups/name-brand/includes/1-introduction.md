In this module, we're going to focus on naming and branding.

Choosing a great name for your startup is hard. It can seem like all the good names are taken, and registering a domain for your company can feel like an impossible task. However, a great name makes it easy for customers to find you, talk about you, and refer other customers. It's also a major factor in how people perceive the credibility of your company.

As a startup founder, the name of your company is one of the few things you're 100 percent in control of, so you might as well get it as close to right as possible.

Unfortunately, a lot of founders pick a suboptimal name for their company. This introduces friction for customers trying to find and talk about the company and makes it harder for the company to build a strong brand. In many cases, it results in the company having to spend time and money later to change its name by doing a complete rebrand.

In this module, we're going to cover how to choose a great name from the beginning, including the importance of tying your brand to a strong web presence in the form of a dot-com domain and relevant social handles.

We're also going to introduce the concept of personal brand for startup founders and discuss some of the ways you can position yourself as a thought leader to help boost the strength of your company's brand.
