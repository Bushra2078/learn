Our goal was to outline some steps you can take to identify a good name for your startup and use this as the foundation for a strong company brand. We used eight startup naming principles as a guide to help you choose a good name for your company. 

We also discussed the importance of building your personal brand as a founder and using this to add credibility to the company's brand and covered some steps you can take to build and strengthen your personal brand.
