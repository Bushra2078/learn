Picking a good name for your company is a subjective exercise, but there are some simple criteria that you can use to help identify potential names.

Good startup names have the following eight attributes:

- Simple
- Memorable
- Easy to spell
- Easy to say
- Safe in other languages
- Future-proof
- The dot-com domain is available
- Doesn't infringe an existing trademark

Let's go through each of these and discuss why they're important.

## Simple

A simple name is one that has as few characters and syllables as possible. The shorter the name, the easier it will be for people to remember, say, and type.

As a guide, you should aim to have no more than three syllables and no more than 10 characters in your company name.

Examples: Uber, Canva, Yammer, GitHub, Bing, Xero, Slack, Stripe

## Memorable

One of the best ways to make your company name memorable is to come up with an invented word.

It's generally best not to use a generic or descriptive term (such as travel, finance, photo, family, pet, store, groceries, movie) because there are likely to be a lot of other companies using the same term in their name. Using generic terms can make it hard for you to stand out, and also can affect your search engine ranking.

The best invented-word names tend to hint at what the company does without trying to describe it in literal terms.

Examples (ordered from the most indirect to most direct hints):

- Trello (variation on trellis, a latticework structure)
- Twitter (short communication, like birds twittering)
- Zoom (fast, seamless video communication)
- Expedia (expeditions + encyclopedia)
- Netflix (internet movies)

## Easy to spell

You should choose a company name that people can spell, so that when they hear about your company, they can find it easily online.

If people have to guess the spelling of your company name, you're introducing unnecessary friction, and some of those users will give up before they find you.

This is an attribute that you can test objectively with another person. Say the name of your company and ask the person to write it down or type it into a search engine. Do this with 10 people and see how many of them correctly spell your company name the first time.

You should expect 9 or preferably 10 out of 10 to get it right the first time. Any less than this, and you should consider finding another name.

## Easy to say

You should choose a company name that's easy to say. There are two parts to this test: can people pronounce it correctly, and does it feel good to say it?

The correct pronunciation of your company name should be obvious, so that when people read it, they can say it and be confident they're pronouncing it correctly. This is important because you want people to talk about your company, and if they're unsure how to pronounce it, they're less likely to say it for fear of sounding ignorant.

This is also an attribute that you can test objectively. Show 10 people the name of your company written down and ask each one to read out the name. You not only want 9 or preferably 10 to get it right the first time, but you should also ask them whether they were in any doubt about how to pronounce it. If you find that some people are unsure how to pronounce your company name, you should probably change it.

Related to this, it's important that the name of your company is a word that you feel good saying, and that seems like a fit for the kind of business you want to build. Over the life of your company, you're going to say the name many thousands of times, so it needs to feel right to you.

Is your company's brand personality going to be conservative (for example, Cisco Systems) or quirky (for example, TikTok)? Think about brand personality not just from your perspective, but from the perspective of your future users.

## Safe in other languages

We've all heard of companies and products that were given a name that turned out to be an insult in another language.

Do some online research to check that your preferred name doesn't translate to something offensive in another language. You might also decide to test similar-sounding words with different spellings, and also check with people who speak the language of each of your main target non-English-speaking markets.

## Future-proof

A common pitfall in choosing company names is to settle on something that's too closely tied to your current product or market.

By naming your company too narrowly, you run the risk that the name will no longer fit if in the future you add other products, pivot away from your current product entirely, or focus on other markets.

For example, Emily is building a product to streamline personal banking. She might decide to use words such as "bank" or "savings" in her company name, but this could be a problem if in the future she decides to launch a product to streamline investment portfolios.

Think about all the adjacent markets you might ultimately focus on. Does your preferred company name give you a reasonable degree of freedom to build other products or enter other markets?

## The dot-com domain is available

If you wanted to start a company called Microsoft today, you wouldn't be able to have the domain microsoft.com (for obvious reasons). Maybe you could use a *domain hack* and try to register microsoft.io, microso.ft, getmicrosoft.com, hellomicrosoft.com, microsoft-app.com or some other variant, but most people would agree that this isn't a good strategy.

Nevertheless, a lot of startup founders compromise the strength of their brand from the outset by choosing a name for which the domain *\<their-company-name\>.com* isn't available, either because someone has registered it and is sitting on it, or (even worse) there's an existing business using that domain.

Instead, they settle for an inferior domain such as *\<their-company-name\>.io* or *.biz*, or they use domain hacks such as the examples cited earlier.

Apart from causing confusion among users and making it harder for them to find your company, this brand compromise signals weakness. As pointed out by Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham, [startups that choose a marginal domain are often viewed as marginal companies](http://paulgraham.com/name.html).

If you're going to be a successful global company, you should have the domain *\<your-company-name\>.com*.

This may seem like something of a hard-line view, but experience suggests that a small investment of time up-front will pay off massively by allowing your company to start with a strong brand, rather than starting with a suboptimal brand and having to change it later.

Not having *\<your-company-name\>.com* is unlikely to kill your company, but it does add friction by forcing potential customers to take extra time to find you online. As your company matures beyond the startup phase, not having the domain *\<your-company-name\>.com* can start to look highly conspicuous.

Perhaps more importantly, the domain *\<your-company-name\>.com* should arguably be one of the key intellectual property assets owned by your business. The more successful your company becomes, the greater the risk you're taking by not owning this asset. While you're a small startup, whoever owns that domain will mostly likely be happy to sit on it. Maybe they'd accept a modest offer to sell it to you.

But let's say in a couple of years from now your company is growing fast, you raise a large funding round, and you get some great media coverage. At that point you're exposed to the possibility that whoever owns *\<your-company-name\>.com* will try to take advantage of the situation and get you to buy it from them at a high price.

So, before you commit to a name for your company, make sure you can have *\<your-company-name\>.com*. If it's available to register, you can do that straight away. In many cases, you'll find that someone has registered the domain and is sitting on it. If so, you'll need to make an offer to buy it. There are a number of domain registrars that offer anonymous brokerage services, such as [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/domains/domain-broker).

There are several other domains you should consider registering at the same time, primarily to prevent opportunists from snapping them up. The main categories are:

- Any common domain extensions that are available, such as *\<your-company-name\>.com*, *.biz*, and *.io*.
- Any potential misspellings of your company name.
- Any likely domain hacks such as get-*\<your-company-name\>.com*.
- The relevant country-specific domain if you're located outside the U.S.

Lastly, if your company will be heavily reliant on one or more social networks to reach users, you should check on the availability of social handles. It could be highly undesirable to pick a company name only to realize later that there are existing social media accounts using that name.

## Doesn't infringe an existing Trademark

A final step before locking in a name for your company is to do a trademark search. A basic [search of US trademarks is free](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search), and can help to give you some confidence that you're not choosing a name that will lead you to an expensive lawsuit in the future.

It's often a good idea to consult with a trademark attorney who can do a more robust search and advise you on any trademark issues.

## Task

Score your company name (or proposed name) out of eight by using this score sheet.

If you score seven or eight, chances are your company name is a reasonable choice. If you score six or less, it might be time to seriously consider changing it.

If you decide that you should change your company name, the best time to do it is now. It's never easy, but the longer you wait, the more difficult and expensive it will be.

Remember that the principles we've discussed in this unit are a guide only, and there are of course companies that have been successful despite breaking one or more of these principles.
