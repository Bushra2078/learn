We've discussed how customer interviews can be a useful way of testing your assumptions. Customer interviews are, in fact, a type of experiment. In this unit, we're going to discuss several other types of experiments that will help you to expand on the insights gleaned from customer interviews.

Experiments range in complexity from simply asking a user to provide their email address to observing them as they interact with your minimum viable product (MVP), or asking them to purchase or pre-purchase your product.

Startup founders can use experiments to test a specific hypothesis by providing an input to the user and measuring the output â€“ usually in the form of user actions.

Each experiment should have at least the following elements:

- **Hypothesis**: A concise, falsifiable statement representing one of your core assumptions
- **Actions**: The steps you'll take to test your hypothesis
- **Data**: What you'll measure or observe in the experiment
- **Success criterion**: The minimum response you need to validate your hypothesis

It's generally a good idea to run multiple experiments to test each of your critical hypotheses. In most cases it's advisable to start with the cheapest, quickest experiments to generate some initial data, even if it's imperfect. If the results of these initial experiments are promising, you can progress to more complex experiments that might take more time and effort to complete, but will give you a greater level of confidence in the strength of your hypotheses.

At the end of every experiment, it's critical that you evaluate what you learned and what decisions you can make based on that information.

The following are examples of commonly used experiments, starting with simple, low-fidelity and moving on to more complex, high-fidelity experiments.

## Experiment type: Online ad

**Description:** Create an online ad (search-based, display ad, or social media ad) based on your proposed value proposition and targeting customers who match your ideal customer persona.

**Purpose:** Test whether your target customer will respond to a call-to-action such as visiting your web site.

**Pros:** Produces a simple-to-track click-through rate and conversion rate, provided you have correctly set up analytics before launching the ad.

**Cons:** Only demonstrates relatively weak interest. Getting a user to select a link may not translate to strong enough interest to use or pay for your product.

**Practical tips:** Search term ads are valuable for testing interest among users who are already aware of the problem and are searching for a solution, while display ads and social media ads are better suited to users who haven't yet reached this point of awareness.

## Experiment type: Landing page

**Description:** A simple web site (usually a single page) that describes your product and value proposition and asks the customer to respond to a call-to-action. This might be a request to provide their email address (weak evidence of interest), complete an online form (stronger evidence), or pre-purchase your product (even stronger).

**Purpose:** Test whether your target customer will respond to a call-to-action.

**Pros:** Is inexpensive to set up and run.

**Cons:** Requires a suitable domain and sufficient design input to ensure that the page looks professional.

**Practical tips:** Ensure your call-to-action is above the fold because not all visitors will scroll through the whole page. You can drive traffic to the site using online ads, email campaigns, social media, posting in relevant online forms, etc. Use quotes from your customer interviews to highlight customer pain points. Ensure you're always up-front about the status of your product.

## Experiment type: Clickable prototype

**Description:** A realistic mock-up of key screens from within your product. Generally implemented using a tool such as Figma, InVision, or Microsoft Visio.

**Purpose:** Allows you to observe users interacting with something that resembles your final product and to collect their feedback afterwards.

**Pros:** Can be a great way to find out what features customers get excited about. The length of time a user spends engaging with the prototype can be a good indicator of interest.

**Cons:** Requires design expertise and an investment of time in capturing individual feedback. Requires users to commit a meaningful amount of time to engaging with your prototype.

**Practical tips:** Best delivered in-person with you providing the user with context at the start and inviting their feedback at the end.

## Experiment type: Concierge

**Description:** Deliver an outcome to the customer manually, walking the customer through the steps that will ultimately be automated by your software product. For example, if the outcome is a report that you provide to the customer based on their inputs, you may be able to capture the inputs via a simple form and manually create the report and send it to them.

**Purpose:** By delivering an outcome to the customer, you can test whether they perceive the outcome as valuable. In many cases, this is a more important assumption to test than anything to do with the process by which the outcome is achieved.

**Pros:** Can often be done quickly and cheaply, because you can deliver an outcome without having to build the product. Allows for collection of feedback from the customer after they've received the outcome and derived the value. This can also be an opportunity to make sales as long as customers see sufficient value in the outcome. Walking customers through the process is a good way to test it and ensure you integrate any learnings when you actually begin building the product.

**Cons:** Doesn't scale well, so you'll only be able to deliver an outcome to a limited number of customers. Depending on the complexity of the process, you may need to set expectations so the customer knows when they can expect a response.

**Practical tips:** It's often a good idea to have at least a landing page that customers can visit to start the process of signing up and provide any required inputs. Make sure it's easy for customers to leave written feedback and a testimonial if they found the outcome valuable.

## Experiment type: Wizard of Oz

**Description:** Similar to a Concierge type experiment, with the critical difference that customers are unaware that the process is being completed manually "behind the curtain".

**Purpose:** A Wizard of Oz experiment allows you to test both the perceived value of the outcome and also the process by which you deliver it.

**Pros:** Provides a more robust test of pricing than the Concierge method, because from the customer's perspective, they're buying and using your product.

**Cons:** Generally doesn't scale to a large number of customers because the process is manual. Only suited to products that create a single output for the customer (such as a report or actioning something), but not to products that require significant customer interaction.

**Practical tips:** You need to be prepared to deliver an outcome to the customer quickly, because they're unaware that the behind-the-scenes process is being done manually. It's generally a good idea to price your product so that you can deliver it profitably using Wizard of Oz. If you can do this, there's nothing to stop you continuing to deliver value manually for as long as you like. When you do automate the process, your profit margin can only improve.

## Experiment type: Mock sale

**Description:** In a mock sale experiment, you're positioning your product alongside plans and pricing information, and testing customers' interesting in buying, without actually taking any payment. When customers select a pricing option, you can tell them the product isn't available to purchase yet and ask them to provide their details to be notified when it is.

**Purpose:** A mock sale is ideal for testing whether customers perceive value in your product, because selecting a pricing option signals an intent to purchase. It's also useful for testing different price points or plans.

**Pros:** Can be used before the product is built by placing mockups of screenshots and other information on a landing page. Can be a valuable way to create an email list of strongly interested prospects.

**Cons:** An intent to purchase doesn't always equate to actual purchases when the product is live.

**Practical tips:** Make sure you're not taking payment or giving any misleading information to customers. Track different traffic sources to establish which are most likely to bring paying customers to your site.

## Experiment type: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Description:** A basic functioning software product that delivers the minimum feature set (usually a single feature) to test a core assumption.

**Purpose:** Deliver sufficient value to customers through an MVP to meet a particular customer job, solve a pain point, and enable you to learn about the customer's needs and experience.

**Pros:** Can convert users from a free trial to paying customer. Paying for a single feature is a strong signal of customer interest.

**Cons:** For some startups, a significant effort is required to create an MVP that actually delivers value. In some industries, there may be an unacceptable risk of the MVP failing or not complying with regulatory requirements (for example, healthcare and cybersecurity).

**Practical tips:** Keep the MVP to one feature that best represents the core job that your product needs to do. Focus on attracting users for whom the limited feature set is likely to solve an important problem. Make it easy for users to provide written feedback, and if it's positive, invite them to supply a customer testimonial. It's usually a good idea to create your MVP based on learnings from a lower-fidelity experiment such as customer interviews followed by a Clickable Prototype, Concierge, or Wizard of Oz.

It's easy to think of an MVP as "version 1.0" of your product, but this can easily lead founders to build much more than they need to.

For many products, an MVP is better viewed as a disposable tool that you create solely for the purpose of testing assumptions with customers. It's often possible to build an MVP quickly and cheaply using low-code or no-code tools and still deliver value via a single feature. In these instances, you can throw the MVP away after the experiment is completed and start building your product based on your learnings rather than try to use a rough MVP as the basis for your product.

## Task: Plan an experiment

Select at least one experiment type that makes sense for your startup. Map out the steps you'll take to complete the experiment. Remember to consider what hypothesis you intend to test, and express it as a concise, falsifiable statement. Spell out what you'll measure or observe in the experiment, and the minimum response you need to validate your hypothesis.

## Conclusions

- You're engaging in business model innovation, so don't even think about writing a 50-page business plan.
- The value a product creates for a company's customers can be described with reference to the jobs it helps the customer get done, the pains it takes away, and the gains it creates.
- The Value Proposition Canvas is a useful tool for designing a value proposition by engaging with customers to understand their jobs-to-be-done, pains, and gains, and then creating a product that accurately addresses these.
- The only way to know whether your assumptions are correct is to test them with customers.
- You should prioritize testing your assumptions based on how critical each is to the success of the business and how much you already know. 
- There are many ways of testing your assumptions. Interviewing potential customers is a good place to start. You should aim to run multiple low-fidelity experiments before committing to building your product.
