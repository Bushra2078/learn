So far in this module, we've focused on capturing and prioritizing your assumptions. In the next two units, we're going to focus on testing critical assumptions using customer interviews and experiments.

## Planning and conducting customer interviews

Interviewing customers is a powerful way of getting inside the mind of your target customer. By interviewing, you can test your assumptions before building a product. It's also inexpensive and time efficient.

In order to get the most out of customer interviews, it's important that you construct some well-thought-out questions and avoid falling into some common traps.

### Customer interview best practices

**Do:**

- Ask open questions. For example, "How do you currently manage your finances across multiple bank accounts?"
- Ask for stories. For example, "Can you tell me about the last time you tried to do this? How easy was it? Was there anything you wished you could do more easily?"
- Let them do 80 percent of the talking (that means you do 20 percent of the talking and a lot of listening).
- Reflect back. For example, "OK, so it sounds like you generally export your bank feeds into a spreadsheet and manually combine them. Have I understood that correctly?"
- Have a prepared set of interview questions that you ask every customer.
- Delve into unexpected responses. For example, "That's interesting. Why do you did you decide to do it that way?"
- Ask what other solutions they've tried and what they liked or disliked about them.
- Ask how much time and money they've spent trying to solve the problem.
- Invite them to suggest others you should speak to. This is an efficient way of recruiting more customers to interview.
- Finish each interview with "What else should I have asked you?" in case they have some other insights that weren't elicited by any of your questions.

**Don't:**

- Ask closed questions. For example, "Have you ever tried to calculate your financial position across your various bank accounts?"
- Lead the witness. For example, "Do you think it would be helpful to have a dashboard that allowed you to see all your banking information in one place?"
- Pitch your product. For example, "I'm building a great, easy-to-use dashboard product that will make your life simpler and will be available for a small monthly fee. Do you think you'd use it?"

As a guide, for business-to-business (B2B) startups, it's important to interview at least 50 customers, and for business-to-consumer (B2C) startups, you should aim for at least 200.

Wherever possible, frame your questions as falsifiable statements. Set a minimum success criterion above which you'll consider your hypothesis to be validated, and below which it will be invalidated.

If an assumption is validated, you should continue on your current path. If an assumption is invalidated, you need to consider a pivot or change in direction.

## Scenario 1

Emily is working on an idea for a personal banking product that consolidates multiple bank feeds into a streamlined dashboard interface.

By completing the Value Proposition Canvas and the Lean Canvas, Emily identified more than 20 assumptions. By using an Assumptions Matrix, she was able to narrow the list down. She then had five assumptions that she believed were highly important and about which she had relatively little knowledge. She also made sure that she had at least one assumption in each category of desirable, feasible, and viable.

Emily listed her top five assumptions as falsifiable statements, using a success threshold that she believed would give her some confidence to proceed. Along with each statement she identified whether the assumption was about desirability, feasibility, or viability.

Emily's top five assumptions:

1. I believe that at least 25 percent of banking customers have personal bank accounts with more than one bank. (Desirable)
2. I believe that at least 50 percent of these customers experience regular frustration with being unable to view all of their finances in one place. (Desirable)
3. I believe that at least 25 percent of these customers would be willing to pay $10 a month for a product that consolidated their bank feeds. (Viable)
4. I believe that it's possible for me to create a product that accesses bank feeds in close to real-time from all major banks and presents them in a simple dashboard. (Feasible)
5. I believe that at least 50 percent of these customers would be willing to sign up for a free trial of the product. (Viable)

## A note of caution about online surveys

It's tempting to believe that you can capture meaningful feedback from customers by sending out an online survey and analyzing the results. Surveys are quick and easy to create, but unfortunately, they're one of the least useful methods of capturing customer insights. Many people complete surveys with little thought about their responses. Even with well-constructed questions, you have no ability to delve deeper into interesting points that are raised by the respondent.

Surveys can play a useful role in capturing factual or numerical responses such as demographic information alongside customer interviews.

## Building user personas

A user persona, or customer persona, is a fictional character created to represent a specific type of user that you plan to serve.

User personas are important because they help you to develop empathy for your users and create a product with their specific needs in mind. The process of accurately defining user personas also helps you to make decisions about product functionality and design.

User personas are based on the insights you've gleaned from customer interviews. If you plan to serve multiple different customer segments, it's helpful to have a different persona representing each of these.

When creating your user personas, you should ask yourself: Who are we building this product for? Why would it be important to them? How will they use it? What barriers are they facing that we can take away?

It's a good idea to include a few fictional details to make user personas feel as realistic as possible.

A basic user persona should include at least the following:

- Personal information, such as the name and location, plus any details that help you to identify with the persona. If your startup is B2B, you should include a job title, company, and role description.
- Demographic information such as age, gender, family status, and income.
- A photo to represent the user and make them feel like a real person.
- Motivations that describe them as a person.
- Personality type.
- Goals for using your product (drawing on jobs-to-be-done, pains, and gains as discussed in the previous unit).
- Frustrations that they encounter while trying to do the job that your product is focused on.
- Brands they currently use in relation to their goals.
- Technology that they have access to and regularly use.

## Scenario 2

Emily has decided that based on her customer interviews her most important target users are busy professionals aged 40 to 55 with above-average income and multiple banking relationships. She's constructed the following "Busy Professional" persona to represent this target user.

She's incorporated some of the common themes that arose in her interviews with customers, such as the banking brands they currently associate with and the software products they'e familiar with and typically use.

**Task:** Create your own user persona

Create a user persona representing what you believe is your primary target user. Give the persona a name and description. Complete as many details as you can based on what you currently know about your target users. Check out the resources at the end of this module for some user persona templates for inspiration.
