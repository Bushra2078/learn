At the core of every startup is a value proposition. This statement explains what your product will do for your users, and what benefits they'll derive from using it.

When your startup is just an idea, the value proposition can be thought of as a set of untested hypotheses: you think you know which customers you'll serve, you think you know what job your product will do for them, and you think you know how your product will be valuable to them.

In this unit, we're going to use the Value Proposition Canvas, a simple one-page tool to capture and test each of these hypotheses and use feedback from customers to refine them. This is important. If you guess wrong and build a product that doesn't do the job your customers need or doesn't create enough value for them, they won't use it and you won't have a business.

There are three elements of a value proposition:

- What useful jobs does your product do for customers?
- What pain are you solving for them?
- What gain are you creating for them?

Let's look at each of these elements in detail.

## Jobs to be done

Any product can be viewed as a thing that gets a specific job done for a customer.

It's tempting to think of a product in terms of features, but it can be more useful to look at the jobs that it's going to do. Customers are more interested in what outcome your product can achieve for them than what the product itself is.

This concept was pioneered by the late Professor Clayton Christensen from Harvard University, who studied a wide range of products and asked, "What valuable job is this doing for the customer?"

A classic example: If you buy a drill, the job you're interested in getting done is creating a hole, which in turn might be because you want to mount a bookshelf on your wall. The job to be done by the drill is to create a hole, which enables you to mount your bookshelf. As a customer, you're more interested in the outcome than the tool by which you achieve it.

The same concept can be applied to startups. If you think about your product from the customer's perspective you can ask, "What job is it going to do for my customer?"

Try the following job story format as a way of expressing the job to be done from a customer's viewpoint:

- When \<description-of-the-situation-or-context\>
- I want to \<description-of-the-job-to-be-done\>
- So that \<description-of-the-outcome\>

Let's look at a simple example:

*When I'm working on a new startup idea, I want to find out quickly whether it's worth pursuing so that I spend my time on something that has a good chance of succeeding.*

## Task: Create a job story

Create a job story for your product using the above format, imagining that you're the customer. Remember that these are your hypotheses about why your customer wants your product to do a certain job, and what that job is. It's only by talking to customers that you can test and validate these hypotheses.

## Pain relievers and gain creators

For any product, it's possible to identify a pain that it relieves for customers, a gain that it creates for them, or in some cases, both outcomes.

Let's look first at pain relievers. These are products that reduce or eliminate a pain experienced by your customer when they're trying to get a particular job done. Examples of pains include:

- Cost.
- Risk.
- Wasted time.
- Distraction.

Pains can also be personal to the individual user, such as frustration, fear, anxiety, or loneliness.

It can be enlightening to talk to customers and understand what pains they would like your product to take away so that you can build the right product to achieve that. Your objective in talking to customers shouldn't be to sell them on your idea, but to ask a lot of open questions to understand as many of their pain points as you can.

Your next job is to prioritize those pain points so that you can address the most significant ones with your product. Customers are much more likely to use and pay for a product that reduces or eliminates a pain that is severe and occurs frequently than a pain which is mild and occurs rarely.

It's helpful to use a customer pain matrix that plots intensity versus frequency, as shown below. The pains in the top right-hand quadrant will be the ones you should focus your attention on.

Now let's look at gain creators. These are products that deliver something additional to your customer by successfully doing a particular job. Examples of gains include:

- Additional revenues.
- Improved efficiency.
- New skills or capabilities.

Gains can also be personal to the individual user, such as relaxation, enjoyment, or self-actualization.

Similar to painkillers, you can use feedback from customers to plot gains on a customer gain matrix using significance and immediacy as the two axes, as shown below.

:::image type="content" source="../media/learning-path-gain-matrix.png" alt-text="Chart that shows the relationship between the significance and immediacy of gains. A point indicates that a high significance, now, is ideal.":::

If you deliver a significant gain to a customer, and it occurs quickly after they use your product, they're more likely to want to use it than if you only deliver a minor gain, and it takes a while for them to achieve it.

The gains in the top right-hand quadrant will be the ones you should focus your attention on.

## Task: Identify pains and gains

Create a customer pains matrix and a customer gains matrix for your target customer. Go and talk to some customers and populate the matrices with the pains and gains they've told you about. Which pains or gains do you think you should try to address?

Hopefully by completing this quick task you'll get a feel for whether your product is viewed by customers as more of a pain reliever or a gain creator. This information will be extremely useful when you start writing copy for your website or anywhere else that you describe your product and its value proposition.

## Case study: Tylenol

Let's use Tylenol as a brief case study to help us delve deeper into pains and gains. Tylenol is of course a literal pain reliever and the job it's doing for the customer taking away a physical pain. At its most basic, the value proposition for Tylenol is pain relief.

However, if you ask customers why they want the pain taken away, they'll often tell you that pain stops them from being productive in their day or makes it harder for them to be fully present with friends and family. Therefore, we could argue that the real job being done by Tylenol is giving people back their day.

In the context of your own startup, make sure you're asking customers not just what functionality they would like from your product, but what outcome they want. Also ask why they want the outcome, and how important the functionality is to them.

## The Value Proposition Canvas

The [Value Proposition Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas?azure-portal=true) is a fantastic tool developed by Strategyzer. It's freely available for anyone to use as they visualize, design, and test business models.

The purpose of the Value Proposition Canvas is to help you to understand the needs of your target customer with reference to jobs-to-be-done, pains, and gains, and then to design your value proposition to accurately meet those needs.

:::image type="content" source="../media/value-proposition-canvas.png" alt-text="Diagram showing a gift box in a square with pain relievers, products, and gain creators. A circle next to the square has gains, pains, and customer jobs.":::

To use the canvas, start by describing the customer segment that you're focusing on in the top right-hand box.

Then move down and populate each of the three segments with responses from customers about what jobs they need to get done, what pains they want to have relieved, and what gains they'd like to achieve.

After you've interviewed a number of customers, you might start to see some trends in the jobs-to-be-done, pains, and gains they describe, and in how important they perceive each of these to be. This should give you some insights that will help you focus on the most important outcomes as you begin designing your value proposition.

Now move to the left-hand side of the canvas and design your value proposition. Populate each of the three segments, describing the product you believe will get the customer's key job(s) done, how it will relieve their most important pains, and how it will achieve their most important gains.

## Task: Complete your own Value Proposition Canvas

Let's put the Value Proposition Canvas into practice. Download the [Value Proposition Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas?azure-portal=true) by Strategyzer.com and Strategyzer AG.

Many people find it useful to print the canvas and use sticky notes to capture key points from customer conversations. Do whatever works best for you.

Now go and talk to customers or people who are representative of the customer segment you believe you should target, and find out what jobs they need your product to do, the pains they want it to relieve, and the gains they want it to create.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> - This isn't an introspection exercise. You can hypothesize about jobs, pains, and gains, but the only way you'll find out what customers really want is by talking to them individually.
> - If you have multiple customer segments you should create a Value Proposition Canvas for each segment.
