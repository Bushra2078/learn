There's a lot more to startups than just customer jobs-to-be-done, pains, and gains. In the beginning, your startup can be viewed as a large collection of assumptions, or untested hypotheses. It's vital that you work out which of these assumptions are most critical to the success of your company and systematically test them so that you can proceed with confidence that you're on the right track.

In this unit we're going to use the Lean Canvas as a tool for articulating assumptions about your business model, and then discuss some ways to prioritize them and systematically test the most important ones with customers.

## Why testing assumptions is vital

It's estimated that as many as 90 percent of all startups fail. Therefore, as a startup founder you need to have a healthy dose of self-belief that tells you that your company will be in the successful 10 percent despite the fact that the odds aren't in your favor.

However, self-belief by itself can be dangerous. The best founders are able to balance their own self-belief with an ability to think objectively about their startup, listen to feedback from customers, and act on that feedback even if it challenges the assumptions on which they've based their company.

All founders have a finite amount of capital and time available. By testing your assumptions, you can progressively reduce the uncertainty in your business while minimizing the time and money you spend on product development and growing your team. As you decrease the uncertainty, you'll be able to increase your investment and gradually shift from an exploration phase to an execution phase of building your business.

## Use the Lean Canvas

The [Lean Canvas](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas?azure-portal=true), developed by Ash Maurya, author of Running Lean, is a great way to capture the assumptions you have about all aspects of your business model.

The Lean Canvas is based on the well-known Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. It uses the structure of the Business Model Canvas and applies it to early-stage startups, making it easy for founders to spell out assumptions that relate to each of nine business model building blocks.

For early stage founders, the most critical assumptions about their startup's business model tend to relate to the three segments labeled "Customer Segments," "Problem," and "Solution."

A "Customer Segments" assumption is where you believe you know which potential customer you should focus on, and you've identified an early adopter persona representing the customers you'll target first.

A "Problem" assumption is where you believe you know what problem the target customer has, and that those customers view existing alternatives as inadequate.

A "Solution" assumption is where you believe that your product will be a better solution than existing alternatives, and a good enough fit for your target customers' needs that they'll choose to use it.

The Lean Canvas takes some of the inputs that we've discussed earlier in this unit such as customer, problem, and solution, and adds some vital business model blocks such as revenue streams, cost structure, channels, and key metrics.

**Task:** Complete your own Lean Canvas

Download the [Lean Canvas](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas?azure-portal=true) from leanstack.com.

Print the Lean Canvas and place your assumptions on the relevant section using sticky notes. Spend no more than 20 minutes, aim to write no more than one short sentence on each sticky note, and keep to a maximum of three sticky notes per block.

It's best to start with Problem, Customer Segments, Solution, and Unique Value Proposition because you've already worked on these using the Value Proposition Canvas before you move onto the other blocks.

## Identify critical assumptions

Now that you've captured a number of assumptions relating to your startup's value proposition and business model, it's time to work out which of these are the most critical to test with customers.

We can use design thinking principles to identify three categories of assumptions that you should test. They can be summarized by the following three questions:

- Is your product desirable?
  Do customers want it? Is this a problem that really exists and that your customers really care about?

- Is it feasible?
  Can you actually build this product? Do you have the technical skills? Do you have the necessary domain knowledge and the right connections?

- Is it viable?
  Can you build a commercially viable business around this? Are there enough potential customers that will pay enough for your product to achieve your commercial goals? Can you acquire customers cheaply enough that the lifetime value of those customers will be larger than the cost of acquiring them?

For your startup to be successful, you'll need a product that is desirable and feasible and viable. This can be represented as the intersect between three sets in a Venn diagram.

**Task:** Identify which assumptions to test

Review all of the assumptions that you captured by using the Value Proposition Canvas and Lean Canvas. Draw a large Venn diagram, and with a stack of new sticky notes, place each of your assumptions in one of the three categories.

Feel free to add any extra assumptions that you identify as part of this process. You can even color code them to match the three categories above.

You might end up with 20 or 30 assumptions. It's not practical to test them all, so your next objective is to work out which of these assumptions you should focus on testing.

One way to do this is to plot each assumption on an Assumptions Matrix where the vertical axis shows the importance of the assumption and the horizontal axis shows how much you know about it, as shown below.

:::image type="content" source="../media/learning-path-assumptions.png" alt-text="Chart that shows a matrix. One dimension runs from important to trivial. The other runs from known to unknown.":::

In this context, an *important* assumption is one that's critical to the success of the business. If it proves to be wrong, then your business is very unlikely to succeed. A *trivial* assumption, on the other hand, is one where it doesn't matter much whether it's right or wrong.

Similarly, an assumption that is *known* is one about which you have a high degree of confidence based on some facts or evidence. An *unknown* assumption is one about which you'e really just guessing.

It stands to reason that the assumptions you should focus on testing are the ones that are both important and unknown. By plotting all of your assumptions in this simple matrix, you can quickly arrive at a manageable number that you need to test. Ideally, you'll have at least one assumption in this quadrant from each category of desirable, feasible, and viable.
