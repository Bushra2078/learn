Our goal was to outline some core concepts relating to articulating and testing the assumptions on which your startup is based so that you can validate your core assumptions before investing time and money in building a product.

We used the Value Proposition Canvas to capture the jobs your customer needs done, the pains they want removed, and the gains they'd like to achieve. We used the Lean Canvas to capture assumptions relating to your business model and then used design thinking principles and a simple Assumptions Matrix to prioritize which of these assumptions should be tested.

We created a basic customer persona to represent your target customer and looked at various ways to test your most important assumptions, including customer interviews and experiments ranging from low-fidelity to high-fidelity.
