This module outlined core concepts that relate to articulating and testing the assumptions on which your startup is based. This information can help you validate your core assumptions before investing time and money in building a product.

We used the Value Proposition Canvas to capture the jobs that your customer needs done, the pains they want removed, and the gains they want to achieve. We also used the Lean Canvas to capture assumptions about your business model. We then used design thinking principles and a simple assumptions matrix to prioritize which of these assumptions should be tested.

We created a basic customer persona to represent your target customer and looked at various ways to test your most important assumptions. These tests included customer interviews and experiments that ranged from low fidelity to high fidelity.
