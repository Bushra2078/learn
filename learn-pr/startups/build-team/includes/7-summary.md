The goal of this module was to cover practical tips for building a high-performing startup team. These tips included understanding what attributes make great startup founders and the functional roles that need to be filled in most startups.

We discussed the pros and cons of bringing in cofounders versus hiring employees or engaging contractors. We looked at risk management approaches that you can use to protect the company in the event of conflict, such as having a cofounder agreement and implementing founder vesting.

We also discussed why inclusive hiring is a huge strategic advantage for startups. Finally, we covered practical ways in which you can use mentors to augment the capabilities of your core team.
