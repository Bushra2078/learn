Our goal was to cover some practical tips for building a high-performing startup team, including understanding what attributes make great startup founders and the functional roles that need to be filled in most startups.

We discussed the pros and cons of bringing in cofounders versus hiring employees or engaging contractors and looked at some risk management approaches you can use to protect the company in the event of conflict, such as having a cofounder agreement and implementing founder vesting.

Finally, we discussed why inclusive hiring is a huge strategic advantage for startups and covered some practical ways in which you can use mentors to augment the capabilities of your core team.
