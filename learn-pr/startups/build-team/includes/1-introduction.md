When working on an early-stage startup, founders should keep some personal considerations in mind:

- What it's really like to found a startup
- How to manage your time and energy
- When to transition to building your business full-time

In this module, we're going to expand on these concepts and cover some practical tips for building a high-performing startup team. We'll also discuss steps you can take to make it easier to manage your team as it grows and set your company up for success.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll learn:

- The core attributes and skill sets that make up successful startup teams.
- The pros and cons of cofounders versus employees versus contractors.
- How to use founder vesting to align interests and optimize retention.
- Why inclusive hiring is a huge strategic advantage.
- How to use mentors to augment the capabilities of your core team.
- How to find the help you need through the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub mentor network and your local community.

> [!NOTE]
> Every startup is different, and every founder has their own unique perspective. With that in mind, in this module we'll aim to discuss principles that apply broadly rather than attempt to be prescriptive about what your startup team should look like or how you should go about building it.
