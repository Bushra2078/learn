In this unit, we're going to explore how inclusive hiring can be a source of competitive advantage for your startup.

We'll look specifically at gender diversity, ethnic diversity, neurodiversity, and people with differing ability. But the concepts we'll discuss apply more broadly and are intended to reflect a focus on diversity in the broadest possible sense.

## Gender diversity

In the U.S., only [20 percent of seed-funded startups have a female founder](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/eoy-2019-diversity-report-20-percent-of-newly-funded-startups-in-2019-have-a-female-founder/?azure-portal=true), and startups founded by women receive only around 2 percent of all venture capital invested.

One of the reasons for this is that only [8 percent of partners at venture capital firms are women, and three quarters of US venture capital firms don't have any female partners](https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-other-diversity-dividend?azure-portal=true). It's been shown that [bias, unconscious or otherwise, has a dramatic effect on investment decisions](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/17-067_b5578676-e44c-40aa-a9d8-9e72c287afe8.pdf?azure-portal=true).

Nevertheless, a recent study by BCG found that venture-backed startups with [women founders generated more than twice as much revenue per dollar invested than startups founded by men](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet?azure-portal=true).

The reasons for better performance of startups with women founders include greater diversity of thinking, better empathy for customer needs, particularly in startups targeting female customers, and a greater ability to build cohesive teams.

## Ethnic diversity

According to a recent study by Kauffmann Fellows, 79 percent of US startup founders and executives are white, 16 percent Asian, 3 percent Latinx and 2 percent black. Yet the same study found that [ethnically diverse startup founding teams raise significantly more money per startup from investors and generate greater returns](https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/the-pipeline-myth-ethnicity-fund-managers?azure-portal=true).

Again, bias has been shown to play a large part in this discrepancy. A [study by Paul Gompers and Silpa Kovvali from Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/17-067_b5578676-e44c-40aa-a9d8-9e72c287afe8.pdf?azure-portal=true) showed that investors are 39 percent more likely to invest in startups founded by people of the same race as them. At the same time, only 2 percent of venture capital investors are Hispanic, and fewer than 1 percent are black.

The reasons for greater performance by ethnically diverse teams include greater diversity of ideas and perspectives, greater objectivity in decision-making, and less susceptibility to group-think.

## Neurodiversity

It's estimated that around [17 percent of the population are neurodiverse](https://www.workdesign.com/2019/12/designing-for-neurodiversity-and-inclusion/?azure-portal=true). This definition includes people with autism (2 percent of the population), ADHD (4 percent) and Dyslexia (10 percent).

According to Perrine Farque, author of the book [Inclusion](https://www.amazon.com/Inclusion-Ultimate-Secret-Organizations-Success/dp/1946425834?azure-portal=true), neurodiverse people can excel in thinking creatively about problems because they've had to adapt to difficult situations and solve problems in their own lives.

Also, [many on the autism spectrum can sustain focus over longer periods of time](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-neurodivergent-talents-competitive-advantage-tech-perrine/?azure-portal=true) compared to neurotypical employees, and can pick up patterns and connections especially well. These abilities make them valuable in roles that involve pattern recognition or data analysis, such as software QA, image analysis, or cybersecurity.

For these reasons, large companies such as [SAP, Hewlett Packard, and Microsoft have created programs to attract neurodiverse employees](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-neurodivergent-talents-competitive-advantage-tech-perrine/?azure-portal=true). In numerous examples, [participants out-perform other employees by as much as 30 percent](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-neurodivergent-talents-competitive-advantage-tech-perrine/?azure-portal=true).

## People of differing ability

One in four adults in the US have some type of disability, which includes challenges with [mobility (14 percent), cognition (11 percent), hearing (6 percent) and vision (5 percent)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html?azure-portal=true).

The inclusion of people with disabilities in product development has been shown to greatly improve companies' ability to build products that need to be accessible by those with disabilities. Doing so is becoming not just desirable but mandated in many settings and is much easier to achieve if your team includes people with a disability.

Research has also shown that teams composed of people with disabilities make better business decisions and develop products that are more in tune with customers' changing needs. This leads to [revenue increases of up to 19 percent](https://www.fastcompany.com/90603481/4-reasons-why-hiring-disabled-workers-is-good-for-business?azure-portal=true).

Yet disabled workers represent a large, under-utilized talent pool. [In late 2020, the unemployment rate for disabled workers was twice the national average](https://www.fastcompany.com/90603481/4-reasons-why-hiring-disabled-workers-is-good-for-business?azure-portal=true).

## Other types of diversity

As we noted above, this unit sets out to cover diversity in the broadest possible sense. Examples of other types of diversity that should be considered include:

- Religious beliefs.
- Age.
- Socioeconomic status.
- Formerly incarcerated individuals.
- Sexual orientation.
- Gender identity.
- Cultural identity.

## How and why to build a diverse team

Below are some of the ways in which startups can benefit from [building teams that embrace diversity and inclusion](https://medium.com/swlh/driving-financial-performance-with-diversity-43eba2de0315?azure-portal=true):

- Greater diversity of ideas and perspectives.
- Avoid group-think caused by team homogeneity.
- Greater employee job satisfaction, trust and engagement.
- Enhanced team decision-making.
- Stronger corporate social responsibility practices.
- Better reputation and goodwill in the community in which the company operates.
- Higher sales conversion rates (Research has shown that [consumers are more likely to purchase a product if they perceive the company to be diverse or inclusive.](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of-marketing/management-and-culture/diversity-and-inclusion/thought-leadership-marketing-diversity-inclusion/?azure-portal=true)).
- Better understanding of diverse customer groups, reaching product-market fit faster.
- More authentic communication with diverse customer groups.
- Easier to recruit candidates from diverse backgrounds.
- Easier to recruit candidates for whom a diverse workplace is an important consideration. (A survey by Glassdoor found [67 percent of candidates consider workforce diversity when evaluating a job offer](https://medium.com/swlh/driving-financial-performance-with-diversity-43eba2de0315?azure-portal=true).)
- Minimize staff turnover caused by lack of diversity in the workplace or a lack of consideration for the needs of diverse employees.

It's clear that creating a diverse team can be a massive competitive advantage for startups. The diverse population is a highly skilled but under-utilized talent pool. Startups that can attract and retain the right candidates can use this enhanced talent to their advantage and outperform companies with less diverse teams.  

Calendly is a great example of a company benefiting from a focus on diversity. It has implemented a number of diversity programs to encourage and support employees from diverse backgrounds, including programs specifically for women of color. It has become recognized as a highly desirable employer, with [96 percent of employees reporting it's a great place to work](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/7023983?azure-portal=true) compared to a US average of 59 percent of employees.

Attracting and retaining diverse candidates requires creating a work environment that enables them to deliver their best work. Thought needs to be given to how to achieve this before recruiting. For example, there's no point in recruiting a candidate with autism unless you've understood their needs (which might include minimizing visual and auditory distractions) and created a work environment that allows them to be productive.

How you go about building a diverse team depends on where you're starting from. As a rule, what you start with scales. Once your team is around 12 people, the level of diversity in the team is likely to remain static as the company grows, due largely to the influence of unconscious bias in hiring decisions.

On the other hand, if you have a high level of diversity by the time you reach 12 people, there's a much better chance you'll be able to retain that diversity as the team grows.

Therefore, if you already have a diverse founding team, and the team has significant diversity in their networks, you may find that with only a modest additional effort, you can continue to attract and retain a diverse workforce as the company grows.

If on the other hand your founding team is homogenous and your networks lack diversity, it's likely you'll need to take deliberate steps to broaden your reach and overcome unconscious bias in hiring.

Following are some practical tips for inclusive hiring, based on lessons from founders who have successfully built diverse teams:

- Understand the make-up of your existing team and acknowledge any lack of diversity from the outset.
- Consider taking [unconscious bias training](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/beyond-microsoft/default.aspx?azure-portal=true). It may reveal biases that you or your co-founders weren't aware of and help you to overcome them as you grow the team.
- Develop a strategy for inclusive hiring and publish it on your web site. Avoid *diversity theater* and ensure that your actual hiring decisions match what you say in your strategy.
- Review all your communications including website, social media, and email campaigns. Reflect on whether they represent the diversity that you're seeking to achieve within your company.
- If your team is still small, consider enlisting a group of peers from diverse backgrounds to sanity check your diversity plans, communications, work environment, and hiring processes.
- Appoint someone within your team (ideally a founder) to lead diversity and inclusion and attach performance metrics to the achievement of agreed diversity goals.
- Reach out to programs that support the development of diverse communities and look for ways to tap into their networks.
- Connect with other founders who have successfully built diverse teams and seek out their advice. Some of them may also act as a referral source for great candidates.
