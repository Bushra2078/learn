The term *mentor* is used to refer to many different types of relationships, but in startups it's generally a reference to tapping into the expertise and networks of more experienced founders, industry professionals, or investors.

The main reason startup founders seek out mentors is to short-circuit the learning curve. By tapping into guidance from more experienced founders (especially those who have been through the startup loop multiple times), new founders can more quickly find the right path to growth, overcome obstacles, and avoid making critical mistakes. A good mentor can also help startup founders to broaden their network and connect with others who can help them as their business grows.

Just as inclusive hiring can be a source of competitive advantage, broadening the capabilities of your team via experienced mentors can be a hugely beneficial step.

In this unit, we'll focus on two types of mentoring:

- Informal connections that you make directly with experienced founders and investors
- Structured mentoring relationships such as those found in most incubator and accelerator programs

We'll also briefly discuss the mentor network that's part of the [Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub](https://startups.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) and explain how you can tap into this valuable resource.

## What makes a good mentor

Not everyone who has launched a startup makes a good mentor, even if they've been successful. As highlighted by venture capitalist Bryce Roberts, "When successful people give advice, I hear this: Here are the lottery numbers I played. They worked for me!"

In many cases, successful entrepreneurs have difficulty articulating what it was that led to their success. When they have single-time successes, their one set of experiences may not be directly relevant to other startups, particularly if those startups are in different industries or pursuing different business models.

The best mentors are often those who have broad positive and negative experiences spanning multiple startups, as well as a depth of understanding of startup best practices.

Following are some attributes to look for when seeking out a mentor for your startup:

- Experience in more than one successful startup, either as a founder, early employee or early-stage investor
- Experience in failed startups, particularly if they're able to articulate why the company failed
- Experience in running startup programs such as incubators or accelerators, as long as this is coupled with direct, hands-on experience in startups rather than an academic perspective
- Has a broad network of founders, investors, or potential customers with whom they could help you connect
- Willing to give up some time to work with founders with no expectation of payment (refer to comments below regarding mentor motivations)
- Willing to say "I don't know" when asked a question that's outside their expertise
- Doesn't sell services such as consulting to startups, because this often means the mentoring relationship is a thinly veiled business development activity

Good mentoring generally follows a Socratic approach in which the mentor guides founders, mainly by asking open questions and encouraging them to consider other possibilities, rather than by attempting to give them the answers, or even worse, by telling them what to do and expecting compliance.

## What motivates mentors?

We've said that mentors are successful and experienced people who are willing to give you their time for free. It's important to ask why people with such valuable skills might be motivated to do this.

If the mentor is an experienced founder who has achieved success, it's common that they themselves have benefited from access to mentors as they grew their own company. In most startup ecosystems, there's a strong *pay-it-forward* ethos in which successful founders give back to the startup community through mentoring and sometimes angel investing.

In fact, this *pay-it-forward* ethos is at the heart of successful startup ecosystems such as Silicon Valley. It's increasingly common in other maturing startup ecosystems around the world due to the valuable *flywheel effect* it has on attracting and producing founders and investors.

Many successful entrepreneurs are willing to provide mentoring to first-time founders as long as they can see there's a fit between their experience and the startup, the founders are coachable and willing to listen to advice, and the founders are respectful of the mentor's time.

There are a growing number of mentors whose motivations hinge on increasing diversity in startups and supporting founders from minority backgrounds. Some of these mentors are available through startup programs that work exclusively with under-represented founders.

If the mentor is an early-stage investor, their motivation may be a combination of pay-it-forward and a desire to find and cultivate quality deal-flow. In some cases, this means that the mentoring relationship will only work if the investor views the startup as a genuine investment prospect.

If the mentor is employed by an organization that runs a startup program such as an accelerator, their role will generally include providing mentoring to those startups that have been accepted into the program. In many cases, this role is referred to as an *entrepreneur-in-residence* or EIR.

Finally, there are opportunities to engage experienced founders and others in a paid capacity, although this is more commonly viewed as consulting rather than mentoring and meets a different set of needs.

## How to find good mentors

There are many ways to tap into high-quality mentoring, and the best way to find good mentors will depend on the maturity of your local startup ecosystem. Below are some practical tips that are likely to be helpful no matter where you're located:

- Engage with your local startup community via networking events, pitch competitions, hackathons and mentor-matching events.
- Take part in a structured startup program such as an accelerator, as long as it's delivered by mentors with broad startup experience as discussed above.
- Connect with other founders, ask them who they have found to be good mentors, and ask for introductions.
- Search online for people who have built successful companies that have some similarities to yours (sector focus, customer persona or business model) and reach out to them directly.
- Utilize the mentor network that's part of the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub (more on that below).

## How to make best use of mentors

Despite the fact that mentoring is usually not a paid relationship, it's critical that you make the best possible use of this scarce resource and ensure that you don't overstep reasonable boundaries.

The following are some practical tips to help you make the best use of mentors:

- Have an agenda for your mentoring meetings, ideally with no more than two or three topics on which you're seeking input.
- Avoid asking your mentor questions that you could have answered by doing a quick online search, reading a basic startup book, or by asking one of your peers.
- If you have an ongoing mentoring relationship, have a summary of the key points from your last meeting and demonstrate that you've acted on them.
- If you're seeking introductions, have a clear idea of who in the mentor's network you wish to be connected with and why.
- Make it easy for your mentor to introduce you to others by sending them a short self-contained email with brief background, the name of the person you're hoping to connect with, your specific question or request, and your contact details. Many introductions will be in the form of a [double-opt-in](https://hughstephens.com/2018/11/how-i-make-double-opt-in-intros-and-how-to-accept-one/?azure-portal=true), so don't be surprised if it takes a couple of days or more to make the connection. Once you do make contact, be sure to close the loop with your mentor by sending them a brief email advising the outcome.
- If you have access to multiple mentors, be prepared for *mentor whiplash*, in which you'll receive different perspectives from different individuals. This is a common occurrence and reflects the reality that in startups, there's generally no absolutely right or absolutely wrong answer. Your job is to consider each perspective fully, make a decision on the course of action to take, and keep your mentors informed of your progress.
- Mentor meetings usually are no more than 30 minutes in length. This allows you to be focused and reduces the overhead on the mentor's already busy schedule.

## Conclusions

- There are several important personal attributes that should exist within every startup founding team. It's helpful to consider your current team's strengths and weaknesses and identify any gaps that need to be filled.
- There are several broad functional roles that need to be filled in most early-stage startup teams. It's important to make sure that every member of the team is clear on which roles they're responsible for, and that all roles are covered, or you have a plan for how to cover them as you grow your team.
- If you're a sole founder, bringing a cofounder into your startup is likely to increase your chances of success by helping you stay on top of the workload, providing moral support and helping you to make better decisions. It's generally easier to bring in a cofounder at (or close to) the beginning of the journey than once you've launched a product.
- It's never too early to start building a wish-list of possible candidates you might hire once your startup has funding. By cultivating your relationships with these people, you'll be in a much stronger position to find and hire the right person quickly when you have the need and the funding.
- A cofounder agreement is a good way to reduce the risk of serious cofounder conflict by setting out how the cofounders will make decisions, how they'll resolve disagreements, and what happens in the event that an agreement can't be reached.
- Founder vesting is a simple way to protect the company in the event that a founder leaves, by ensuring each founder earns their equity over time, contingent on their ongoing involvement and performance.
- Inclusive hiring can be a source of competitive advantage for your startup. By deliberately creating a diverse team, you can tap into a highly skilled but under-utilized talent pool and out-perform startups with less diverse teams.
- By tapping into mentoring from experienced founders, new founders can quickly find the right path to growth, overcome obstacles, and avoid making critical mistakes, as well as expand their network.
