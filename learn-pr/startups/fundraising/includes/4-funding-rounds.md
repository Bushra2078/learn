Raising money for your startup is one of the hardest things you'll do as a founder. It can be an intense and time-consuming process, and one that almost always involves numerous rejections before a round is successfully closed. 

In this unit, we'll cover some basic practical tips that will help you to approach the right investors and streamline the process of raising a funding round.

## Create an investor wish list

Most funding rounds involve more than one investor, with two to five investors being fairly typical. However, it's common for startup founders to approach dozens of investors before they get the small number of commitments needed to close a funding round.

How do you decide which investors to approach, and in what order?

The first step before contacting any investors is to do some research and determine which investors might be interested in your company. This involves a consideration of sector focus, stage of investment, and also geography, bearing in mind that most investors prefer to invest in companies located close enough that they can meet in person (although this has changed markedly over the last couple of years).

Once you have a list of potential investors, it's a good idea to rank them in order of preference. At the top of the list should be the investors that you most want to have as shareholders in your company. This might be because of their sector experience, networks, strong brand, or because you've spoken to founders they've backed previously who have said they're great to work with.

At the bottom of the list should be investors that you would be willing to have as shareholders, but who are less desirable because they have shallower expertise in your sector, they're general partners who don't have experience as founders, or because the feedback from other founders is less positive.

It's never a good idea to initiate contact with investors you wouldn't accept an investment from. This is a waste of your time and theirs.

There are two schools of thought on which investors to approach first.

If you're highly confident of your investment proposition and your pitch is polished, you should start at the top of the list and pitch the investors you most want to invest. If they agree to invest, you'll close your funding round in the shortest time possible and avoid wasting time with less valuable investors.

On the other hand, if this is your first time raising a funding round, your pitch is a little shaky, or your company only just meets the investability threshold for your target investors, it might be a good idea to start at the bottom of your list.

By pitching less desirable investors, you'll gain valuable experience in pitching your startup. You'll also receive feedback and questions from these investors that you'll be able to integrate into subsequent pitches. By the time you make it to the top of your list, your pitch will be much more solid, and you should be able to anticipate most of the likely questions you'll receive.

The disadvantage of this approach is that it will take longer, you'll have more meetings, and you may even receive investment offers from your non-preferred investors. Many founders find it very difficult to say no to an investment offer, because they run the risk of saying no and then not receiving offers from any of their preferred investors.
  
## Make contact with investors

Almost all investors allow startups to send unsolicited pitches, either by cold email or through a form on their website. However, well-known investors often receive many hundreds of unsolicited approaches that are of highly variable quality. As a result, your pitch may receive very little time and attention.

In contrast, the majority of early-stage investments come via referral from someone whose judgment the investor trusts. These pitches are often taken more seriously and receive a more thorough review.

Therefore, once you've decided which investors you plan to contact, it's advisable to get a warm introduction via a mutual connection if you have one, or through a founder of one of their existing portfolio companies.

Building relationships with investors takes time. Most investors are receptive to having informal discussions with founders well before you begin the process of raising your funding round.

Investors are generally happy to share their experiences with early-stage founders as part of their outreach and deal-sourcing activities. By getting to know you and your company, they're able to offer you some light-touch input and connections to other founders or investors, potentially over a period of a few months.

At the same time, they'll get to see you in action, get a sense of the speed and urgency with which you execute, see whether you follow through on the advice and connections they offer, and gauge whether they'd be happy to be in a long-term business relationship with you.

By building relationships with investors in this way, you'll greatly increase the chances of them committing when you're ready to open your funding round.

## Approach investors in parallel rather than in series

One of the most common mistakes made by first-time founders is to approach too few investors at the outset.

Once you've initiated contact with an investor, it may take several months before you know with certainty whether or not they're going to invest. If you've only made contact with a small handful of investors, you run the risk that all of them will pass on the round and you'll have to restart the entire process with another set of investors, greatly increasing the time to closing your funding round.

Approaching investors in series also means you have very little opportunity for competitive tension, so there will be less incentive for each investor to offer attractive terms. It can even lead to highly unfavorable terms if investors are aware that without their money, your company could run out of cash.

Finally, startups that are on the fundraising trail for an extended period start to look questionable, because investors will ask why after many months you've still not secured your required funding.

In contrast, if you make initial contact with 10 to 20 investors in parallel, you'll greatly increase the chances of closing your funding round quickly. The up-front workload is higher, but using this approach will enable you to treat fundraising like a sales funnel and prioritize your efforts on those investors who appear most likely to proceed. Even if the majority of investors pass on your funding round, you'll still have enough candidate investors in the pipeline that you won't need to restart the entire process.

You may also be able to achieve some competitive tension as investors realize they need to move quickly and offer attractive terms in order to not miss out.

## Find a lead investor

Most funding rounds involve multiple investors. However, in most cases, just one investor will do the majority of pre-investment work and will often be the first to commit funding. This investor is generally referred to as the *lead investor*.

Finding a lead investor is extremely important because their commitment signals to other investors that someone they trust has evaluated your startup as a worthy investment. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable when the lead investor is a top-tier VC fund or well-known angel investor. There have been many occasions on which previously undecided investors have committed within just days of learning that a lead investor has committed to a funding round.

Therefore, as a startup founder, one of your objectives should be to find true believers who will make an early decision to back your company and help you to secure the additional investors you need to close your funding round.

Conversely, it's rarely a good idea to spend time trying to convert potential investors who are on the fence, or who don't show a sense of urgency in progressing an investment in your company.

## Understand term sheets

A term sheet is a short legal agreement between your company and an investor that sets out the key terms of a proposed investment. Term sheets are normally not legally binding, except for clauses relating to confidentiality (you can't disclose the term sheet to other parties) and non-solicitation (you commit to proceeding with the investment and can't shop the term sheet around to other investors in an attempt to secure better terms).

Once investors have signed a term sheet, they'll generally commence due diligence (discussed below), and as long as no major issues are identified, the transaction will be documented in a more substantive set of legal agreements. Funds will only be transferred to your company's bank account after these agreements are signed.

Term sheets are an important part of the fundraising process because they allow investors to make an in-principle commitment to invest, but without the overhead of negotiating detailed legal agreements. They also allow startups to have some degree of confidence about which investors are committed and on what terms.

The content of term sheets is beyond the scope of this unit. However, it's highly advisable for startup founders to be familiar with the key terminology and concepts contained in term sheets, and also to have put some thought into preparing a term sheet of their own.

## Be prepared for due diligence

Once you've signed a term sheet, an investor will generally commence due diligence. This is the process by which they evaluate your startup in more depth, verify that the things you've told them are true, and scrutinize critical information such as existing legal agreements with employees or contractors, to ensure that there are no serious obstacles to your company succeeding.

There's no single due diligence checklist that all investors use. However, there are some common themes that most investors are interested in. The following sections list due diligence review topics that most early-stage investors will want to review.

||Topics|
|---|---|
|**Corporate**|Confirm company structure, incorporation documents, list of shareholders, and class of shares.<br><br>Copy of shareholders agreement.|
|**Intellectual property (IP)**|Confirm ownership by the company of all relevant IP assets.<br><br>Confirm deed of assignment conferring ownership of the IP created by employees and contractors.<br><br>Confirm non-reliance on IP assets that aren't owned by the company.|
|**Financial**|Identify any outstanding debts or other financing arrangements.<br><br>Historical financial reports verified by company accountant.<br><br>Details of any financial breaches or disputes.|
|**Contracts**|Details of all material contracts, including with employees, contractors, suppliers, customers.<br><br>Copies of all material contracts.<br><br>Details of any contractual breaches or disputes.|
|**Investment**|Details of any prior investments, including identity of investor, investment terms.|
|**Assets**|Register of all material assets or real property owned by the company.|
|**Employees**|List of all current and past employees including roles, responsibilities, remuneration, and stock options.<br><br>Details of any disputes or claims.<br><br>Copies of all employment agreements.|
|**Insurance**|Details of any current insurance policies including claims made and any disputes.|
|**Litigation**|Details of any existing or threatened proceedings by third parties.|
|**Regulatory**|Details of any government approvals, licenses, or permits obtained or required.|

As a founder, you'll want to ensure that investors can complete due diligence in the shortest time possible. You can streamline this process greatly by creating a secure online repository of all relevant documents (sometimes referred to as a *data room*) and sharing a link with the investor.

## Conclusions

- Not all startups need to raise external capital, but it's important to think through the implications of self-funding, or bootstrapping, versus external funding.
- Not all startups are capable of raising capital, and many founders underestimate the rate of growth and scale they'll need to achieve in order to generate an acceptable return to investors.
- Investors view startups through the lens of their investment portfolio and will only invest in startups that can generate a return that makes up for all the companies in their portfolio that don't succeed.
- Most investors don't invest in ideas. They look for traction as evidence that the business is meeting a customer need. The best form of traction is profit, followed by revenue, then customer engagement.
- It's important to understand different types of investors and the non-financial value they bring. A good rule of thumb for choosing investors: Smart, involved money > Dumb, passive money > Dumb, involved money.  
- Raising a funding round requires strategic decisions about which investors to approach, and in which order. Most successful funding rounds involve pitching a number of investors in parallel.
- To close a funding round, you'll need to be ready for due diligence. You can streamline this process by preparing a data room in advance.
