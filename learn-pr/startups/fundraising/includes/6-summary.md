Our goal was to outline the process of raising money from investors to fund the growth of your startup. 

We discussed the pros and cons of raising money from investors versus bootstrapping. We looked at practical considerations to help you decide whether to raise external funding for your startup.

We discussed different types of investors and what each is looking for in a potential investment. Then we worked through a hypothetical example to highlight the perspective of an early-stage investor.

Finally, we reviewed some practical aspects of how to raise a funding round. We also discussed some steps you can take to streamline the process.
