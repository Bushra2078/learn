In this unit, we'll delve deeper into principles of pitching. We'll look at the purpose of pitching, the pitching audience, and different formats pitches can take.

## Why are you pitching?

Every time you deliver a pitch you should have a clear purpose in mind.

It's common for founders to view investor pitches as an opportunity to get a commitment for funding, just as you might see on shows such as Shark Tank.

This is rarely the case. Most of the time, a pitch is just the start of a conversation. By getting people interested in what you're doing, you're encouraging them to connect with you after the pitch and find out more.

If you're pitching at a public event such as an accelerator demo day, the purpose of your pitch is to act as a short teaser that gives some small nuggets of information and makes your audience want to know more.

If you're pitching an investor such as an angel group or a venture capital fund, it's likely that most of the people in the room know very little about your company, and your pitch will be the first of many meetings before you actually have money in the bank.

## Who are you pitching?

The most impactful pitches are delivered at just the right level for the audience. By understanding your audience's objectives and their current level of knowledge about your company and sector, you'll be able to deliver a pitch that's informative without being condescendingly simple or overloading them with unfamiliar terminology.

Most people tend to underestimate the gap between their knowledge and that of their audience, resulting in the audience missing out on key points because they don't understand the industry, the technology, market dynamics, or terminology.

If you lose your audience early in your pitch, it's likely that they'll switch off and you'll struggle to keep their attention for the remainder of your presentation.

> Road test your pitch on people who aren't involved in your startup and don't work in your sector. Doing this can help you to identify concepts that need to be explained up-front, and makes sure you don't use jargon, technical details, or names of other companies that are familiar to you, but not to others.

A good rule of thumb is to only refer to anything that you're confident that at least 90 percent of your audience will know about.

## Pitch formats

Startup founders need to be familiar with several pitch formats. Let's review some of the most important ones.

### Elevator pitch

An elevator pitch is a short, pithy description of your company that you can use in casual conversation.

Let's say you're at a networking event, you meet an investor, and they ask you, "What does your company do?" What do you say? Try it right now. Can you in one or two sentences give a clear and compelling explanation of what your company does? Do you think your elevator pitch would get a potential investor interested to know more?

Unless you've had a lot of practice at this, it's likely your elevator pitch will need work. Many startup founders find it helpful to script their elevator pitch and memorize it, rather than attempt to come up with something on the fly.

One format that's proved to be a good starting point is the Gaddie Pitch, named after marketing expert Anthony Gaddie. It comprises three sentences:

- **You know how** \<target-customer\>\<problem\>.
- **Well, what we do is** \<description-of-how-to-solve-the-problem-or-deliver-benefits\> by \<solution\>.
- **In fact**, \<facts-and-examples\>.

Here's an example of a Gaddie Pitch for Canva:

**You know how** good graphic design is really important to every company.

**Well, what we do is** provide simple online tools for anyone to make professional presentations, social media graphics, and more in just a few minutes.

**In fact**, since we launched in 2012, our customers have created over 5 billion designs using Canva.

### Demo day pitch

Startups pitching at an accelerator demo day will typically be asked to deliver a pitch ranging anywhere from one minute to five minutes. Demo day pitches generally have a firm time limit, allow for a small number of PowerPoint slides, and may or may not allow for questions from a panel at the end.

Some demo days are delivered to a public audience, which can amount to hundreds of attendees (or many thousands if it's delivered online), or they can be restricted to an invitation-only list of mainly early-stage investors.

Investors who attend accelerator demo days are usually there for one reason: to find new investment opportunities. Investors, like everyone else, suffer from FOMO, and an investor's worst nightmare is attending a demo day event and not following up with a startup that turns out to be the next unicorn.

Therefore, your primary aim at a demo day pitch should be to convey that your startup is one of the ones that has a shot at building a hugely successful business, and investors would be wise to follow up with you.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all accelerator demo days have moved to being completely online, and this trend is likely to continue. You should assume that your pitch will exist online in perpetuity, which means you should avoid disclosing anything that's highly sensitive or that could jeopardize fundraising opportunities in the future.

### Video pitch

Many accelerators and other startup programs require a short video pitch as part of their application process. These vary in length, but 60 to 90 seconds is fairly typical.

Distilling your startup down to a short video can be challenging, but remember that your objective is to convey why your startup should be accepted into the program ahead of others, not to go into detail about your product, the size of the market, or the backgrounds of your team.

Accelerators usually invest in the startups they accept, so just like demo day pitches, it's important to convey that your startup has a shot at building a hugely successful business.

Accelerators are also looking for startup teams that are coachable. They want to know that you're genuinely interested in the advice and guidance available from the accelerator, and that you recognize there are aspects of your startup you need help with.

Tips for completing an accelerator application video:

- Keep to the requested time limit.
- Upload your video to YouTube and provide a link (the video can be marked as unlisted but not private or password-protected).
- No slides, no fancy graphics, just the founders talking.
- Clear audio (use an external mic if possible).
- Informal, not reading a script â€“ although preparing your thoughts in advance is worthwhile.

## Task: Create your own Gaddie Pitch

Create your own Gaddie Pitch. If you don't yet have millions of users like Canva, you can use the *in fact* sentence to describe your early traction, the size of the market, or a recent customer anecdote.

Once you're happy with it, test it out on some friends by delivering your pitch and asking them to pitch back to you, describing what your company does in their own words. If they can describe your company reasonably accurately, that's a sign that your pitch is on target. If they struggle with it, you've got more work to do.

## Investor pitch

An investor pitch is one where you've been invited to present to an investor such as an early-stage venture capital fund, or a group of investors such as an angel group. It normally comes after the investor has reviewed some preliminary information and often met informally with the founders.

A typical investor meeting might run for 30 to 60 minutes, and it's common for the first half of the meeting to be used for you to deliver your pitch, followed by time for questions and discussion.

To prepare for an investor meeting, it's helpful to know:

- Who you'll be presenting to, so that you can research their backgrounds.
- The length of the meeting and how long they expect you to present for.
- If the meeting is online, what video platform will be used so that you can ensure you're familiar with it beforehand and are set up with good audio and video.
- If the meeting is in-person, the exact location so you can plan travel, parking, etc. and be there on time.
- What AV facilities are available, and whether they expect you to use your laptop (in which case you may need to bring adapters) or theirs (in which case you may need to send the presentation through in advance).

## Types of pitch decks

There are two distinct types of pitch deck that every startup should have before talking to investors. Let's discuss these, and also how to use a short executive summary to complement them.

### Presentable deck

A presentable deck is the one that you'll use when you deliver your presentation either in person or online. It should be very light on words, and just have key graphics or images so that it supports the points you make verbally, rather than attempting to convey them in writing.

If you were to send a presentable deck to someone, it's likely that they wouldn't be able to glean much about your company from it.

### Readable deck

Many angel groups and venture capital funds ask founders to submit a pitch deck online before they'll consider inviting you to present.

The deck that you send to an investor should be self-contained and have enough detail that someone who knows nothing about your company could read it, make sense of it, and most importantly reach a view that your company could be an investment candidate worth meeting.

It's always a good idea to be cautious about who you send your readable deck to, because it's likely to contain confidential details about your company.

### Executive summary

It's useful to have a one-page executive summary to complement your pitch decks.

An executive summary can be an ideal document to send to potential investors that you meet at networking events or demo days. It's a great way of following up with a short, high-level overview of your company.

> [!TIP]
> Have the executive summary saved as a .pdf file and a link readily available on your phone so that when you meet someone, you can quickly email them a link to the document on the spot.
