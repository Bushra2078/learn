In this module, you learned about pitching your startup company to interested parties, and to investors in particular. We outlined some practical steps you can take to create and deliver compelling pitches to accelerators, angel investors, venture capital funds, and other investors.

We also outlined the content that goes into a typical investor pitch and how to avoid the most common mistakes in pitching investors.

Finally, we presented videos of example pitch techniques, which you can apply as you create, practice, and fine-tune your own presentations.
