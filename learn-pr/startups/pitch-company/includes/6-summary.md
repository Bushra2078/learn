Our goal was to introduce you to pitching. We outlined some practical steps you can take to create and deliver a compelling pitch to investors such as accelerators, angel investors, and venture capital funds.

We also discussed what content should go into a typical investor pitch and how to avoid some of the most common mistakes in pitching investors.

Finally, we looked at some example pitches as a way of identifying techniques that you can make use of as you create and practice your own pitch.
