There's no single right or wrong pitch deck format, although there's general agreement about the topics that should be included in a good investor pitch deck.

The following outline lists the key topics that most investors want to see covered, along with comments about what should go on each slide. It can be helpful as a checklist to ensure you include essential topics. Feel free to reorder the topics to suit your delivery.

## Investor pitch deck outline

> [!NOTE]
> This outline is a guide to what you might include in your investor pitch deck. Use your own judgement and ensure you address the points that are most relevant for your startup.

### Company overview

- A one-line description of what your company does.
- A brief summary of current status and key facts to help put the rest of your presentation in context – such as the launch date, current revenues, growth rate, previous funding received, or notable milestones.
- Why are you here? (For example: we're raising a $750,000 seed round.)

### Problem or opportunity

- What is it?
- How serious or real is it?
- How is it currently being solved?
- Why are current solutions inadequate?
- How have you validated the severity of the problem with customers?

### Solution

- How do you solve the problem?
- What's the product?
- Status of development.
- Screenshots, demo, or short (10-15 seconds) video walk-through.
- What's special about it?
- Summarize the company's value proposition.

### Why now?

- Why is now the right time for this idea?
- Is your target market at a tipping point? Is there a technology development (such as machine learning) that has recently made this feasible? Are consumer behaviors changing? Are there new regulatory drivers?
- Why has no one done this before? Is it hard, complex, capital-intensive, or counterintuitive?

### Team

- Who are the key people?
- Demonstrate *founder-market fit*. What's your authentic connection to the problem you're solving? Do you and your cofounders have deep domain knowledge or hands-on experience in this sector? Have you lived and breathed the customer problem you're solving? Is it something that has impacted you personally?
- What have you done before? How do you know you can function well as a team? If you have previous startup experience, what did you learn from it?
- What unique insights do you bring? Why has nobody else seen this opportunity?
- List any existing investors or advisory board members.
- What gaps exist?

### Market

- Addressable market size.
- It's usually better to derive an addressable market figure from the bottom up (for example, we sell our product for \$A, there are B potential customers, so the addressable market is \$A x B) rather than top-down (for example, by referring to a market research report that says the total market is \$X and we hope to capture Y percent).
- Is it a huge existing market that is dominated by old companies and ripe for disruption? Or a nascent market that's about to become huge? Why?

### Validation

- How have you validated your hypotheses?
- Customer hypothesis.
- Problem hypothesis.
- Solution hypothesis.
- (Revenue trumps feedback from customer interviews any day.)

### Revenue model

- How do you make money?
- Unit economics.
- How have you validated pricing with customers?
- Projections and assumptions.

### Customer acquisition

- How do you (or will you) acquire customers?
- Economics – is customer lifetime value (LTV) much larger than the cost of acquiring customers (CAC)?
- What's the rate-limiting factor on growth? (Hopefully it's at least in part access to capital.)

### Competition

- Who are your competitors?
- What are they doing well?
- What are they not doing that you do extremely well?
- How will you compete? Connect back to your unique insights.

### Traction

- What traction have you achieved so far?
- User engagement? Growth? Retention?
- Revenues? Profit?
- Brand-name customers or noteworthy testimonials?

### Plans (next 12-18 months)

- Describe the critical path.
- What milestone will you hit before you run out of money that will enable you to raise more money or become profitable?
- What are the top one or two risks and how are you addressing them?

### Funding round

- How much are you raising?
- What will you use the funds for?
- How much runway does that give you?
- Target close date.
- Any existing investor commitments.
- Other needs (introductions, key hires, advisory board)?

### Closing slide

- Summary – restate the two to three key points that you want the audience to remember.
- Contact details.

### Backup slides

- Any slides that address topics you have predicted are likely to come up as questions (for example, financial forecasts, in-depth competitor analysis, etc.).

## Task: Create a rough investor pitch deck

Create a rough investor pitch deck using the outline above. This is a useful exercise even if you're a long way from being ready to pitch investors. It can help you to think through and articulate the key elements of your business, and by sharing the pitch deck with others (such as mentors) you can get valuable feedback and sanity-check your thinking.

> [!TIP]
> Create the structure of your presentation first, using bullet points to list the key takeaway messages. Then fill in second-order points or supporting information. Once you're happy with the structure, build some PowerPoint slides to match it rather than the other way around. This will lead to a much more coherent and naturally flowing presentation.
