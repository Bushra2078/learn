In this module, we'll look at what makes a startup pitch effective.

## Attributes of a great startup pitch

By analyzing pitches delivered by large numbers of startups, it has been possible to distill down several common themes that emerge from some of the best pitches. Let's discuss some of these themes.

### Clearly explained

- Your audience can gain a clear and unambiguous understanding of what your company does in the first 30-60 seconds.
- Use basic terms rather than jargon or flowery language. For example, "We provide a basic dashboard for banking customers to aggregate all of their bank feeds in one place" would be a better opening statement than "We're an AI-powered financial analytics company that's going to disrupt the consumer banking industry using innovative patented technology."
- If there's a simple and obvious "we're the X for Y," use it here. For example, "Camplify is Airbnb for caravans and motor homes." Don't refer to an X unless you're confident 100 percent of your audience will know who X is.
- It's surprisingly common for the audience to still be unclear about what the company does by the time the founder gets halfway through their investor pitch. This isn't a good situation!

### Engaging start

- Great startup pitches engage the audience in the first 30 seconds and make a clear argument for why this startup needs to exist, why it's solving an important problem, and why you should pay attention for the rest of the pitch. If the founders have a genuine connection to the problem, this is a great time to explain it.
- If you fail to engage the audience in the first 30 seconds, people will get their phones out and check their email, Twitter, or Facebook. This is especially important if you're pitching at a demo day alongside a large number of other startups.
- If you have great traction (or anything else noteworthy), talk about it in the first 60 seconds. There's nothing that gets an investor more excited than telling them you're making money and growing fast.

### Context

- You may have spent the last 10 years of your life deeply immersed in the problem space, but the likelihood is that most of the people in the audience haven't. Generally, you'll need to explain the problem so that your solution, and your entire business model, make sense in context.
- This is particularly important for deep-tech startups or those operating in narrow B2B niches, and less critical for consumer-focused startups.

### Incredulity

- A lot of great startup pitches have an element of incredulity – something that leaves your audience thinking, "I had no idea the problem was this bad. It's amazing that nobody has solved this already!". This can be a nice way to set up your solution.
- For example, if your startup was focused on helping nurses to prepare hospital operating theaters, you might want to start by telling your audience that in X percent of operations there's at least one missing item of essential equipment, and this leads to Y thousand preventable deaths every year. When you tell them about your solution, it will be much more impactful because they can see how important it is that you solve the problem.

### An aha moment

- There's often a point in good startup pitches where your audience has a realization that what you're doing is really exciting. You can help them reach this realization with the use of contrast.
- For example, you might visually show the extent of the problem you're tackling (such as a photo showing how large companies still manage complex, high-risk projects using a whiteboard and sticky notes), and then show the beautiful user interface of your product that will replace this inefficient and archaic method.
- Sometimes startups are based on a unique window of opportunity such as a fundamental change in consumer behavior, technology, or regulatory environment. This change may be obvious to you, but not to your audience. By explaining why this change creates a fantastic window of opportunity for your company, you can help your audience reach an aha moment.

### Structure and flow

- You can help your audience to stay engaged by having a logical structure to your pitch, outlining that structure at the outset, and then delivering that structure.
- For example, at the beginning of your pitch, you might tell your audience that you're going to start by giving them some important context on the problem you're solving. Then you might explain why it's important and no one else has solved it. Next, describe your solution and why your customers are signing up for it, and then cover the business model and traction. Finally, talk about next steps and your funding round.
- As you then step through these elements of the pitch, your audience will remain more engaged because they already have a rough road map in their minds and can see how each part of your pitch flows logically from the last part.
- In contrast, if your pitch jumps around and doesn't follow a logical flow, or isn't in the order your audience is expecting, it will be much more difficult for them to absorb.

## How to make great PowerPoint slides

Besides a sound message, a successful pitch also needs a polished delivery. An effective presentation includes clear, well-designed PowerPoint slides.

### Slides support the message

- Your slides should support the message that you're delivering verbally, not the other way around.
- Focus on communicating your key points verbally, using your slides to support these points with an image, chart, or other single piece of information. One idea per slide.
- It's tempting to try to cram a lot of content into your slides in the hope that they'll convey the key points. However, humans struggle to read and listen at the same time.
- Don't use your slides as a teleprompter – they're there for the audience, not for you.

### Simple and image-rich

- If you have a lot of text or complexity on any of your slides, the audience will unconsciously try to read and make sense of it. They'll stop listening to you, and the important points you're making will be lost on them.
- Simple images are much more effective in supporting the points that you make verbally.

### Large font

- Use a font size that's large enough for everyone in the room to read.
- This is especially important for pitches to large audiences such as at an accelerator demo day. If possible, go to the venue before the event, stand in the back row and step through each of your slides on the screen. If there's anything that's too small to read, you need to make it larger or remove it.
- The same principle applies to online pitches. Verify that everything in your slides is large enough to be read on a typical laptop screen while using whatever video platform will host the demo day.

### Well designed

- The more important the pitch, the more attention should go into getting the design looking polished and consistent with your company's brand.
- If you need the help of a designer, this small investment will more than pay for itself.

### Make your pitch shareable

- If you're pitching at a public event, or one that will be recorded and posted online, make sure to put your name, company name, and website on every slide.
- Doing this will make it easy for people to find out more about your company, and to share it with others.

### Show your product

- If you've built a great product, you should show it in your presentation.
- Experience suggests that the likelihood of a live product demo working is inversely proportional to the importance of the meeting. If you're feeling brave, include a live demo in your pitch, but be prepared with at least one fallback such as a prerecorded video walk-through of your product or a few screenshots.

## How to deliver a compelling pitch

Once you've created your pitch and an accompanying PowerPoint deck, it's time to make sure you can deliver it in as convincing and compelling a way as possible.

Below are some practical tips to help you deliver a great pitch.

### Slow down

- Speak more slowly than you think you should. You're asking your audience to process a large amount of new information, so make it easy for them by talking at a relaxed pace.
- It's much easier to speak slowly when you know that the content you're going to deliver fits easily within the available time. When you're practicing your pitch, ensure you consistently finish comfortably within the allocated time, so you don't feel pressured to rush through it.
- If you have an accent, speak even more slowly and deliberately.

### Project your voice

- All good performers learn how to project their voice, and although delivering a pitch should be more about the content than being theatrical, it's still important to know how to project so you can be heard and understood.

### Exude confidence

- Smile and exude confidence and sincerity (but not so much that it appears manufactured). Smiling not only helps you to appear confident but can actually help you to feel relaxed and confident.
- Knowing the content of your presentation will also make it much easier to feel confident that you can deliver it without any missteps.

### Use inflection

- Great presenters use inflection in their voice to convey meaning and emotion.
- By learning to use variety in the volume, pitch, and timbre of your voice, you'll keep your audience much more engaged.
- Watch this [TED talk by Julian Treasure](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen?azure-portal=true) on how to use your voice to better convey meaning.

### Pause at key moments

- A deliberate pause can help you to underscore important points. It can also give you and your audience an opportunity to gather your thoughts before moving onto the next point.

### Identify and fix bad habits

- Most people have one or more bad habits when presenting. These can include vocal habits such as frequently saying *um* or *you know* or *go right ahead and* or allowing your voice to go up at the end of every sentence as if you're asking a question. They can also be physical habits such as wringing your hands, swaying from side to side, or bouncing up and down on your toes as you speak.
- Bad habits such as these can be distracting for your audience, make you look nervous and unprofessional, and diminish the impact of your presentation.
- Many people are completely unaware they do any of these things, so the first step to fixing bad habits is to identify them. You could practice your pitch in front of some friends and ask them to point out any bad habits or record a video of yourself delivering your pitch and watch it back.
- By consciously practicing your pitch with this in mind, you'll be able to gradually remove these habits and improve your delivery.

### Avoid creating doubt

- If you're delivering a presentation and you say something that your audience doubts, even unconsciously, it [triggers the part of the brain, called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which processes doubt](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2012.00100/full?azure-portal=true). Once activated, this part of the brain remains in a heightened state of activation for several minutes. From this point onward, everything else you say will be processed through this heightened sense of doubtfulness.
- Sometimes it's obvious what triggers doubt in your audience (for example, if you said, "We're building a social media company and we're going head-to-head with Facebook!"), while other times it may not be obvious.
- You can identify non-obvious triggers of doubt by delivering your presentation to someone who's not involved in your startup and asking them to raise their hand immediately they feel themselves experiencing even the smallest feeling of doubt.
- Once you've done this with a few test audiences, you'll be able to identify any points that consistently trigger the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and either modify what you say or provide some supporting evidence immediately following.

### Call out the elephant in the room

- If there's an elephant in the room, you should call it out early in your presentation. For example, let's say one of your cofounders previously founded a company that's now being sued. You should address this at the beginning of the meeting rather than leave your audience to wonder whether or not you're going to talk about it or thinking about whether they should ask you about it.
- Taking it off the table allows everyone to refocus on your presentation rather than wondering about the elephant.

### Leave breadcrumbs

- If there's something you would like your audience to ask you about, make a brief mention of it in your presentation and note that you'd be happy to give more details at the end if time permits.
- This is a technique that's been used by many startups to effectively guarantee the first question they're asked is one that they want and are ready to give a great answer to.

### Anticipate questions

- It should be possible for you to anticipate most of the questions that will come up from investors. This will enable you to have answers at the ready, and perhaps even have a backup slide that addresses the question.
- You can do this by road testing your presentation on a friendly investor audience (such as a mentor who's also been an investor), or even investors that are at the bottom of your investor wish list and making a note of questions that come up frequently.

### Iterate and practice

- The biggest mistake that startup founders make with investor pitches is to  not prepare enough.
- Unless you're an extremely practiced presenter, it's likely that your presentation will improve with each cycle of *deliver* -> *feedback* -> *edit*, and that this will continue asymptotically to around 20 iterations.
- The most useful feedback will come from people who have seen a lot of pitches (such as investors or experienced mentors), and the least useful will come from friends or family.
- Practicing your pitch will help you to memorize it, enabling you to deliver it in a more authentic and relaxed way, rather than using all of your mental energy just to recall the content and delivering a stilted, nervous presentation.
- Practicing also helps you to resist the temptation to continually look behind you at the slides on the screen while you're presenting.
- A good rule of thumb is to test, refine, and improve your presentation at least 10 times before you deliver it to an investor audience, and to do at least one hour of practice for every minute of your pitch.
- Therefore, to prepare a 20-minute investor presentation, you should go through at least 10 iterations and do around 20 hours of practice once you've settled on a final version.
- Try the *slide shuffle game*. Print the slides from your investor presentation. Give them to a friend and ask them to pick out a slide at random and hold it up. You need to start talking immediately about the content that's relevant to that slide. Playing the slide shuffle game is a great way to quickly become familiar with the content in your presentation and learn to think on your feet.
- Some people find that they're tempted to create a script for their entire presentation. This is generally not helpful because very few people can memorize an entire script. When they try to, they inevitably lose their train of thought partway through their presentation, and it can be difficult to regain it. Even if you could memorize a script, it would sound like you're reading something rather than speaking authentically.
- Most people find it's helpful to script the first couple of sentences of a pitch. By doing this and rehearsing them until you could say them in your sleep, you'll be starting your presentation with confidence, knowing exactly what you plan to say at the outset. After the first couple of sentences, you'll relax into a more natural speaking style.

## Task: Review these pitch videos

Following is a selection of pitches from startup demo days to illustrate some of the techniques we've covered in this module. Take a few minutes to watch each pitch video. Make a note of what you like and dislike about each one. Were there any techniques that you think would work well in your own startup pitch?

## Conclusions

- Pitching is a core skill that every startup founder should master. It's important to be able to pitch investors, and these skills also come into play when you explain to customers why they should buy your product and to potential new recruits why they should join your company.
- Compelling startup pitches generally have these attributes in common: clearly explained, engaging start, context, incredulity, an aha moment, structure, and flow.
- A great way to test whether your pitch is on track is to deliver it to someone who knows nothing about your company and ask them to explain back to you what your company does. If they get it 90 percent right, then you're doing a good job. If they struggle, that's a sign that you have more work to do.
