In this module, you'll learn how to pitch your company to people you want to convince that it is worth paying attention to.

Pitching your company simply means explaining the business to certain key people, briefly and compellingly. A pitch can be delivered to potential investors, customers, prospective employees, the media, or other key individuals or groups.

We'll mainly discuss how to pitch to your investors, because they're likely the first and most critical audience you'll have in the life of your company. But the principles we'll cover here also apply to many other scenarios.

The skill of pitching a business doesn't come naturally to most people. You learn it with practice, over time, by developing an understanding of how to convey ideas efficiently and convincingly to an audience.

At the end of this module, you'll look at several example startup pitches and then have an opportunity to apply the techniques you've learned toward building your own pitch.
