In this module, we're going to focus on how to pitch your company.

Pitching simply means explaining your business in a convincing way in a limited amount of time. A pitch can be to an audience of investors, customers, potential employees, the media, and anyone else you need to convince that your company is worth paying attention to.

We'll mainly discuss how to pitch investors, because this is arguably the most critical pitch you'll deliver in the life of your company, but the principles we'll cover apply to many other settings.

Pitching is a vital skill for founders because it's often the first substantive communication you have with investors. It's a skill that doesn't come naturally to most people, but can be learned with time and practice, and by developing an understanding of how to convey ideas efficiently and convincingly to an audience.

At the end of this module, we'll look at several example startup pitches and give you an opportunity to extract learnings and techniques that you can use in building your own pitch.
