Authentication attacks occur when someone tries to steal someone’s credentials so that they can pretend to be that person. Common attacks include, but are not limited to:

- Brute force attack
- Dictionary attack and password spraying
- Credential stuffing
- Keylogging
- Social engineering

### Brute force attack

In a brute force attack, an attacker will attempt to gain access simply by trying different usernames and password combinations, hence the name brute force.  Typically, attackers will use tools that automate this process with the use of millions of username and password combinations. Simple passwords with single-factor authentication are vulnerable to brute force attacks.

### Dictionary attack (or password spraying)

Dictionary attacks are a form of brute force attack, where a dictionary of commonly used words is used for the brute force attack. To prevent dictionary attacks it’s important to use symbols, numbers, and multiple word combinations.

### Credential stuffing

Credential stuffing is an attack method that takes advantage of the fact that many people use the same username and password across many sites. In credential stuffing, attackers will use stolen credentials, usually obtained as a result of a data breach on one site, to attempt to gain access to different sites. Attackers typically use software tools to automate this process. To prevent credential stuffing, it's important not to reuse passwords, change passwords regularly, and change passwords after a security breach.

### Keylogging

Keylogging involves malicious software that logs keystrokes. Using the key logger, an attacker can log (steal) username and password combinations, which can subsequently be used for credential stuffing attacks. To prevent keylogging, do not install untrusted software and use reputable virus-scanning software.

Social engineering**

Social engineering attacks involve an attempt to get people to reveal information or perform an action to enable an attack.

Most authentication attacks involve exploitation of computers or an attempt to try as many credential combinations as possible. Social engineering attacks are different in that they exploit the vulnerabilities of humans. The attacker looks to gain the trust of a legitimate user with the objective of having them divulge information or take an action that enables an attacker to cause damage or steal information.

A number of social engineering techniques can be used for authentication theft, including:

- **Phishing** is a method where the attacker sends a seemingly legitimate email with the objective of having a user reveal their authentication credentials. For example, an email may appear to be from the user’s bank and include a link that opens to what looks to be the bank’s login page but is actually a fake site. When a user logs in at the fake site, the user’s login credentials become available to the attacker. There are several variations of phishing, including spear-phishing, which targets specific organizations, businesses, or individuals.**
- **Pretexting**     is a method where an attacker gains the victim's trust and convinces them to divulge secure information, which can then be used to steal their identity. For example, a hacker might phone up pretending to be calling from your bank and ask for your password to verify your identity.
- **Baiting**     is a form of attack where the attacker offers a fake reward or prize to encourage the victim to divulge secure information.

### Other authentication-based attack methods

These are just a few examples of authentication-based attacks, and there is always the potential for new attack types, but all of the attacks listed above can be prevented by educating users and implementing multifactor authentication.
