Good cybersecurity relies on many factors to provide confidence and assurance that your data is safe and being used as expected.   One of these factors is authentication.  Authentication is the mechanism that lets you trust that someone is who they claim to be. Therefore, to be effective, authentication needs to be robust and not cumbersome to use. 

Once you've authenticated a user, you need to decide what they are permitted to do. Authorization grants each user a specific level of access to data and assets.  As a rule, users should be given just enough permissions to access the resources they need.

If authentication is like the key that opens the door, authorization decides where you can go and what you can see once you are inside.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe authentication.
- Describe some of the common authentication-based attacks.
- Describe authorization security techniques.
