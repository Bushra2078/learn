Good cybersecurity relies on many factors to provide confidence and assurance that your data is safe and being used as expected.   Authentication is one of these factors.  It provides the mechanism for you to trust that someone is actually who they claim to be. To be effective, authentication needs to be robust and not cumbersome to use.

When you've authenticated a user, you need to decide what they're permitted to do. Authorization grants each user a specific level of access to data and assets.  As a rule, users should be given just enough permissions to access the resources they need.

If authentication is the key that opens the door, authorization decides where you can go and what you can see inside.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe authentication.
- Describe some of the common authentication-based attacks.
- Describe authorization security techniques.
