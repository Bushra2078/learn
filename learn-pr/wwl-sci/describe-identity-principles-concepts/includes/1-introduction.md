Everyone, and every device, has an identity that can be used to gain access to resources. Identity is the way in which people and things are identified on your corporate network, and in the cloud.  Being certain about who or what is accessing your organizationâ€™s data and other resources is a fundamental part of securing your environment. This is known as identity and access management and is made up of two key steps: authenticating and authorizing identities.

In this module, you will learn why identity is important in securing corporate resources. At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe the concept of identity as a security perimeter.
- Understand the difference between authentication and authorization.
- Describe identity-related services.
