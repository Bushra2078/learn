You want to send Common Event Format (CEF) log data to the Azure Sentinel workspace using the provided data connector.
  
You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Azure Sentinel.  You need to collect log data from on-premise network appliances.  You can use the Common Event Format connector as the network appliances' data is provided in a structured format.  

You install an on-premise Linux host used as a forwarder to send the log data.  Next, follow the Common Event Format connector page's instructions to run the deployment script on the Linux host.  The final step is to configure the network appliances to forward their logs to your Linux host.  Now the network appliances send logs to the new Linux host; the Linux host is then forwarding the logs to the Azure Sentinel workspace.
  
By the end of this module, you'll be able to send Common Event Format (CEF) log data to the Azure Sentinel workspace using the provided data connector.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the Common Event Format connector deployment options in Azure Sentinel
- Run the deployment script for the CEF connector
