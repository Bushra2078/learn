As more business data is being accessed away from locations outside of the traditional corporate network, security has become an overriding concern. Organizations need to understand how they can best protect their data, regardless of where it's accessed from and whether it sits on their corporate network, or in the cloud.

This module introduces some important security concepts and methodologies. You'll learn about the Zero Trust model, the shared responsibility model, and defense in depth. You'll also cover common cyber security threats. Finally, the module introduces encryption, hashing, and signing as ways to protect data.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the Zero Trust and shared responsibility models.
- Describe common security threats and ways to protect through the defense in-depth security model.
- Describe the concepts of encryption, hashing, and signing.
