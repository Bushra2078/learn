Data has become more important than ever. Organizations, institutions, and entire societies generate and rely on data to function on a day-to-day basis.  The sheer scale of data generated and the increasing reliance on it means that the privacy and protection of that data has become pivotal.  As organizations and institutions move their data to service provider clouds, with datacenters all over the world, additional considerations come into play.

Government agencies and industry groups have issued regulations to help protect and govern the use of data.  From personal and financial information to data protection and privacy, organizations can be accountable for meeting dozens of regulations to be compliant.   Listed below are some important concepts and terms that relate to data compliance.

- **Data residency** - When it comes to compliance, data residency regulations govern the physical locations where data can be stored and how and when it can be transferred, processed, or accessed internationally. These regulations can differ significantly depending on jurisdiction.

- **Data sovereignty** - Another important consideration is data sovereignty, the concept that data, particularly personal data, is subject to the laws and regulations of the country/region in which it's physically collected, held, or processed.  This can add a layer of complexity when it comes to compliance because the same piece of data can be collected in one location, stored in another, and processed in still another; making it subject to laws from different countries/regions.

- **Data privacy** - Providing notice and being transparent about the collection, processing, use, and sharing of personal data are fundamental principles of privacy laws and regulations. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Privacy laws previously referenced "PII" or "personally identifiable information" but the laws have expanded the definition to any data that is directly linked or indirectly linkable back to a person. Organizations are subject to, and must operate consistent with, a multitude of laws, regulations, codes of conduct, industry-specific standards, and compliance standards governing data privacy.  

In most cases, laws and regulations don't define or prescribe specific technologies that organizations must use to protect data. They leave it to an organization to identify compliant technologies, operations, and other appropriate data-protection measures.
