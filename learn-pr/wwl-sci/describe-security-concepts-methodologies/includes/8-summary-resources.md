In this unit you have learned about some important security concepts and methodologies. You have learned about the Zero-Trust methodology, and how the guiding principles of *verify explicitly, least privilege access,* and *assume breach* strengthen security. You learned about the six foundational elements of identity, devices, applications, data, and networks are used in the Zero-Trust model.

This unit also looked at the shared responsibility model, which considers who is responsible for what as organizations migrate their workloads to the cloud. You also learned about defense in depth, and how the security principles of *confidentiality, integrity,* and *availability* help to guide security decisions.

Finally, you learned about common cybersecurity threats including threats to data and personally identifiable information.  

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the Zero-Trust and shared responsibility models.
- Describe common security threats and ways to protect through the defense in depth security model.
- Describe the concepts of encryption, hashing, and signing.
