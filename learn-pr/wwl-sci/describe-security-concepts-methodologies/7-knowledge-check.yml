  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An organization has deployed Microsoft 365 applications to all employees. Who is responsible for the security of the personal data relating to these employees?"
    choices:
    - content: "The organization."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In the shared responsibility model, the customer organization always has responsibility for their data, including personal data relating to employees."
    - content: "Microsoft, the SaaS provider."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The shared responsibility model shows that Microsoft as the cloud provider is responsible for hardware the applications run on. The cloud customer is responsible for data, including personal data."
    - content: "There's shared responsibility between an organization and Microsoft."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The shared responsibility model shows that the cloud customer always retains responsibility for data, including personal data."
  - content: "Which of the following measures might an organization implement as part of the defense in-depth security methodology?"
    choices:
    - content: "Locating all its servers in a single physical location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Distributing the physical location of servers provides added security at the physical layer by mitigating the risk that may come from outages caused by fire, hurricanes, and other disasters."
    - content: "Multi-factor authentication for all users."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Multi-factor authentication is an example of defense in-depth at the identity and access layer."
    - content: "Ensuring there's no segmentation of your corporate network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Splitting a network up into multiple sub-networks provides better layered security and is an example of defense in depth at the network layer."
  - content: "The human resources organization want to ensure that stored employee data is encrypted. Which security mechanism would they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hashing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's  incorrect.  Hashing uses an algorithm to convert the original text to a *unique* fixed-length hash value but it is different to encryption in that it doesn't use keys, and the hashed value isn't subsequently decrypted back to the original."
    - content: "Encryption in transit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's  incorrect.  Encryption in transit is used for encrypting data that is moving from one location to another, not for data that is stored or at rest."
    - content: "Encryption at rest."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Encryption at rest could be part of a security strategy to protect stored employee  data."
  - content: "An organization is moving their IT infrastructure to the cloud. They want to know how to create and implement business and technology strategies in a way that will help them succeed in the cloud. What guidance can they use to help them transition to the cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should use Azure Policy for guidance on moving to the cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "​​​Azure Policy isn’t guidance, but rather a solution that helps ensure resources stay compliant with business and regulatory requirements. Instead, use the Cloud Adoption Framework."
    - content: "They should use the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for guidance on moving to the cloud."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Cloud Adoption Framework has been carefully designed based on cloud adoption best practices from Microsoft employees, customers, and partners. It provides a proven and consistent methodology for implementing cloud technologies.​​​"
    - content: "They should use the Azure Cloud Succeed Framework."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option doesn't exist. Instead, use the Cloud Adoption Framework.​​​"
