  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An organization has deployed Microsoft 365 applications to all employees. Who is responsible for the security of the personal data relating to these employees?"
    choices:
    - content: "The organization."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In the shared responsibility model, the customer organization always has responsibility for their data, including personal data relating to employees."
    - content: "Microsoft, the SaaS provider."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The shared responsibility model shows that Microsoft as the cloud provider is responsible for hardware the applications run on. The cloud customer is responsible for data, including personal data."
    - content: "There's shared responsibility between an organization and Microsoft."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The shared responsibility model shows that the cloud customer always retains responsibility for data, including personal data."
  - content: "Which of the following measures might an organization implement as part of the defense in-depth security methodology?"
    choices:
    - content: "Locating servers at different locations in your organization."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Defense in-depth requires layered security, including physical security. Locating servers at different locations in your organization makes it difficult to provide adequate physical security."
    - content: "Multi-factor authentication for all users."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Multi-factor authentication is an example of defense in-depth at the identity and access layer."
    - content: "Ensuring there's no segmentation of your corporate network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Splitting a network up into multiple sub-networks provides better layered security and is an example of defense in depth at the network layer."
  - content: "The human resources organization want to ensure that stored employee data is encrypted. Which security mechanism would they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Encryption in transit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's  incorrect.  Encryption in transit is used for encrypting data that is moving from one location to another, not for data that is stored or at rest."
    - content: "Digital signing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Digital signing is a mechanism to show that a message has come from the correct sender, and has not been tampered with, making it an inappropriate method to protect the stored data."
    - content: "Encryption at rest."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Encryption at rest could be part of a security strategy to protect stored employee  data."
