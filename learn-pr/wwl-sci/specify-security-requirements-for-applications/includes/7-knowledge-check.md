Tailwind Traders is planning on making some significant changes to their
Application Security Strategy. They have asked for your assistance with
recommendations and questions. Here are the specific requirements.

-   **Application Security Services.**  The Security department would
    like to understand how to evaluate Application Security solutions in
    Azure.

-   **Compliance.** Tailwind Traders wants to know that it follows the
    latest Application Security best practices.

Choose the best response for each of the questions below. Then select
Check your answers.

1.  What can Tailwind Traders do to evaluate if new applications are
    designed progressively?

-   Analyze application components, connections, and relationships using
    threat modelling to identify and mitigate threats. (right)

-   Wrong 1. Use input validation to assess if the application is valid
    and safe. Explanation: Input Validation is a Mitigation method.

-   Wrong 2. Evaluate how the new applications provide access controls
    for resources and operations. Explanation: Input Validation is a
    Mitigation method.

2.  How can Tailwind Traders enforce security assurance for new
    applications in their Azure environment?

-   Securing an application requires security assurances for three
    different component types: application code, application services,
    and application hosting platform. (right)

-   Wrong 1. Use identity for authentication rather than directly
    handling keys. Explanation: This is one of the capabilities that
    should be prioritized first because of the potential security
    impact.

-   Wrong 2. Always authenticate with identity services rather than
    cryptographic keys when available. Explanation: This is one of the
    security guidance to leverage for securing applications in the
    cloud.

3.  What security standard can Tailwind Traders use to secure modern
    applications?

-   Enforce a more comprehensive threat model standard to identify more
    potential risks; two popular standards are STRIDE and OWASP. (right)

-   Wrong 1. User directories and other authentication functions are
    complex to develop and critically important to security assurances.
    Explanation: This is one of the capabilities that should be
    prioritized first because of the potential security impact.

-   Wrong 2. Identify applications that would have a significant impact
    on the business if compromised. Explanation: This is the process of
    identifying and classifying an application with a High Potential
    Impact.
