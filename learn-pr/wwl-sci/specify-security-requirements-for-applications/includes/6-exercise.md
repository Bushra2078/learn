Tailwind Trader is a fictitious home improvement retailer. It operates
retail hardware stores across the globe and online. The Tailwind Traders
CISO is aware of the opportunities offered by Azure but also understands
the need for strong security and solid cloud architecture. Without
strong security and a great point of reference architecture, the company
may have difficulty managing the Azure environment and costs, which are
hard to track and control. The CISO is interested in understanding how
Azure manages and enforces security standards.

### Requirements

Tailwind Traders is planning on making some significant changes to their
Application Security Strategy. Currently, they're using the Waterfall
development cycle to manage all applications. They have asked for your
assistance with recommendations and questions. Here are the specific
requirements.

-   **Security in DevOps.** The company has a new security optimization
    project for customer environments. The CISO wants to ensure that all
    available Applications are secured and controlled in the cloud.

### Tasks

1.  **Evaluate an Application Security Standard**

    -   What could Tailwind Traders do to increase the organization's
        ability to rapidly address security concerns without waiting for
        a longer planning and testing cycle of a waterfall model?

        1.  Evaluate a standard and explain your decision-making
            process.

            -   Tailwind Traders should shift from a 'Waterfall'
                development cycle to a DevOps lifecycle of continuous
                integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) for
                applications, and API development as quickly as
                possible.

    -   What security strategy components could Tailwind Traders use to
        mitigate breaches for new applications deployed in Azure?

        1.  Tailwind Traders should enforce Threat Modeling, Code
            Reviews, Security Testing and optimize their Security
            Development Lifecycle (SDL) for new applications.

How are you enforcing Application Security for all users to protect
their identity, data, and other assets in Microsoft Azure?
