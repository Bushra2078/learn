  title: "Specify security requirements for applications"
  questions:
  - content: "What can Tailwind Traders do to evaluate if new applications are designed progressively?"
    choices:
    - content: "Analyze application components, connections, and relationships using threat modelling to identify and mitigate threats."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use input validation to assess if the application is valid and safe."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Input Validation is a Mitigation method."
    - content: "Evaluate how the new applications provide access controls for resources and operations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Input Validation is a Mitigation method."
  - content: "How can Tailwind Traders enforce security assurance for new applications in their Azure environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Securing an application requires security assurances for three different component types: application code, application services, and application hosting platform."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use identity for authentication rather than directly handling keys."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is one of the capabilities that should be prioritized first because of the potential security impact."
    - content: "Always authenticate with identity services rather than cryptographic keys when available."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is one of the security guidance to use for securing applications in the cloud."
  - content: "What security standard can Tailwind Traders use to secure modern applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enforce a more comprehensive threat model standard to identify more potential risks; two popular standards are STRIDE and OWASP."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "User directories and other authentication functions are complex to develop and critically important to security assurances."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is one of the capabilities that should be prioritized first because of the potential security impact."
    - content: "Identify applications that would have a significant impact on the business if compromised."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is the process of identifying and classifying an application with a High Potential Impact."
