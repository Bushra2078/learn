Transitioning workloads to the cloud involves more than just moving servers, websites, and data. Companies need to think about how to secure those resources, first by identifying authorized users. Next, companies need to ensure that users only have access to data that they need, that they only create services they are authorized to create, and that they only perform operations they are authorized to perform. Access to cloud-based workloads needs to be controlled centrally in two ways: by providing a definitive identity for each user that they use for every service, and by ensuring employees and vendors have enough access to do their jobs.

Azure helps to make these sorts of challenges easier to solve with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the Microsoft cloud-based identity and access management service. Azure AD provides single sign-on and multi-factor authentication to help protect your users and your data. In this module, you will learn the basics of creating, configuring, and managing users and groups of users. You will also learn how to manage licenses.
