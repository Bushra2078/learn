Transitioning workloads to the cloud involves more than just moving servers, websites, and data. Companies need to think about how to secure those resources, identify authorized users, and ensure that data accessed, services created, and operations performed by those users is permitted. Access to cloud-based workloads needs to be controlled centrally by providing a definitive identity for each user that they use for every service and ensuring employees and vendors have just enough access to do their job.

Azure helps to make these sorts of challenges easier to solve with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the Microsoft cloud-based identity and access management service that provides single sign-on and multi-factor authentication to help protect your users and your data. In this module, you will learn the basics of creating, configuring, and managing users and groups of users. In addition, you will learn how to manage licenses.
