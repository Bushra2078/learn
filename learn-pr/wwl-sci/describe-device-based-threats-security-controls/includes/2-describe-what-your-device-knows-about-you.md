Devices are all around us and we depend on them for so many different things.  To service us, devices need to capture, store, and share all kinds of sensitive information about us.  But often, we may not realize the extent to which we use some devices; they’ve become almost invisible to us. In order to protect the sensitive information to which our devices have access, we should be aware of the devices around us, whether we’re using them consciously or subconsciously.

## What are devices?

When you hear the term devices, what's the first thing that comes to mind? You'll probably think about the ones you're familiar with, such as your phone, a laptop, or a tablet. But devices encompass a lot more than this, for example:

- USB drives
- Any device connected to your home network, including always-on home assistance devices, printers, TVs, appliances, door cameras, printers, and more...
- Car dashboard (navigation system, voice control, etc.)
- Wi-Fi hotspots

From our homes to our offices and everywhere in between, we come into contact with devices.

Let’s look at Kayla. At home, she is surrounded by devices. She has devices like her phone, always-on home assistant, tablet, her smart watch, wireless router, and more.

Kayla uses her car to get to work. Her car has built-in devices that she can use while driving, like the navigation system and the wireless access point that allows her car to serve as a mobile hotspot.

At work, Kayla's mobile phone and computer connect wirelessly to her organization's network to access corporate resources, including a network printer. She also uses a USB drive to store certain files and presentations.

In the context of cybersecurity, anything you can touch and/or interact with and can connect to something else can be considered a device. You might be using a device consciously, like when you use your phone, or when you insert a USB drive into your laptop. Or you might be might not realize you are using a device either because a connection happens automatically, like when your phone connects to a Wi-Fi hotspot or because you set it up once and then pretty much forget about it, like the router in your home network.

The takeaway from this is that we should expand what comes to mind when we think about devices. It's important to do this, because in the context of cybersecurity, these can all be considered as threat vectors — targets for cybercriminals who want to cause harm.

## Devices and data

Devices are an integral part of our lives. This is due, in large part to the fact that devices collect and store information but also keep us connected other devices and services.

Think about the convenience of receiving real-time traffic information on your cell phone or the annoyance of getting ads delivered to your device, based on your internet search history. This type of targeted content is sent because our devices, through their applications, collect enormous amounts of information about us, including location information, websites visited, how long we stay on a site, and much more.

Our connected devices also enable us to easily access and share information.  For example, you have probably used your cell phone to share family photos with your friends, access a work document, or to pay for something at a store.

Whether used for work, personal use, or both the information accessible through your devices is often sensitive and private information.  Cybercriminals know this and try to compromise devices as a means to access that data.
