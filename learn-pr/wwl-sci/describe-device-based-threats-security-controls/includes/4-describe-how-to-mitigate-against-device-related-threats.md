We've learned that devices can be threat vectors for cybercriminals because they want to gain access or control of data in order to cause harm. But what can we do protect ourselves?

## Mitigation measures

There are different methods we can use to protect devices and data. Let’s look at two of the most common ones:

### Device hardening

Device hardening is how you minimize the possibility of having device vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
This can be achieved in different ways such as:

- Keep devices up-to-date with the latest security updates
- Turn off any unused devices
- Enable security features supported through the device operating system
- Require PIN or biometrics (such as facial recognition) to access devices

Many modern operating systems have built capabilities that support device hardening. For example, users can enable automatic operating system updates to help protect against known vulnerabilities and ensure continued availability of the device. Additionally, they support security features such as virus and threat protection, and firewall functionality.

You can enable these easily and they can help keep your connected device secure and help maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data accessible through your device.

### Encryption

Encryption is a process the turns information on the device into unintelligible data. The only way to make this information useful is to reverse the encryption. This requires a specific password or key only available to the authorized user. Once the information is encrypted it becomes useless without the right key or password.  This way, the confidentiality of data can be maintained.
There are different ways the contents of a device can be encrypted. For example, some operating systems come with built-in encryption tools that enable you to encrypt your computer’s hard drive or any storage device you connect to it.
