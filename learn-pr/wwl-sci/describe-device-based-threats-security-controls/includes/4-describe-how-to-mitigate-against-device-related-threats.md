We've learned that devices can be threat vectors for cybercriminals because they want to gain access or control of data in order to cause harm. But what can we do protect ourselves?

## Mitigation measures

There are different methods we can use to protect devices and data. Let’s look at a few of the common ones:

### Device hardening

Device hardening is how you minimize the possibility of having device vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
This can be achieved in different ways such as:

- Keep devices up-to-date with the latest security updates
- Turn off any unused devices
- Enable security features supported through the device operating system
- Require PIN or biometrics (such as facial recognition) to access devices

Many modern operating systems have built capabilities that support device hardening. For example, users can enable automatic operating system updates to help protect against known vulnerabilities and ensure continued availability of the device. Additionally, they support security features such as virus and threat protection, and firewall functionality.

You can enable these easily and they can help keep your connected device secure and help maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data accessible through your device.

### Encryption

Encryption is a process the turns information on the device into unintelligible data. The only way to make this information useful is to reverse the encryption. This requires a specific password or key only available to the authorized user. Once the information is encrypted it becomes useless without the right key or password.  This way, the confidentiality of data can be maintained.
There are different ways the contents of a device can be encrypted. For example, some operating systems come with built-in encryption tools that enable you to encrypt your computer’s hard drive or any storage device you connect to it.

### Limit application device access

So far, you've looked at the different ways applications devices can be compromised and some of the steps you can take to mitigate any threats. But, one of the more overlooked attack vectors is someone using the physical device and using your apps directly. 

Suppose you've left your smartphone on your desk and hurried off for an urgent meeting. A bad actor could use your phone to access any apps you have. They could send messages, access your bank accounts, and even make purchases all from your device, using your app. If they're smart, they'd leave the device where they found it, so you would never know.

This can also apply to your work computer, where you're busily working on important and sensitive data and step away from your computer to get yourself a coffee. The unsecured computer can now be used to download sensitive data to a USB drive, or they could look up secret or sensitive data.

In the above to cases, everything the bad actor does will be logged and tracked as if you had done it. So, there is no risk of the bad actor actions being tracked back to them, and you'll have to deal with the fallout and clean-up.

The best way to limit access to your applications is to ensure when you aren't using them, that they're closed or secured. This can be done by locking your device when you step away from it, or if the device is small enough, keeping it with you.
