You’ve learned that devices are all around us, and that they are a source of all kinds of information about us. You’ve also learned that cybercriminals will target devices to get their hands on this information. But how do they do this?

## Devices as threat vectors

While devices help us to get our work done, and go about our day, they also present opportunities to cybercriminals who want to cause harm. This is because they're threat vectors – they provide different ways in which cybercriminals can carry out attacks. For example:

- **Phone, laptop, or tablet** - downloading a malicious app can result in the device being contaminated with malware that can exfiltrate sensitive data stored locally, without the user’s knowledge. This compromises the confidentiality and integrity because the cybercriminal can now view or modify the data.
- **USB drives** – cybercriminals can put malicious software or files on a USB drive. Once inserted into a device such as a laptop, it could, for example, run ransomware, which means the availability of the data has been compromised because it has been locked in return for ransom.
- **Always-on home assistant devices** - these devices are always listening or watching. A cybercriminal can put malicious software on the app stores for these devices. If a user installs it on the device, the cybercriminal can run could perform attacks such as spyware on the device in order to secretly record information, compromising data confidentiality. Or they could move laterally to other devices at home and also compromise their data as well.

## Device vulnerabilities

A device can become compromised because of poor device health, either because they don’t have the latest security updates, or have weak authentication. If such devices connect to a wi-fi hotspot, such as airports, they’re easy targets for attackers who are familiar with the common vulnerabilities of devices and applications and know how to gain unauthorized access.

Once an attacker has access, they can run scripts to install malware.  In most cases, the type of malware, such as back-doors or botnets can persist on the device, even after the device is updated, causing further damage when a user connects the infected device to a work or home networks.

Some users want to gain more control of their devices for customization or other uses. They might resort to *jailbreaking*. Jailbreaking is where a user finds unofficial ways to get full access to the core systems of the device. This makes the device vulnerable, because it may circumvent security measures and offers opportunities for cybercriminals to provide false guidance or software to compromise a device.

To summarize, any connected device has the potential to be a threat vector if it’s not properly secured. Having learned this, we can now begin to think about the different ways in which we can protect our devices.
