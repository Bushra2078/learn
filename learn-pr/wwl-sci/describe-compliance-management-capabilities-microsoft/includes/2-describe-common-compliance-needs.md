Data has become more important than ever.  Organizations, institutions, and entire societies generate and rely on data to function on a day-to-day basis. Any manipulation or loss of data can damage organizations, institutions, and societies alike. The sheer scale of data generated and the increasing reliance on it, means data management has become pivotal.

Governments are working hard to protect people by creating regulations (laws) that are designed to protect data through several measures including:

- Granting individuals the right to access their data at any time.
- Granting individuals the right to correct or delete data about them if needed.
- Introducing retention periods that dictate a minimum or maximum amount of time data should be stored.
- Enabling governments and regulatory agencies the right to access and examine data when necessary.
- Defining rules for what data can be processed and how that should be done.

Some regulations also require that data remains protected even if it’s moved between geographic locations. For example, regulations in some countries require that any personal data transferred outside of their borders meets several conditions including:

- The destination country where personal data is to be transferred must be considered to have adequate protections for the data.
- Organizations must create appropriate safeguards, such as specific clauses that must be included in contracts with organizations or bodies that handle any personal data.

## Common compliance regulations

Some of the regulations that organizations and institutions commonly work with include:

- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** – introduces rules on how health-related information should be protected.
- **The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)** – introduces rules to protect student information.
- **ISO 27701** – specifies rules and guidance to manage personal information, and demonstrate compliance.

Microsoft supports organizations’ compliance needs with built-in tools and capabilities to help them protect information, manage data governance, and respond to regulatory requests.
