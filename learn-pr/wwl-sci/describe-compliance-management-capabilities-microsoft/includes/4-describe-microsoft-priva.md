Privacy is top of mind for organizations and consumers today, and concerns about how private data is handled are steadily increasing. Regulations and laws impact people around the world, setting rules for how organizations store personal data and giving people rights to manage personal data collected by an organization.

To meet regulatory requirements and build customer trust, organizations need to take a "privacy by default" stance. Rather than manual processes and a patchwork of tools, organizations need a comprehensive solution to address common challenges such as:

- Helping employees adopt sound data handling practices and training them to spot and fix issues
- Understanding the potential risks in the amount and type of personal data they store and share
- Fulfilling data subject requests, or subject rights requests, efficiently and on-time

Microsoft Priva helps you meet these challenges so you can achieve your privacy goals. Priva's capabilities are available through two solutions: **Priva Privacy Risk Management**, which provides visibility into your organization's data and policy templates for reducing risks; and **Priva Subject Rights Requests**, which provides automation and workflow tools for fulfilling data requests.

### Priva Privacy Risk Management

Microsoft Priva helps you understand the data your organization stores by automating discovery of personal data assets and providing visualizations of essential information. These visualizations can be found on the overview and data profile pages, currently accessible through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

The overview dashboard provides an overall view into your organizationâ€™s data in Microsoft 365. Privacy administrators can monitor trends and activities, identify and investigate potential risks involving personal data, and springboard into key activities like policy management or subject rights request actions.

The data profile page in Priva provides a snapshot view of the personal data your organization stores in Microsoft 365 and where it lives. It also gives insight into the types of data you store.

Priva evaluates your organization's data stored in the following Microsoft 365 services within your Microsoft 365 tenant:

- Exchange Online
- SharePoint Online
- OneDrive for Business
- Microsoft Teams

Privacy Risk Management in Microsoft Priva also gives you the capability to set up policies that identify privacy risks in your Microsoft 365 environment and enable easy remediation. Privacy Risk Management policies are meant to be internal guides and can help you:

- Detect overexposed personal data so that users can secure it.
- Spot and limit transfers of personal data across departments or regional borders.
- Help users identify and reduce the amount of unused personal data that you store.

### Priva Subject Rights Requests

In accordance with certain privacy regulations around the world, individuals (or data subjects) may make requests to review or manage the personal data about themselves that companies have collected. These requests are sometimes also referred to as data subject requests (DSRs), data subject access requests (DSARs), or consumer rights requests. For companies that store large amounts of information, finding the relevant data can be a formidable task.

Microsoft Priva can help you handle these inquiries through the Subject Rights Requests solution. It provides workflow, automation, and collaboration capabilities for helping you search for subject data, review your findings, collect the appropriate files, and produce reports.
