Compliance score measures progress in completing recommended improvement actions within controls. The score can help an organization to understand its current compliance posture. It can also help organizations to prioritize actions based on their potential to reduce risk.

Admins can get a breakdown of the compliance score in the Compliance Manager overview pane:

## What is the difference between Compliance Manager and compliance score?

Compliance Manager is an end-to-end solution in Microsoft 365 Compliance Center to enable admins to manage and track compliance activities.  Compliance score is a calculation of the overall compliance posture across the organization. The compliance score is available through Compliance Manager. Compliance Manager provides admins with the capabilities to understand and improve their compliance score, so that they can ultimately improve the organization’s compliance posture and help it to stay in line with its compliance requirements.

## How to understand the compliance score

The overall compliance score is calculated using scores that are assigned to actions. Actions come in two types:

- **Your improved actions**: these are actions that the organization is expected to manage.
- **Microsoft actions**: these are actions that Microsoft manages for the organization.

These action types have points assigned to them that count towards the compliance score. Actions can also be considered technical or non-technical, which also affects how they impact the overall compliance score. Additionally, actions are assigned a score value based on whether they’re categorized as mandatory, discretionary, preventative, detective, or corrective:

- **Mandatory** – these are actions that shouldn’t be bypassed. For example, creating a policy to set requirements for password length or expiration.
- **Discretionary** – these are actions that depend on the users understanding and adhering to a policy. For example, a policy where users are required to ensure their devices are locked before they leave their devices.

The following are subcategories of actions that can be classified as mandatory or discretionary:

- **Preventative** actions are designed to handle specific risks, like using encryption to protect data at rest in case of breaches or attacks.
- **Detective** actions are actions that actively monitor systems in order to identify irregularities that could represent risks, or that can be used to detect breaches or intrusions. Examples of these types of actions are system access audits, or regulatory compliance audits.
- **Corrective** actions help admins to minimize the adverse effects of security incidents, by undertaking corrective measures to reduce their immediate effect or possibly even reverse damage.

Actions that are mandatory and preventative, with 27 points, provide the highest point value towards your compliance score.
Organizations accumulate points for every action completed. And the compliance score is shown as a percentage representing all the actions completed compared with those outstanding:
