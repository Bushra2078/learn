The Microsoft 365 compliance center brings together all of the tools and data that are needed to help understand and manage an organization’s compliance needs.

Compliance center is available to customers with a Microsoft 365 SKU with one of the following roles:

- Global administrator
- Compliance administrator
- Compliance data administrator

When an admin signs in to the Microsoft 365 compliance center portal, they’ll get a bird’s-eye view of how the organization is meeting its compliance requirements, along with which solutions can be used to help with compliance, information about any active alerts, and more.

The default compliance center home page contains several cards including:

- The **compliance score** card. This card shows the compliance score, and will forward admins to the Compliance Manager where they can see a breakdown of the compliance score.  Compliance score measures the progress in completing recommended improvement actions within controls. The score helps an organization to understand its current compliance posture. It also helps an organization to prioritize actions based on their potential to reduce risk.

- The new **Solution catalog** card, links to collections of [integrated solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-solution-catalog?view=o365-worldwide) that are used to manage end-to-end compliance scenarios across three compliance solutions areas:
  - The **Information protection & governance** section quickly shows you how to use Microsoft 365 compliance solutions to protect and govern data in your organization.
  - The **Insider risk management** section on the home page shows how your organization can identify, analyze, and act on internal risks before they cause harm.
  - The **Discovery & respond section** on the home page shows how your organization can quickly find, investigate, and respond to compliance issues with relevant data.

  A solution's capabilities and tools might include a combination of policies, alerts, reports, and more.

## Navigation

In addition to the cards on the home page, there’s a navigation pane on the left of the screen that gives easy access to [alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/alerts?view=o365-worldwide), [reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/reports-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide), [policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/alert-policies?view=o365-worldwide), compliance solutions, and more.
