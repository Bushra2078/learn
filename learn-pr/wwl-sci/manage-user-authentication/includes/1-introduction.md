One of the main features of an identity platform is to verify, or authenticate, credentials when a user signs in to a device, application, or service. In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), authentication involves more than just verifying a username and password. To improve security and reduce the need for help desk assistance, Azure AD authentication includes the following components:

 -  Self-service password reset
 -  Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication
 -  Hybrid integration to write password changes back to on-premises environment
 -  Hybrid integration to enforce password protection policies for an on-premises environment
 -  Passwordless authentication

This module examines these components and explains how to plan, implement, and manage user authentication in Azure AD.
