Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) self-service password reset (SSPR) gives users the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or help desk involvement. If a user's account is locked or they forget their password, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work. This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user can't sign in to their device or an application.

## Benefits of using self-service password reset

There are many benefits for the user and the organization to enabling self-service password reset:
- Users can reset their own password - no productivity loss
- No admin / IT intervention - enables IT to focus on bigger issues

Note that a user has to be enrolled into self-service password reset, and that a Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license or an Microsoft 365 Business license is required.
