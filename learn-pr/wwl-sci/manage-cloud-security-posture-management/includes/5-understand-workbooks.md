Azure Monitor Workbooks provide a flexible canvas for data analysis and the creation of rich visual reports within the Azure portal. They allow you to tap into multiple data sources from across Azure, and combine them into unified interactive experiences.

Within Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can access the built-in workbooks to track your organizationâ€™s security posture. You can also build custom workbooks to view a wide range of data from Defender for Cloud or other supported data sources.
