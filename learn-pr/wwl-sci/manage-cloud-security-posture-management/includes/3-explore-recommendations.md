Defender for Cloud's recommendations are based on the Azure Security Benchmark. Azure Security Benchmark is the Microsoft-authored, Azure-specific set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices based on common compliance frameworks. This widely respected benchmark builds on the controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a focus on cloud-centric security.  Other recommendations are generated from regulator compliance initiatives.

## Remediation steps
Recommendations give you suggestions on how to better secure your resources. You implement a recommendation by following the remediation steps provided in the recommendation.

After reviewing all the recommendations, decide which one to remediate first. We recommend that you prioritize the security controls with the highest potential to increase your secure score.

1. From the list, select a recommendation.

1. Follow the instructions in the Remediation steps section. Each recommendation has its own set of instructions. 

1. Once completed, a notification appears informing you whether the issue is resolved.

### Fix button
To simplify remediation and improve your environment's security (and increase your secure score), many recommendations include a Fix option.

To implement a Fix:

1. From the list of recommendations that have the Fix action icon, select a recommendation.

1. From the Unhealthy resources tab, select the resources that you want to implement the recommendation on, and select Remediate.

1. In the confirmation box, read the remediation details and implications.
