Throughout this module, you've learned about concepts like cyberattacks, cybersecurity, the threat landscape, malware, and how to mitigate against cyberattacks.

You've learned that cybercriminals use cyberattacks to gain illegal access or control over devices, systems, and data. In this way, they can compromise the confidentiality of information, the integrity of information, or the availability of information (the CIA model).

You've seen that cybersecurity is how you protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. This is because cybersecurity enables you to implement mitigation strategies that you can use to protect against cyberattacks.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the basic threat landscape
- Describe different types of malware
- Describe basic mitigation strategies
