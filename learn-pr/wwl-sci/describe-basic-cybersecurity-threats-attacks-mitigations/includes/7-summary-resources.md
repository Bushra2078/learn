In this module, you've learned about concepts like cyberattacks, cybersecurity, the threat landscape, and malware. You've also seen how to mitigate against cyberattacks.

You've learned that cybercriminals use cyberattacks to gain illegal access to, or control over, devices, systems, and data. They can then compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information (the CIA model).

Also, you've seen that cybersecurity is how you protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. This is because cybersecurity enables you to implement mitigation strategies that you can use to protect against cyberattacks.

Now you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the basic threat landscape.
- Describe different types of malware.
- Describe basic mitigation strategies.
