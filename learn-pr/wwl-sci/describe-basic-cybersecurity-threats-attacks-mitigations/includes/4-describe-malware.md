You've heard about terms like malware, viruses, worms, and so on. But what do these things mean? Is a virus a worm? What does malware do exactly? These are just some of the basic concepts you’ll learn about in this unit.

## What is malware?

Malware comes from the combination of the words malicious and software. It’s a piece of software used by cybercriminals to infect systems and carry out actions that will cause harm, such as stealing data or disrupting normal usage and processes in some way.

Malware has two main components:

- Propagation mechanism
- Payload

### What is a propagation mechanism?

Propagation is how the malware spreads itself across one or more systems. Here are a few examples of common propagation techniques.

#### Virus

Most of us are already familiar with this term. But what does it actually mean? First, let’s think about viruses in non-technical terms.  In biology, for example, a virus enters the human body through some means. Once inside the body, the virus can spread and cause harm.  Accordingly, technology-based viruses depend on some means of entry, specifically a user action, to enter a system.  Once inside, the virus spreads and can cause harm.  For example, a user might download a file or plug in a USB device that contains the virus, contaminating the system (you now have a security breach).

#### Worm

In contrast to a virus, a worm doesn't need any user action to spread itself across systems. Instead, a worm causes damage by finding vulnerable systems it can exploit.  Once inside the system, the worm can spread to other connected systems. For example, a worm may infect a device by exploiting a vulnerability in an application running on the device.  Once the device is infected, the worm can spread across other devices in the same network and other connected networks.

#### Trojan

A trojan is a type of malware that pretends to be a genuine piece of software. For example, if a user installs the program, it can pretend to be working as advertised, but the program also secretly performs malicious actions such as stealing information or other harmful actions.

### What is a payload?

The payload is the action that a piece of malware performs on an infected device or system. Here are some common types of payloads:

- **Ransomware** is a payload that locks systems or data until the victim has paid a ransom to unlock it. Suppose there is an unidentified vulnerability in a network of connected devices. A cybercriminal can exploit this vulnerability to gain access and then encrypt all files across this network of connected devices. The attacker then demands a ransom in return for decrypting the files or threatens to remove all of the files if the ransom hasn't been paid by the deadline they choose.
- **Spyware** is a type of payload that spies on a device or system. For example, the malware may install keyboard scanning software on a user's device, collect password details, and transmit them back to the attacker, all without the user's knowledge.  
- **Backdoors**: A backdoor is a payload that enables a cybercriminal to exploit a vulnerability in a system or device to bypass existing security measures in order to cause harm. Imagine that a cybercriminal infiltrates a software developing company and leaves in some code that allows the cybercriminal to carry out attacks through the software. This becomes a backdoor that the cybercriminal could use to hack into the application, the device it's running on, and even the organization and customer's networks and systems.
- **Botnet** is a type of payload that joins a computer, server, or another computing device to a network of similarly infected devices that can be controlled remotely for the purpose of some nefarious action. A common application of Botnet malware is crypto-mining (often referred to as crypto-mining malware). In this case, the malware connects a device to a botnet that consumes the device's computing power to mine or generate cryptocurrencies.  A user may notice their computer is running slower than normal and getting worse by the day.
