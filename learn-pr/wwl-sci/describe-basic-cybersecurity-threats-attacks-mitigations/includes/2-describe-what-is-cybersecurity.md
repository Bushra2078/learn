People, organizations, and even governments are routinely falling victim to cyberattacks. We constantly hear references to concepts like cybersecurity, cyberattacks, cybercriminals, and more. All of this can sound daunting and hard to grasp. To protect yourself and those around you, you'll need to have a basic understanding of these concepts.

## What is a cyberattack?

A cyberattack is commonly defined as an attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system for the purpose of causing damage or harm. But thinking of just computers or computer systems, in a traditional sense, is limiting. The reality is that a cyberattack can occur on almost any modern digital device, and the impact can range from a mere inconvenience for an individual to global economic and social disruption.

An attacker can use people, computers, phones, applications, messages, and system processes to carry out an attack. As a result, individuals, organizations, institutions, and even governments can be victims of an attack. Attacks can operate in various ways. For example, an attack can:

- Lock data and processes, and demand ransom in return.
- Remove vital information to cause serious harm.
- Steal information.
- Publicly expose private information.
- Stop vital business processes and systems from running to cause disruption and malfunction.

Cyberattacks continuously evolve. The important takeaway from this is that you keep in mind that attackers don't exclusively need to use a computer to carry out an attack and that attacks can vary widely in their nature and scope. Any digitally connected device or entity can be used as part of an attack or be subject to an attack.

## What is a cybercriminal?

A cybercriminal is anyone who carries out cyberattacks. Cybercriminals can be:

- A single person or a group of people.
- An organization for hire.
- A government entity.

Cybercriminals can be located anywhere, including embedded inside an organization or institution, to cause damage from within.

## What is cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity refers to technologies, processes, and training that help protect systems, networks, programs, and data from cyberattacks, damage, and unauthorized access. Cybersecurity enables you to achieve the following goals:

- **Confidentiality**: Information should only be visible to the right people.
- **Integrity**: Information should only be changed by the right people or processes.
- **Availability**: Information should be visible and accessible whenever needed.

This is commonly referred to as the *Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability* (CIA) model in the context of cybersecurity.  Throughout the rest of this module, you will learn about the types of attacks that cybercriminals use to disrupt these goals and cause harm and basic threat mitigation strategies.
