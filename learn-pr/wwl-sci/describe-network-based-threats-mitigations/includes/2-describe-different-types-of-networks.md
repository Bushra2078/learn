In todayâ€™s modern world, networks exist everywhere. Home networks connect your laptop, computer, TV, gaming console, smartphones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, allowing them to communicate with each other and the internet. In a business, whether a humble organization running out of a garage to the largest enterprises, networks are the backbone that allows them function and share data, ideas, and resources.

Networks are used to access information of every kind from the pictures you share with your friends, to the sensitive information like bank and credit card transactions. When you use the banking application on your mobile device, it uses multiple networks to get to your bank, and then you navigate the banks network to get to your details.

### What is a network

A network is a grouping of interconnected physical components that work together to provide a seamless backbone for all your devices to communicate. Even the cloud and the internet whilst seem intangible has physical roots. While there are dozens of parts that help define a network, the ones you're more likely to encounter are: routers, switches, firewalls, access points, and hubs. While most of these are outside the scope of this unit, two are worth calling out.

- The **switch** is the fundamental building block of a modern network allowing multiple devices to communicate with each other.
- The **router** allows different networks to communicate with each other.

While you may have heard of different types of networks, for instance wireless networks, local area networks, and more; fundamentally all networks fall into one of these two categories:

- A **private network** is one where a level of authentication and authorization is required to access devices and resources inside the network. As you might find in your place of work.
- A **public network** is open to any user. The internet is an example of a public network.

### Connect to your network

Regardless of the type of network you're using, there are several different ways that you can connect to it.

- The **Wired** or **Ethernet** connection is still the most common way of connecting to an office network and requires a physical network cable to connect your computer or laptop to a switch in your network.
- A **Wireless** connection lets your device connect to the network using wi-fi. This is typically used at home or in large public venues.
- A **Bluetooth** connection a short-range device to device communication method. Bluetooth devices tend to be small like pedometers, Bluetooth headphones, smart watches, etc.

### The client-server topology

While networks allow devices or apps on the devices to communicate with each other, one of the most common network implementations is called the client-server topology. In this model, the client can be one or more devices or applications on a device that wants to do something, and the server is responsible for processing each client request and sending back a response.

An example of the client-server model is when you use your smart phone or tablet to access a digital streaming service. Your device is the client, making a request to the streaming server to access the movie or tv show you want to watch. The server responds by streaming the content to your device. Another example is when you use your browser to access content from the internet.
