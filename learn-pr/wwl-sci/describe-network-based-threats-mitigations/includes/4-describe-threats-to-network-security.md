Networks are the backbone of our modern world, enabling us to communicate, shop, play, and work from anywhere. They allow access to a vast amount of information not only about ourselves, but for businesses. That makes them a prime target for cybercriminals who see information as the new currency. Weak network security risks exposing sensitive critical data and, damaging the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data being stored.

Understanding the threats that face your network is a key part of building a strong security network.

### Common network attacks

Networks can be attacked in various different ways and there are far too many to cover here. Here are the more common ones:

- **Man-in-the-middle or eavesdropping attacks** – this type of attack can occur when cybercriminals compromise or emulate routes in the network, allowing them to intercept the packets of information. You can think of this as a form of wiretapping. This allows attackers to not just steal data but also compromise the integrity of the data.
- **Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks** – the objective of a DDoS attack is to compromise the availability of the targeted network or service. Attackers do this by bombarding the targeted network or service with millions of simultaneous requests, from sources that are distributed across the network, overwhelming it and causing it to crash.

In this short minute and a half video, you'll see a simulation of how each of these attacks work. For the man-in-the-middle attack, to keep it simple, we've chosen to only use one route. With the distributed denial of service attack, hundreds of thousands or even tends of millions of computers are used. Again for simplicity, we're only shown a handful.

### Common DNS attack

A DNS attack looks to exploit weaknesses in the DNS server because they're designed for efficiency and usability, and not with security in mind. A common DNS attack is **DNS poisoning**. DNS poisoning is where the attacker changes the IP addresses in the DNS lookup tables to divert traffic from a legitimate site to a bad site that may contain malicious links or other malware.

### Common wireless attacks

Wireless networks allow our devices to seamlessly connect to networks everywhere. In your home, the wireless network allows your smartphone, always-on IoT devices to connect to the internet. The broad availability of these networks makes them the perfect target for cybercriminals. There are many different ways to attack a wireless network:

- **Wardriving** - The term Wardriving was popularized by a couple of 80s movies. But it consists of the attacker searching for unsecured wireless networks with vulnerabilities. They typically operate from vehicle. Most wardriving attacks seek to use your network for criminal activities, like hacking other computers and it could steal personal information.
- **Spoofing wi-fi hotspots** - This is similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker uses their laptop, or a device connected to it, to offer a network access point that mimics a genuine access point. For example, if you're in a coffee shop and you're looking to access the internet using their guest wi-fi, you might see a couple of access points that have the coffee shop name. But one of those could be from a bad actor. Once you've connected to the bogus access point, anything you do over the network can be intercepted. It also allows the cybercriminal to direct you to bad websites or capture your private data.

### Bluetooth attack

There has been a growth in Bluetooth devices, from smart watches and audio devices to device-to-device communication. Attacking Bluetooth networks is less common than attacks on wireless networks, mostly because the attacker needs to be with range of your device, but it's still a valid attack vector. A typical Bluetooth attack is **Bluejacking**.  Bluejacking is where an attacker can send unsolicited messages to any Bluetooth-enabled device within the attacker own device’s range. Think of Bluejacking like someone ringing your doorbell and then running away before you can answer the door. It's mostly an annoyance.
