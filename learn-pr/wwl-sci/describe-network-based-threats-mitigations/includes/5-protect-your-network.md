Protecting your networks is an essential part of a robust network security policy. As you saw in the previous unit, there are numerous ways in which a network can be attacked. There is no single solution that will protect your network; however, the majority of these network attacks can be mitigated by using a combination of hardware and software solutions.

### How a firewall protects your network

A firewall is typically the first line of defense in your network. It's a device that sits between the Internet and your network and filters all traffic coming in and going out of the network. A firewall can be either software or hardware based, and for the best protection it's good have both types. A firewall monitors incoming and outgoing traffic. Using security rules, it will keep out unfriendly traffic, while allowing authorized traffic to pass freely.

### Maintaining a healthy network using antivirus

Viruses come in all shapes and sizes and none of them are good for the devices and servers that use your network. Cybercriminals can use them for many purposes, from obtaining user credentials so they can access your network, to more harmful types that encrypt all the data on a device or server unless you pay vast sums of money. Much like your body will fight off a virus when it gets infected, computers can also be protected by using Antivirus software. Once antivirus software is installed it will run in background, scanning all data arriving on the device. When it detects a virus, it will automatically delete it, to prevent the user from accidentally running it.

You can now get antivirus for most of your devices, including servers, computers, tablets, smartphones, and any other internet-connected devices.

### Improve authentication using network access control

While a firewall can keep unwanted devices from accessing your network, you still need to exercise control over the devices that you do want to use your network. Network access control (NAC) is a security solution that controls device and user access through strict policy enforcement. Policies on a device control what the device can do on the network and can limit what the user is able to do on a device. Through network access control, you can improve your network security by requiring all users adopt multifactor authentication in order to sign into the network. Network access control allows you to define the devices and users that can access network assets, reducing threats and stopping unsanctioned access.

### Split your network into parts

In your home, you have different rooms, each with a different purpose, for example the kitchen, the lounge, the dining room, a study, one or more bedrooms, and some bathrooms. You can control access to each of these rooms by attaching digital locks to all the doors. As a guest arrives, you can grant them a key that permits them access to specific rooms in your home. You can do the same kind of thing with your network using the concept of network segmentation. Network segmentation creates boundaries around critical operations or assets, much the same way as you'd put your finance team in their own office. Network segmentation improves the integrity of your network assets by ensuring that even if your network is breached, the attacker shouldn't be able to get into the segmented areas.

### Secure connections using a Virtual Private Network

A Virtual Private Network or VPN serves as dedicated and secure connection across the Internet, between a device and a server. A VPN connection encrypts all your internet traffic and then disguises it so that it's impossible to know the identity of the original device. This type of secure connection makes it difficult for cybercriminals to track your activities and obtain your data. If you've ever connected to your work network from public wi-fi hotspot, such as airport, you most likely used a VPN. The VPN establishes a secure connection over an insecure public network. VPN providers have become very common not just for remote work scenarios but for personal use as well.

### Encrypt your wireless network

Whether you're setting up a wireless access point in your home or place of work, enabling encryption is critical to protecting against attacks. Wi-fi protected access 2 or WPA2 is the most commonly used wi-fi encryption method in use at this time. It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to secure the connection.
