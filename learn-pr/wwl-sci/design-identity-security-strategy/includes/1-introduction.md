The content in the module will help you prepare for Exam SC-100:
Cybersecurity Architecture. The module concepts are covered in:

-  Design a Zero Trust Strategy and Architecture
-  Design an Identity Security Strategy

## Prerequisites

-   Conceptual knowledge of security policies, requirements, zero trust architecture, and management of hybrid environments.
-   Working experience with zero trust strategies, applying security policies, and developing security requirements based on business goals.

## Identity Security Strategy Overview

The term Identity Security Strategy defines the general process of
authenticating and authorizing security principals for an organization.
It also involves controlling information about those principals
(identities). Security principals (identities) may include services,
applications, users, groups, etc. Microsoft identity and access
management solutions help IT protect access to applications and
resources across the corporate datacenter and into the cloud. Such
protection enables additional levels of validation, such as Multi-Factor
Authentication and Conditional Access policies.

A good Identity Security Strategy helps maintain control over the
applications and resources that are managed in the cloud. Maintaining
control over your environment ensures compliancy with:

-   Industry standards, such as information security management.
-   Corporate or organizational standards, such as ensuring that network data is encrypted.

An efficient Security Strategy and Architecture is most beneficial when
there are:

-   Multiple engineering teams working in Azure.
-   Multiple subscriptions to manage.
-   Regulatory requirements that must be enforced.
-   Standards that must be followed for all cloud resources.
-   Defined secure authentication and authorization strategy.
