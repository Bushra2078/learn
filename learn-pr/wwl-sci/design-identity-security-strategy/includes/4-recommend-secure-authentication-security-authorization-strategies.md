### **Recommend a Secure Authentication & Authorization Strategy**

Choosing the correct authentication method is the first concern for
organizations wanting to move their apps to the cloud. Don\'t take this
decision lightly for the following reasons:

1.  It's the first decision for an organization that wants to move to
    the cloud.

2.  The authentication method is a critical component of an
    organization\'s presence in the cloud. It controls access to all
    cloud data and resources.

3.  It's the foundation of all the other advanced security and user
    experience features in Azure AD.

Identity is the new control plane of IT security, so authentication is
an organization\'s access to the new cloud world. Organizations need an
identity control plane that strengthens their security and keeps their
cloud apps safe from intruders.

**Secure Authentication methods**

When the Azure AD hybrid identity solution is your new control plane,
authentication is the foundation of cloud access. Choosing the correct
authentication method is a crucial first decision in setting up an Azure
AD hybrid identity solution. Implement the authentication method
configured by using Azure AD Connect, which also provisions users in the
cloud.

To choose an authentication method, consider the time, existing
infrastructure, complexity, and cost of implementing your choice. These
factors are different for every organization and might change over time.

Azure AD supports the following authentication methods for hybrid
identity solutions.

**Cloud authentication**

When choosing this authentication method, Azure AD handles users\'
sign-in process. Coupled with seamless single sign-on (SSO), users can
sign into cloud apps without re-entering their credentials. With cloud
authentication, there are two options:

**Azure AD password hash synchronization**. The simplest way to enable
authentication for on-premises directory objects in Azure AD. Users can
use the same username and password that they use on-premises without
deploying any additional infrastructure. Some premium features of Azure
AD, like Identity Protection and [Azure AD Domain
Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance),
require password hash synchronization, no matter which authentication
method is chosen.

**Azure AD Pass-through Authentication**. Provides a simple password
validation for Azure AD authentication services by using a software
agent that runs on one or more on-premises servers. The servers validate
the users directly with your on-premises Active Directory, ensuring that
the password validation doesn\'t happen in the cloud.

Companies with a security requirement to immediately enforce on-premises
user account states, password policies, and sign-in hours might use this
authentication method. For more information on the actual pass-through
authentication process, see [User sign-in with Azure AD pass-through
authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-pta).

**Federated authentication**

Azure AD hands off the authentication process to a separate trusted
authentication system when choosing this authentication method. An
example is on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to
validate the user\'s password.

The authentication system can provide additional advanced authentication
requirements. Examples are smartcard-based authentication or third-party
multifactor authentication. For more information, see [Deploying Active
Directory Federation
Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/windows-server-2012-r2-ad-fs-deployment-guide).

The following section helps determine which authentication method is
right using a decision tree. It helps determine whether to deploy a
cloud or federated authentication for an Azure AD hybrid identity
solution.

required for each authentication method that can be used with an Azure
AD hybrid identity solution.

**Secure Authorization Methods**

Authorization verifies that the identity attempting to connect has the
necessary permissions to access a service, feature, function, object, or
method. Authorization always occurs after successful authentication. If
a connection isn't authenticated, it fails before any authorization
checking is performed. If authentication of a connection succeeds, a
specific action might still be disallowed because the user or group did
not have the authorization to perform that action.

Administrators benefit from understanding the following authorization
methods to enforce Zero Trust. To learn more about these authorization
methods, see [Get started with permissions, access, and security
groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/about-permissions?view=azure-devops).

**Authorization Methods**

-   Security group membership

-   Role-based access control

-   Access levels

-   Feature flags

-   Security namespaces & permissions
