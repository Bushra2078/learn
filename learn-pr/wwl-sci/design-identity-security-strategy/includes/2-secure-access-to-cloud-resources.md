Cloud applications and the mobile workforce have redefined the security
perimeter. Employees are bringing their own devices and working
remotely. Data is accessed outside the corporate network and shared with
external collaborators such as partners and vendors. Corporate
applications and data are moving from on-premises to hybrid and cloud
environments. Organizations can no longer rely on traditional network
controls for security. Controls need to move to where the data is: on
devices, inside apps, and with partners.

Identities representing people, services, or IoT devices, are the common dominator across today's many [networks](https://aka.ms/ZTNetwork), [endpoints](https://aka.ms/ZTDevices), and [applications](https://aka.ms/ZTApplications). In the Zero Trust security model, they function as a powerful, flexible, and granular way to control access to [data](https://aka.ms/ZTData).

Before an identity attempts to access a resource, organizations must:

- Verify the identity with strong authentication.
- Ensure access is compliant and typical for that identity.
- Follows least privilege access principles.

Once the identity has been verified, we can control that identity's access to resources based on organization policies, ongoing risk
analysis, and other tools.

### Identity Zero Trust deployment objectives

Before most organizations start the Zero Trust journey, their approach to identity is problematic in that the on-premises identity provider is
in use, no SSO is present between cloud and on-premises apps, and [visibility](https://aka.ms/ZTCrossPillars) into identity risk is very limited.


When implementing an end-to-end Zero Trust framework for identity, we recommend focusing first on these initial deployment objectives:

* [I. Cloud identity federates with on-premises identity systems](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity#i-cloud-identity-federates-with-on-premises-identity-systems)
* [II. Conditional Access policies gate access and provide remediation activities](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity#ii-conditional-access-policies-gate-access-and-provide-remediation-activities)
* [III. Analytics improve visibility](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity#iii-analytics-improve-visibility)

After these are completed, focus on these additional deployment objectives:

* [IV. Identities and access privileges are managed with identity governance](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity#iv-identities-and-access-privileges-are-managed-with-identity-governance)
* [V. User, device, location, and behavior are analyzed in real time to determine risk and deliver ongoing protection](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity#v-user-device-location-and-behavior-is-analyzed-in-real-time-to-determine-risk-and-deliver-ongoing-protection).
* [VI. Integrate threat signals from other security solutions to improve detection, protection, and response](/security/zero-trust/deploy/identity#vi-integrate-threat-signals-from-other-security-solutions-to-improve-detection-protection-and-response).

### Identity Zero Trust deployment guide

This guide walks through the steps required to manage identities following the principles of a Zero Trust security framework.

#### I. Cloud identity federates with on-premises identity systems

Azure Active Directory (AD) enables strong authentication, a point of integration for endpoint security, and the core of your user-centric policies to guarantee least-privileged access. Azure AD's Conditional Access capabilities are the policy decision point for access to resources based on user identity, environment, device health, and risk---verified explicitly at the point of access. We will show how to implement a Zero Trust identity strategy with Azure AD.

#### II. Conditional Access policies gate access and provide remediation activities

Azure AD Conditional Access (CA) analyzes signals such as user, device, and location to automate decisions and enforce organizational access policies for the resource. Use CA policies to apply access controls like multi-factor authentication (MFA). CA policies allow for prompting users for MFA when needed for security and stay out of users way when not needed.

Planning your Conditional Access policies in advance and having a set of active and fallback policies is a foundational pillar of your Access
Policy enforcement in a Zero Trust deployment. Take the time to configure your trusted IP locations in your environment. Even if they
are not used in a Conditional Access policy, configuring these IPs informs the risk of Identity Protection mentioned above.

#### III. Analytics improve visibility

As you build your estate in Azure AD with authentication, authorization, and provisioning, it's important to have strong operational insights
into what is happening in the directory.

To configure your logging and reporting to improve visibility, take this step: [Plan an Azure AD reporting and monitoring deployment](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/plan-monitoring-and-reporting) to be able to persist and analyze logs from Azure AD, either in Azure or using a SIEM system of choice.

#### IV. Identities and access privileges are managed with identity governance

Once the initial three objectives are accomplished, focus on additional
objectives such as more robust identity governance.

#### V. User, device, location, and behavior are analyzed in real time to determine risk and deliver ongoing protection

Real-time analysis is critical for determining risk and protection.

#### VI. Integrate threat signals from other security solutions to improve detection, protection, and response

Finally, other security solutions can be integrated for greater effectiveness.

Integration with Microsoft Defender for Identity enables Azure AD to know that a user is indulging in risky behavior while accessing on-premises, non-modern resources (like file shares). This can then be factored into overall user risk. High user risk might lead to blocking further access in the cloud.
