Custom detection rules built from advanced hunting queries let you proactively monitor various events and system states, including suspected breach activity and misconfigured devices.  For more information on creating custom detections, see Create detection rules in the Manage Alerts and Incidents in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint module.

**View existing rules**

To view all existing custom detection rules, navigate to Settings > Custom detections. The page lists all the rules with the following run information:

- Last run—when a rule was last run to check for query matches and generate alerts

- Last run status—whether a rule ran successfully

- Next run—the next scheduled run

- Status—whether a rule has been turned on or off

**View rule details, modify rule, and run rule**

To view comprehensive information about a custom detection rule, select the name of rule from the list of rules in Settings > Custom detections. A page about the selected rule displays the following information:

- General information about the rule, including the details of the alert, run status, and scope

- List of triggered alerts

- List of triggered actions

You can also take the following actions on the rule from this page:

- Run—run the rule immediately. This action also resets the interval for the next run.

- Edit—modify the rule without changing the query

- Modify query—edit the query in advanced hunting

- Turn on / Turn off—enable the rule or stop it from running

- Delete—turn off the rule and remove it
