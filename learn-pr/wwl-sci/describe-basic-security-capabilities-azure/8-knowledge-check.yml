  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "The security admin has created an Azure Network Security Group (NSG) to filter network traffic to a virtual machine.  The admin wants to allow inbound traffic using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), but the default NSG rules are currently blocking all inbound traffic that is not from another virtual network or an Azure load balancer.  What does the security admin have to do to allow inbound traffic using RDP?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete the default rule."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The default rules cannot be deleted."
    - content: "Create a new network security rule that allows RDP traffic and that has a higher priority than the default rule."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct.  You can create a new rule to allow RDP that has a higher priority than the default rule"
    - content: "There is nothing the admin can do, RDP traffic is not supported with NSGs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. NSG rules can be set allow RDP traffic"
  - content: "The security admin wants to protect Azure resources from DDoS attacks, which Azure DDoS Protection tier will the admin use to target Azure Virtual Network resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Basic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Basic service tier provides always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks provide the same defenses that Microsoft’s online services use."
    - content: "Standard."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Standard service tier provides additional mitigation capabilities that are tuned specifically to Microsoft Azure Virtual Network resources."
    - content: "Advanced."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure DDoS Protection is available in only two tiers. Advanced is not a valid tier."
  - content: "An organization has several virtual machines in Azure. The security admin wants to deploy Azure Bastion to get secure access to those VMs. What should the admin keep in mind?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per virtual network, with support for virtual network peering."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Bastion deployment is per virtual network with support for virtual network peering, not per subscription/account or virtual machine."
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Bastion deployment isn't per subscription/account."
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Bastion deployment isn't per virtual machine."
  - content: "An organization has much of its application data in Azure. The security admin wants to use the encryption capabilities in Azure. Which service would the admin use to store the application’s secrets?"
    choices:
    - content: "Transparent data encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Transparent data encryption helps protect Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Warehouse against the threat of malicious activity."
