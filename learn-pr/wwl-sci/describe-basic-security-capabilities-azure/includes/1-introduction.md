The traditional network security perimeter is changing as more companies move to either a hybrid cloud environment, with some resources located on-premises and some in the cloud, or a fully cloud-based network solution. Protection of your organization's assets, resources, and data is essential. Threats can come from any direction, for instance, a Denial of Service attack on your organization’s services, or a hacker trying to access your network by trying to penetrate your firewall.
