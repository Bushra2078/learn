Any company, large or small, can be the target of a serious network attack. The nature of these attacks might be to make a statement, or because the attacker wanted a challenge.

## Distributed Denial of Service attacks

The aim of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is to overwhelm the resources on your applications and servers, making them unresponsive or slow for genuine users. A DDoS attack will usually target any public-facing device that can be accessed through the internet.

The three most frequent types of DDoS attack are:

- **Volumetric attacks**: These are volume-based attacks that flood the network with seemingly legitimate traffic, overwhelming the available bandwidth. Legitimate traffic can't get through. These types of attacks are measured in bits per second.
- **Protocol attacks**: Protocol attacks render a target inaccessible by exhausting server resources with false protocol requests that exploit weaknesses in layer 3 (network) and layer 4 (transport) protocols.  These types of attacks are typically measured in packets per second.
- **Resource (application) layer attacks**: These attacks target web application packets, to disrupt the transmission of data between hosts.

## What is Azure DDoS Protection?

The Azure DDoS Protection service is designed to help protect your applications and servers by analyzing network traffic and discarding anything that looks like a DDoS attack.

In the diagram above, Azure DDoS Protection identifies an attacker's attempt to overwhelm the network. It blocks traffic from the attacker, ensuring that it doesn't reach Azure resources. Legitimate traffic from customers still flows into Azure without any interruption of service.

Azure DDoS Protection uses the scale and elasticity of Microsoft's global network to bring DDoS mitigation capacity to every Azure region. During a DDoS attack, Azure can scale your computing needs to meet demand. DDoS Protection manages cloud consumption by ensuring that your network load only reflects actual customer usage.

Azure DDoS Protection comes in two tiers:

- **Default DDoS infrastructure protection** (previously referred to as Basic): The default DDoS infrastructure protection service is automatically enabled for every property in Azure, at no extra cost, as part of the Azure platform. Always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks provide the same defenses that Microsoft’s online services use. Azure’s global network is used to distribute and mitigate attack traffic across regions.
- **DDoS Protection Standard**: The DDoS Protection Standard service (available as a SKU), combined with application design best practices, provides enhanced DDoS mitigation features to defend against DDoS attacks. It's automatically tuned to help protect your specific Azure resources in a virtual network. Protection is simple to enable on any new or existing virtual network, and it requires no application or resource changes. DDoS Protection standard has several advantages over the default infrastructure-level DDoS protection, including logging, alerting, and telemetry. See DDoS Protection Standard overview for more details.
