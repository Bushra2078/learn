So far, weâ€™ve looked at the traditional security concerns regarding the protection of your assets, resources, and data from external attack by using firewalls and network security groups. But there is another threat surface that is now being exploited by hackers: web applications.

Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities, like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Preventing such attacks in application code is challenging. It can require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring.

Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. A centralized WAF helps make security management simpler, improves the response time to a security threat, and allows patching a known vulnerability in one place, instead of securing each web application. A WAF also gives application administrators better assurance of protection against threats and intrusions.
