You understand the importance and use of encryption of data not only when stored, but also when in transit. You explored the nature of DDoS and how Azure can help protect your systems against that form of attack. Finally, you saw how Azure Bastion can help secure connections to any virtual machine in your estate.

Without these security tools, your organization would be vulnerable to data theft, would be unable to respond swiftly to malicious attacks on your web and data services, and not meet your security obligations.
