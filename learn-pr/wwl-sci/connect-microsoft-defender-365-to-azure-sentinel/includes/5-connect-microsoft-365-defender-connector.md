The Microsoft 365 Defender connector lets you stream advanced hunting logs - a type of raw event data - from Microsoft 365 Defender into Azure Sentinel.

With the integration of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint into the Microsoft 365 Defender security umbrella, you can collect your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint advanced hunting events using the Microsoft 365 Defender connector and stream them straight into new purpose-built tables in your Azure Sentinel workspace. These tables are built on the same schema that is used in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, giving you complete access to the full set of advanced hunting logs and allowing you to do the following:

- Easily copy your existing Microsoft Defender ATP advanced hunting queries into Azure Sentinel.

- Use the raw event logs to provide more insights for your alerts, hunting, and investigation, and correlate events with data from other data sources in Azure Sentinel.

- Store the logs with increased retention, beyond Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Microsoft 365 Defenderâ€™s default retention of 30 days. You can do so by configuring the retention of your workspace or by configuring per-table retention in Log Analytics.
