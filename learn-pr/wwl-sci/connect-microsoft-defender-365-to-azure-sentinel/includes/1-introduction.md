You connect Microsoft 365 Defender security solutions to the Microsoft Sentinel workspace using the provided data connectors. 
 
You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel.  As you continue your process to activate data connectors in Microsoft Sentinel, you now need to focus on the Microsoft 365 Defender solutions, including Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for Office 365.  

You realize more consideration is required because the alerts and incidents could already be investigated in the Microsoft 365 security portal.  You take time to understand how you would use the Defender data in Microsoft Sentinel.  You write a document on how alerts, incidents, and raw data will be used for event correlation in detection rules.  After documenting your decisions, you activate each Microsoft 365 Defender-related data connector.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to connect Microsoft 365 Defender security solutions to the Microsoft Sentinel workspace using the provided data connectors.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Activate the Microsoft 365 Defender connector in Microsoft Sentinel
- Activate the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint connector in Microsoft Sentinel
- Activate the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 connector in Microsoft Sentinel
