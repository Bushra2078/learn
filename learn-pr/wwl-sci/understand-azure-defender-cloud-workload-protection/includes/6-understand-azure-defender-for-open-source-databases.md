### Microsoft Defender alerts for open-source relational databases

Threat intelligence enriched security alerts are triggered when there are:

- **Anomalous database access and query patterns** For example, an abnormally high number of failed sign-in attempts with different credentials (a brute force attempt)
- **Suspicious database activities** For example, a legitimate user accessing an SQL Server from a breached computer that communicated with a crypto-mining C&C server
- **Brute-force attacks** With the ability to separate simple brute force from brute force on a valid user or a successful brute force.
