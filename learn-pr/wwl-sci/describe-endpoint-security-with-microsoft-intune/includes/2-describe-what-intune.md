Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). You control how your organizationâ€™s devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops, are used. You can also configure specific policies to control applications. For example, you can prevent emails from being sent to people outside your organization.

Intune also allows people in your organization to use their personal devices for school or work. On personal devices, Intune helps make sure your organization data stays protected, and can isolate it from personal data.

With Intune, admins can:

- Support a diverse mobile environment and manage iOS/iPadOS, Android, Windows, and macOS devices securely.
- Set rules and configure settings on personal and organization-owned devices to access data and networks.
- Deploy and authenticate apps for both on-premises and mobile devices.
- Protect your company information by controlling the way users access and share information.
- Be sure devices and apps are compliant with your security requirements.

### Mobile device management (MDM)

For devices that are owned by the business, organizations can maintain full control. This includes settings, features, and security. When these devices are enrolled with Intune, they'll receive rules and settings defined by Intune policies. For example, you can define password requirements.

When devices are enrolled and managed in Intune, administrators can:

- See the devices enrolled, and get an inventory of the ones accessing organization resources.
- Configure devices so they meet your security and health standards. For example, you probably want to block jailbroken devices.
- Push certificates to devices so users can easily access your Wi-Fi network, or use a VPN to connect to it.
- See reports on users and devices to determine if they're compliant.
- Remove organization data if a device is lost, stolen, or not used anymore.

### Mobile application management (MAM)

Users with personal devices might not want their phone to be under full corporate control. Mobile application management (MAM) gives admins the ability to protect corporate data at the application level.  Where users just want to access apps like email or Microsoft Teams, admins can use application protection policies, without requiring the device to be enrolled in Intune, supporting bring-your-own device (BYOD) scenarios.

MAM can be used with custom applications and store apps.

When apps are managed in Intune, administrators can:

- Add and assign mobile apps to user groups and devices, including users and devices in specific groups, and more.
- Configure apps to start or run with specific settings enabled and update existing apps already on the device.
- See reports on which apps are used and track their usage.
- Do a selective wipe by removing only organization data from apps.
