The following code blocks of the "Getting Started Guide For Azure Sentinel ML Notebooks" notebook provide a representative example of working with Azure Sentinel data.

**Code Block**

In this snippet of code:

- Create a new variable [test_query] that contains the KQL query.

- Next, you run the query [qry_prov.exec_query()].  This utilizes the msticpy library to execute the KQL query in the Azure Sentinel Log Analytics related workspace.  The results are stored in the [test_df] variable.

- Next, display the first five rows with the .head() function.

**Code Block**

In this snippet of code:

- You create a new function called lookup_res that takes a variable row.

- Next, you save the IP address stored in row to the variable [ip].

- The next line of code uses the msticpy function [ti.lookup_ioc()] to query the ThreatIntelligenceIndicator table for a row that is sourced from VirusTotal with a matching ip address.

- Next, the msticpy function [ti.result_to_df()] will return a DataFrame representation of response.

- The new function returns the Severity of the IP address.

**Code Block**

In this snippet of code:

- Create a new variable [vis_q] that contains the KQL query.

- Next, you run the query [qry_prov.exec_query()].  This utilizes the msticpy library to execute the KQL query in the Azure Sentinel Log Analytics related workspace.  The results are stored in the [vis_data] variable.

- Then, [qry_prov.exec_query()] returns  a pandas DataFrame that provides visualization features.  You then plot a bar graph with the unique IP addresses and how many times they were used in the first five entries of the Dataframe.
