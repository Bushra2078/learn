  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your organization has recently merged with a competitor, nearly doubling the number of employees. You urgently need to implement an access lifecycle system that won't add a significant amount of work for your IT administrators. Which Azure AD feature should you implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dynamic groups."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dynamic groups use attribute-based rules to determine who is a member of a group, thereby reducing the administrative overhead of adding and removing users."
    - content: "Conditional access policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conditional access policies are used to enforce organizational rules for access, but do not implement access lifecycle requirements."
    - content: "Azure AD Terms of Use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AD Terms of Use presents information to users before they access data. Azure AD Terms of Use does not implement access lifecycle requirements."
  - content: "Your organization is project-oriented with employees often working on more than one project at a time. Which solution is best suited to managing user access to your organizationâ€™s resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Terms of Use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AD Terms of Use presents information to users before they access data but does not manage access rights."
    - content: "Dynamic groups."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Dynamic groups use attribute-based rules to determine who is a member of a group, which is well suited to role-based organizations."
    - content: "Entitlement management."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Entitlement management is well suited to handling project-based access needs. Entitlement management automates access requests, access assignments, reviews, and expiration for bundles of resources relevant to a project."
  - content: "Your organization has recently conducted a security audit and found that four people who have left the organization were still active and assigned Global Admin roles. The users have now been deleted and you've been asked to recommend a solution to prevent a similar security lapse happening in future. Which solution should you recommend?"
    choices:
    - content: "Entitlement Management."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Entitlement management automates access request workflows, access assignments, reviews, and expiration but does not prevent users who have left the organization retaining access rights."
    - content: "Privileged Identity Management."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Privileged Identity Management mitigates the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions."
    - content: "Identity protection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Identity protection allows you to detect identity-based risk but does not mitigate the risk of inappropriate privileges being assigned to users who have left the organization."
  - content: "You've recently discovered that several user accounts in the Finance Department have been compromised. Your CTO has asked for your help in finding a solution to reduce the impact of compromised user accounts. They've asked you to look at three Azure AD features, which one should you recommend?"
    choices:
    - content: "Identity protection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Identity protection is a tool that allows organizations to utilize security signals to identify potential threats."
    - content: "Conditional access."
