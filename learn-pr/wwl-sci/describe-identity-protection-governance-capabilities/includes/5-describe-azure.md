Identity Protection is a tool that allows organizations to accomplish three key tasks:

- Automate the detection and remediation of identity-based risks.
- Investigate risks using data in the portal.
- Export risk detection data to third-party utilities for further analysis.

Microsoft analyses 6.5 trillion signals per day to identify potential threats. These signals come from learnings Microsoft has acquired from their position in organizations with Azure AD, the consumer space with Microsoft Accounts, and in gaming with Xbox.

The signals generated by these services are fed to Identity Protection, so they can then be used by tools such as Conditional Access, which uses Identity Protection signals to make access decisions. They are also fed to a security information and event management (SIEM) tools, such as Sentinel, for further investigation.

Identity Protection categorizes risk into three tiers: low, medium, and high.  Additionally, it can calculate the sign-in risk, and user identity risk.  

Sign-in risk is the probability that the sign-in wasnâ€™t performed by the user, and uses the following signals to calculate the risk:

- Atypical travel. Sign in from an atypical location based on the user's recent sign-ins.
- Anonymous IP address. Sign in from an anonymous IP address (for example: Tor browser, anonymized VPNs).

User risk is a probability that the user identity has been compromised, and uses the following signals to calculate the risk:

- Unfamiliar sign-in properties. Sign in with properties we've not seen recently for the given user.
- Malware linked IP address. Sign in from a malware linked IP address.
- Leaked Credentials. Indicates that the user's valid credentials have been leaked.
- Password spray. Indicates that multiple usernames are being attacked using common passwords in a unified, brute-force manner.
- Azure AD threat intelligence. Microsoft's internal and external threat intelligence sources have identified a known attack pattern.

These risk signals can trigger actions such as requiring users to provide multi-factor authentication, reset their password, or block access until an administrator takes action.

Identity Protection provides organizations with three reports that they can use to investigate identity risks in their environment. These reports are the **risky users**, **risky sign-ins**, and **risk detections**. Investigation of events is key to understanding and identifying any weak points in your security strategy.

After completing an investigation, admins will want to take action to remediate the risk or unblock users. Organizations also have the option to enable automated remediation using their risk policies. Microsoft recommends closing events as soon as possible because time matters when working with risk.

Identity protection is a feature of Azure AD Premium.
