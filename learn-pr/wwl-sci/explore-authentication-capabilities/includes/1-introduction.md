In this module, you'll learn about the authentication capabilities of Azure AD. Authentication is the process of verifying an identity to be legitimate. Passwords are commonly used to authenticate users, but they have many problems. Passwords are difficult for users to remember, and easy for hackers to guess.

Because good passwords are necessarily difficult to remember, users often keep the same one for many different applications, providing multiple points of entry for a compromised identity.

In this module, you'll learn about multifactor authentication, and how it improves security. You'll also find out about the password protection and management capabilities of Azure AD.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the authentication methods of Azure AD.
- Describe the password protection and management capabilities of Azure AD.
