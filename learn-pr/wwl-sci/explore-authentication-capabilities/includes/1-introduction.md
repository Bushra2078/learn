In this module, you will learn about the authentication capabilities of Azure AD. Authentication is the process of verifying an identity to be legitimate. Passwords are commonly used to authenticate users, but they have many problems. Passwords are difficult for users to remember, and easy for hackers to guess. Because good passwords are necessarily difficult to remember, users often use the same password for multiple applications, providing multiple points of entry for a compromised identity.

In this module you will learn about multi-factor authentication, and how it improves security. You will also learn about the password protection and management capabilities of Azure AD.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Describe the authentication methods of Azure AD.
- Describe the password protection and management capabilities of Azure AD.
