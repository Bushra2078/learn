  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "After hearing of a breach at a competitor, the security team wants to improve identity security within their organization. What should they implement immediately to provide the greatest protection to user identities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Multifactor authentication."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Multifactor authentication dramatically improves the security of an identity."
    - content: "Require biometrics for all sign-ins."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While biometric sign-in is secure, there may be a hardware cost that makes it difficult to implement quickly."
    - content: "Require strong passwords for all identities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's  incorrect. Although strong passwords improve security, they're not as secure as multiple layers of security."
  - content: "To improve identity security within the organization, the security team wants to implement Windows Hello for Business. When explaining the benefits of Windows Hello for Business, which of the following statements is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "Windows Hello is an authentication feature built into Windows Server 2012 R26."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Windows Hello is an authentication feature built into Windows 10."
    - content: "Windows Hello is an alternative to multifactor authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Windows Hello uses multifactor authentication, such as a PIN and biometric data, to authenticate users."
    - content: "Windows Hello for Business is more secure because it uses PINs and biometric data to authenticate users."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Windows Hello for Business uses a PIN and biometric data to authenticate users and doesn't transmit data to an external server."
  - content: "A company's IT organization has been asked to find ways to reduce IT costs, without compromising security. Which feature should they consider implementing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Self-service password reset."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Self-service password reset allows users to change or reset their own passwords, thereby reducing the cost of providing administrators and help desk personnel."
    - content: "Biometric sign-in on all devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Biometric sign-in is secure but may involve upgrading hardware."
    - content: "FIDO2."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. FIDO2 may require the purchase of external keys such as a USB device, which might involve additional expense."
