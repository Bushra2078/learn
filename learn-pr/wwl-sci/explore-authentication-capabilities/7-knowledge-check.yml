  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "After hearing of a security breach at a competitor, you want to improve identity security within your organization. What should you implement immediately to provide the greatest protection to user identities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Multi-factor authentication."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct. Multi-factor authentication dramatically improves the security of an identity."
    - content: "Require biometrics for all sign-in."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. Whilst biometric sign-in is secure, there may be a hardware cost and so difficult to implement quickly."
    - content: "Require strong passwords for all identities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. Although strong passwords improve security, passwords alone are not as secure as multiple layers of security."
  - content: "To improve identity security within your organization, you want to implement Windows Hello for Business. When explaining the benefits of Windows Hello for Business to your colleagues, which of the following is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "Windows Hello is an authentication feature built into Windows Server 2012 R26."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. Windows Hello is an authentication feature built into Windows 10."
    - content: "Windows Hello is an alternative to multi-factor authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. Windows Hello uses multi-factor authentication to authenticate users, such as a PIN and biometric data."
    - content: "Windows Hello for Business is more secure because it uses PINs and biometric data to authenticate users."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct. Windows Hello for Business uses a PIN and biometric data to authenticate users and does not transmit data to an external server."
  - content: "You've been asked to find ways to reduce IT costs, without compromising security. Which feature should you consider implementing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Self-service password reset."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct. Self-service password reset allows users to change or reset their own passwords, thereby reducing the cost of providing administrators and help desk personnel."
    - content: "Biometric sign-in on all devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. Biometric sign-in is secure but may involve up-grading hardware."
    - content: "FIDO2."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. FIDO2 may require the purchase of external keys such as a USB device, which may involve additional expense."
  - content: "As a result of a recent security review, you've been asked to recommend the best way to ensure users set strong passwords. Which Azure AD feature should you implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Windows Hello."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. Windows Hello is a passwordless authentication feature."
    - content: "Password Protection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct. Password Protection is a feature of Azure AD which reduces the risk of users setting weak passwords."
    - content: "User training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. Although user training will improve usersâ€™ awareness of the dangers of setting weak passwords, it is not the most efficient way to ensure users set strong passwords. It is also not a feature of Azure AD."
