In this module you learned how to specify security baseline for clients'
endpoints based on the different options that are available. You learned
that the selection of the appropriate security baseline starts with the
understanding of which operating system the security baseline needs to
be applied to. You learned how to define the security requirements for
servers and the importance of understanding the server's role as the
server's role will dictate the hardening settings that should be
applied.

You learned how to specify security requirements for mobile devices and
clients. The considerations regarding application isolation and
operating system hardening. In addition, you learned more how to specify
requirements for securing Active Directory Domain Services, and how to
design a strategy to manage secrets, keys, and certificates.

In addition, you learned the options available for remote access and the
