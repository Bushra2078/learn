Your organization's data is likely one of the most important assets you're responsible for safeguarding as an administrator. The ability to build apps and automation to use that data is a large part of your company's success. You can use Power Apps and Power Automate for rapid build and rollout of these high-value apps so that users can measure and act on the data in real time.
