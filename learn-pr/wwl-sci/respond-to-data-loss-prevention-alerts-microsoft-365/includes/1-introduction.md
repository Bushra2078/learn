Microsoft 365 provides data loss prevention (DLP) protection to identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information.

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Purview Compliance solutions.  Based on recent security incidents in your organization, you've been assigned the responsibility to advise the compliance team on the types of information they should protect.  

To work with the compliance team, you need to learn about the data loss prevention components. These include sensitive info types, sensitivity labels, DLP policies, and policy alerts.
