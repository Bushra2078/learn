Microsoft 365 provides data loss prevention (DLP) protection to identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft 365 compliance solutions.  Based on recent security incidents in your organization, you have been assigned the responsibility to advise the compliance team on the types of information they should protect.  

To work with the compliance team, you need to learn about the data loss prevention components, including sensitive info types, sensitivity labels, DLP policies, and policy alerts.
