Azure Policy is designed to help enforce standards and assess compliance across your organization. Through its compliance dashboard, you can access an aggregated view to help evaluate the overall state of the environment. You can drill down to a per-resource, or per-policy level granularity. You can also use capabilities like bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources, to resolve issues rapidly and effectively. Common use cases for Azure Policy include implementing governance for resource consistency, regulatory compliance, security, cost, and management.

Azure Policy evaluates all resources in Azure and Arc enabled resources (specific resource types hosted outside of Azure).

Azure Policy evaluates whether the properties of resources match with business rules. These business rules are described using [JSON](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure) format, and referred to as [policy definitions](/azure/governance/policy/overview#policy-definition). For simplified management, you can group together multiple business rules to form a single [policy initiative](/azure/governance/policy/overview#initiative-definition). After business rules have been formed, you can assign the policy definition, or policy initiative, to any scope of resources that are supported, such as management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, or individual resources.  

## Evaluation outcomes

Azure Policy evaluates resources at specific times during the resource lifecycle and the policy assignment lifecycle, and for regular ongoing compliance evaluation. The following events or times will trigger an evaluation:

- A resource has been created, deleted, or updated in scope with a policy assignment.
- A policy or an initiative is newly assigned to a scope.
- A policy or an initiative that's been assigned to a scope is updated.
- The standard compliance evaluation cycle (happens once every 24 hours).

Organizations will vary in how they respond to non-compliant resources. Here's some examples:

- Deny a change to a resource.
- Log changes to a resource.
- Alter a resource before or after a change.
- Deploy related compliant resources.  

With Azure Policy, responses like these are made possible by using [effects](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effects), which are specified in policy definitions.

## What’s the difference between Azure Policy and Azure role-based access control (RBAC)?

It’s important not to confuse Azure Policy and Azure RBAC. You use Azure Policy to ensure that the resource state is compliant to your organization’s business rules, no matter who made the change or who has permission to make changes. Azure Policy will evaluate the state of a resource, and act to ensure the resource stays compliant.

Azure RBAC focuses instead on managing user actions at different scopes. Azure RBAC manages who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they can access.  If actions need to be controlled, then you would use Azure RBAC.  If an individual has access to complete an action, but the result is a non-compliant resource, Azure Policy still blocks the action.

Azure RBAC and Azure Policy should be used together to achieve full scope control in Azure.
