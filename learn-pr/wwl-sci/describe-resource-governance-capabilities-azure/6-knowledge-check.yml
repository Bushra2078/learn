  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "The compliance admin for the organization wants to ensure that users can access the resources they need, but not accidentally delete resources. Which Azure resource lock level can the admin set to ensure that users can read and modify a resource, but can't delete the resource?"
    choices:
    - content: "ReadOnly"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Users can't modify the resource with this lock level. Instead, use CanNotDelete.​​​"
    - content: "CanNotDelete"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This lock will ensure users can still read and modify the resource, without being able to delete it.​​​"
    - content: "UpdateAndDelete"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option isn't valid for Azure resource locks. Instead, use CanNotDelete.​​​"
  - content: "Which tool can enable an organization's development team to rapidly provision and run new resources, in a repeatable way that is in line with the organization’s compliance requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can't use Azure Policy to provision resources. Instead, use Azure Blueprints.​​​"
    - content: "Azure Rapid Build"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "​​​Not a valid tool in Azure. Instead, use Azure Blueprints."
    - content: "Azure Blueprints"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "​​​Azure Blueprint will enable your development teams to define a repeatable set of Azure resources, and achieve shorter development times and faster delivery."
  - content: "Within an organization, there are many users who will need to access Azure and perform different actions across various scopes. The admin wants to implement action management at all scopes across Azure for the organization. What can the admin use to address this need?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure RBAC focuses on user action management at different scopes. If actions need to be controlled, then you would use Azure RBAC.​​​"
    - content: "Use Azure Policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Policy doesn't enforce user action management at different scopes. If actions need to be controlled, then you should use Azure RBAC.​​​"
    - content: "Use Azure action management (AM)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option doesn't exist. Instead, use Azure RBAC because it focuses on user action management at different scopes. If actions need to be controlled, then you should use Azure RBAC.​​​"
