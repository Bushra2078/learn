Knowledge base (KB) connections, a feature of Microsoft Copilot for Security currently in preview, allows you to integrate your organizationâ€™s knowledge base as an additional source of information. The inclusion of knowledge bases gives Copilot more context, resulting in responses that are more relevant, specific, and customized to your organization.

There are two ways to integrate KBs into Copilot:

- Azure AI Search plugin (BYO index)
- File upload

### Azure AI Search plugin (BYO index)

Azure AI Search provides secure information retrieval, at scale, over user-owned content in traditional and conversational search applications.

In Azure AI Search, a search index is your searchable content, available to the search engine for indexing, full text search, vector search, hybrid search, and filtered queries.

In Azure AI Search, a search index is your searchable content, available to the search engine for indexing and search using different methods. This is analogous to the index in a book. The index is created by going scanning through the contents of the book, identifying key topics, terms, and important dates, and other information, and then listing them in the back of the book with page numbers. The index enables you to search by topic, date, terms, and more. In Azure AI Search, "indexing" is similar. The system scans through all your content, identifies important pieces of information (like keywords, phrases, and data points), and organizes them in a structured way so the search engine can quickly find and retrieve this information when needed.  The indexing enables full text search, vector search, hybrid search, and filtered queries.

The Azure AI Search plugin allows you to bring your own index (BYO index)
