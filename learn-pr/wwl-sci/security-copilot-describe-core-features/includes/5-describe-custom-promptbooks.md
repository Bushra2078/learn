Promptbooks in Copilot for Security are collections of prompts that have been put together to accomplish specific security-related tasks. They run one prompt after another, building on previous responses.

You can create your own promptbook with the promptbook builder to automate investigation flows and optimize repetitive steps in Copilot that are customized to your needs and requirements. You can also share the promptbooks youâ€™ve created to other users so they can also benefit from your work.

### Create a promptbook from an existing session

To create your own promptbook, you can start with an existing session that contains the prompts you want to work with.

Select the boxes beside the prompts to include them or select the top box to include all prompts in the session. Selecting any or all of the prompts light up the Create promptbook button.
