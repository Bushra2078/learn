The unified Action center of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal lists pending and completed remediation actions for your devices, email & collaboration content, and identities in one location.

The unified Action center brings together remediation actions across Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Office 365. It defines a common language for all remediation actions and provides a unified investigation experience. Your security operations team has a "single pane of glass" experience to view and manage remediation actions.

The Action Center consists of pending and historical items:

- **Pending** displays a list of ongoing investigations that require attention. Recommended actions are presented that your security operations team can approve or reject. The Pending tab appears only if there are pending actions to be approved (or rejected).

- **History** as an audit log for all of the following items:

  - Remediation actions that were taken as a result of an automated investigation

  - Remediation actions that were approved by your security operations team (some actions, such as sending a file to quarantine, can be undone)

  - Commands that were run and remediation actions that were applied in Live Response sessions (some actions can be undone)

  - Remediation actions that were applied by Microsoft Defender Antivirus (some actions can be undone)

Select Automated Investigations, then Action center.

When an automated investigation runs, a verdict is generated for each piece of evidence investigated. Verdicts can be Malicious, Suspicious, or No threats found depending on:

- Type of threat

- Resulting verdict

- How your organization's device groups are configured

Remediation actions can occur automatically or only upon approval by your organization’s security operations team.

### Review pending actions
