Microsoft 365 Defender provides a purpose-driven user interface to manage and investigate security incidents and alerts across Microsoft 365 services.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft 365 Defender solutions, including Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Identity, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.  

You need to see related alerts across all the solutions as one incident to see the incident's full impact and do a root cause investigation.  The Microsoft 365 Defender portal is a unified view of incidents and actions taken.
