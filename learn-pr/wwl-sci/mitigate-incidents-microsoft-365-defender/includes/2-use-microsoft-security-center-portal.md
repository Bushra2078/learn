The Microsoft 365 Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com/](https://security.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true)) is a specialized workspace designed to meet the needs of security teams. These solutions are integrated across Microsoft 365 services and provide actionable insights to help reduce risks and safeguard your digital estate.

You can investigate the alerts that affect your network, understand what they mean, and collate evidence associated with the incidents so that you can devise an effective remediation plan.

The Home page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data is dependent on the user's role. Because the Microsoft 365 Defender portal uses role-based access control, different roles will see cards that are more meaningful to their day-to-day jobs.

This at-a-glance information helps you keep up with the latest activities in your organization. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal brings together signals from different sources to present a holistic view of your Microsoft 365 environment.

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal combines protection, detection, investigation, and response to email, collaboration, identity, device, and app threats, in a central place.

This single pane of glass brings together functionality from existing Microsoft security portals, like the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and the Office 365 Security & Compliance center.
