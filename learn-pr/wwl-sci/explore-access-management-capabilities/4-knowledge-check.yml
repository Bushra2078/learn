  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You've been asked to consider the feasibility of implementing conditional access for your organization. What must you do to implement conditional access?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create policies that enforce organizational rules."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Conditional access is implemented using policies that enforce organizational rules."
    - content: "Check that all users have multi-factor authentication enabled."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Conditional access policies may require a user to sign in with multi-factor authentication, but it is not part of implementing conditional access."
    - content: "Amend your apps to allow conditional access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Conditional access does not require any apps to be changed in any way."
  - content: "Sign in risk is a signal used by conditional access policies to decide whether to grant or deny access. What is sign in risk?"
    choices:
    - content: "The probability that the device is owned by the identity owner."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Sign in risk does not calculate any probability relating to users’ devices."
    - content: "The probability that the authentication request is authorized by the identity owner."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Sign in risk is the real-time calculation that a given authentication require was made by the specific user’s identity."
    - content: "The probability that the user is authorized to view data from a particular application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Sign in risk does not calculate the probability that a user is authorized to view data."
  - content: "You've been asked to review Azure AD roles assigned to users to improve organizational security. Which of the following should you implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Remove all Global Admin roles assigned to users."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You should have the least number of Global Admin roles required for your organization, and a minimum of two."
    - content: "Create custom roles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Custom roles give flexibility when granting access but are not necessarily more secure than built-in roles."
    - content: "Replace Global Admin roles with specific Azure AD roles."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. By following the least privilege security model and assigning specific admin roles such as billing administrator, or user administrator to more users, instead of global admin roles, you can improve organizational security."
