In this module, you've learned about Conditional Access and how it's used to protect resources. You've seen how Conditional Access policies use *if then* statements with signals to determine whether to grant access, require more information, or block access.

You also learned about built-in admin roles, and custom roles in Azure AD. And you found out about the concept of least privilege access, and how this protects resources.

Now you've completed this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe Conditional Access and its benefits.
