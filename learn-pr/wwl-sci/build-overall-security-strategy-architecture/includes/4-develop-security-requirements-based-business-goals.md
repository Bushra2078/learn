The most successful transformation journeys start with business goals. Cloud adoption can be a costly and time-consuming effort. Fostering the right level of support from IT and other areas of the business is crucial to success. Microsoft has created a [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) to help customers identify business outcomes that are concise, defined, and drive observable results or change in business performance, supported by a specific measures.

For an overview of the Cloud Adoption Framework, view the following video:

## Cloud Adoption Framework overview

The Cloud Adoption Framework brings together cloud adoption best practices from Microsoft employees, partners, and customers. It consists of tools, documentation, and proven practices. The tools it includes help you shape your technology, business, and people strategies to achieve the best business outcomes possible through your cloud adoption effort.

The Cloud Adoption Framework consists of nine different methodologies:

* Strategy: Define business justification and expected adoption outcomes.
* Plan: Align actionable adoption plans to business outcomes.
* Ready: Prepare your cloud environment for planned changes.
* Migrate: Migrate and modernize existing workloads.
* Innovate: Develop new cloud-native or hybrid solutions.
* Secure: Improve security over time.
* Manage: Manage operations for cloud and hybrid solutions.
* Govern: Govern your environment and workloads.
* Organize: Align the teams and roles supporting your organization's cloud adoption efforts.

Each methodology listed above is part of a broad cloud adoption lifecycle. The methodologies of the Cloud Adoption Framework integrate into a life cycle that consists of four main phases which proceed in sequence and then three other phases which occur continuously throughout the cloud adoption process. The following image outline the cloud adoption lifecycle.

## Define your strategy

Here, you answer why you're moving to the cloud and what you want to get out of cloud migration. Do you need to scale to meet demand or reach new markets? Will it reduce costs or increase business agility? When defining your cloud business strategy, you should understand [cloud economics](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/cloud-economics) and consider the business impact, turnaround time, global reach, performance, and more. Here are the steps to define your cloud strategy:

1. **Define and document motivations**: Meeting with stakeholders and leadership can help you answer why you're moving to the cloud.
1. **Document business outcomes**: Meet with leadership from finance, marketing, sales, and human resource groups to help you document your goals.
1. **Evaluate financial considerations**: Measure objectives and identify the return expected from a specific investment.
1. **Understand technical considerations**: Evaluate technical considerations through the selection and completion of your first technical project.

## Make a plan

Here, you build a plan that maps your aspirational goals to specific actions. A good plan helps ensure that your efforts map to the desired business outcomes. Here are steps to build a solid plan:

1. **Digital estate**: Create an inventory of the existing digital assets and workloads that you plan to migrate to the cloud.
1. **Initial organizational alignment**: Ensure the right people are involved in migration efforts, both from a technical standpoint as well as from a cloud governance standpoint.
1. **Skills readiness plan**: Build a plan that helps individuals build the skills they need to operate in the cloud.
1. **Cloud adoption plan**: Build a comprehensive plan that brings together the development, operations, and business teams toward a shared cloud adoption goal.

## Ready your organization

Here, you create a *landing zone* or an environment in the cloud to begin hosting your workloads. Here are steps to ready your organization:

1. **Azure setup guide**: Review the Azure setup guide to become familiar with the tools and approaches you need to use to create a landing zone.
1. **Azure landing zone**: Begin to build out the Azure subscriptions that support each of the major areas of your business. A landing zone includes cloud infrastructure as well as governance, accounting, and security capabilities.
1. **Expand the landing zone**: Refine your landing zone to ensure that it meets your operations, governance, and security needs.
1. **Best practices**: Start with recommended and proven practices to help ensure that your cloud migration efforts are scalable and maintainable.

## Secure

As a Cybersecurity Architect, the **Secure** methodology of the Cloud Adoption Framework will be of particular interest. The Secure methodology provides a vision of the complete end state to guide the improvement of your security program over time. The following infographic provides a visual mapping of the key ways that security integrates with the larger organization and the disciplines within security.

:::image type="content" source="../media/secure-methodology-popout.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the secure methodology of the cloud adoption framework." lightbox="../media/secure-methodology-popout.png":::

The Secure methodology consists of three ways to integrate security into the larger organization, as well as five security disciplines which should be a part of your security program.

**Integration approaches:**

- Risk insights - The goal of the security team is to learn about a business, and then use their security expertise to identify risks to business goals and assets. Security then advises decision makers on each risk and then recommends which ones are acceptable. This information is provided with the understanding that the responsibility for these decisions lies with your asset or process owner.
- Security integration - security should be a part of everyone's job, just like business requirements, performance, and reliability. Security, at all levels, should be familiar with overall business priorities, IT initiatives, and risk appetite for your organization. Envision security as a thread that weaves through every aspect of your business. Security should feel like natural part of business. Business should feel like a natural part of security.
- Business resilience - An organization can never have perfect security, but it can become resilient to security attacks. Like we are never perfectly immune to all health and safety risks in the physical world, the data and information systems we operate are also never 100 percent safe from all attacks all the time. Focus your security efforts on increasing the resilience of business operations in the face of security incidents. These efforts can reduce risk and enable continuous improvements in security posture and your ability to respond to incidents.

**Security disciplines:**

- Access Control - Access control is the part of security that people experience first and most often. They see it when they sign in to their computers and mobile phones, when they share a file or try to access an application, and when they use an ID card key to enter a building or room. While access control isn't everything in security, it's critically important, and it requires proper attention so that both the user experience and the security assurances are right.
- Security operations - Security operations reduce risk by limiting damage from attackers who gain access to your organization's resources. Security operations focus on reducing the time attackers have access to resources by detecting, responding to, and helping recover from active attacks. Rapid response and recovery protect your organization by damaging the adversary's return on investment (ROI). When adversaries are evicted and forced to start a new attack, their cost to attack your organization goes up.
- Asset protection - Assets include physical and virtual items such as laptops, databases, files, and virtual storage accounts. Securing business critical assets often relies on the security of underlying systems, like storage, data, endpoint devices, and application components. The most valuable technical assets are typically data and the availability of applications, such as business websites, production lines, and communications.
- Security governance - Security governance bridges your business priorities with technical implementation like architecture, standards, and policy. Governance teams provide oversight and monitoring to sustain and improve security posture over time. These teams also report compliance as required by regulating bodies.
- Innovation security - Innovation is the lifeblood of an organization in the digital age and needs to be both enabled and protected. Innovation security protects the processes and data of innovation against cyberattacks. Innovation in the digital age takes the form of developing applications using the DevOps or DevSecOps method to rapidly innovate without waiting for the traditional waterfall ship schedule that can take months or years between releases.
