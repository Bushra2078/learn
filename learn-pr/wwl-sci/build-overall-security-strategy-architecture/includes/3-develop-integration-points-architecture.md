The [Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA)](/security/cybersecurity-reference-architecture/mcra) describe Microsoft's cybersecurity capabilities. The reference architectures describe how Microsoft security capabilities integrate with Microsoft services and applications, Microsoft cloud platforms such as Azure and Microsoft 365, third party apps such as ServiceNow and Salesforce, and third party platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

The reference architectures are primarily composed of detailed technical diagrams on Microsoft cybersecurity capabilities, Zero Trust user access, security operations, operational technology (OT), multi-cloud and cross-platform capabilities, attack chain coverage, Azure native security controls, and security organizational functions.

The MCRA also includes an overview of Zero Trust and a Zero Trust rapid modernization plan (RaMP). Additionally, this includes other key information on security operations and key initiatives like protecting from human operated ransomware, securing privileged access, moving beyond VPN, and more.

## Using the MCRA

MCRA is used for several purposes, including: 

- Starting template for a security architecture: The most common use case is to help organizations define a target state for cybersecurity capabilities. Organizations find this architecture useful because it covers capabilities across the modern enterprise estate that now spans on-premise, mobile devices, multiple clouds, and IoT / Operational Technology. 
- Comparison reference of security capabilities: Some organizations use MCRA to compare Microsoft's architecture recommendations with what they already own and have implemented. Many organizations find that they weren't aware that they already own quite a bit of security architecture technology. 
- Learn about Microsoft's integration investments: MCRA helps architects and technical teams identify how to take advantage of integration points within Microsoft capabilities and existing security capabilities. 
- Learn about cybersecurity: Some architects, particularly those new to cybersecurity, use this as a learning tool to prepare for their first career or a career change. 

The table below shows the full organizational security landscape, demonstrating how key Microsoft technologies fit into that landscape. It lists each major security domain, the Microsoft products within it, a summary of the capability that product fulfills and some additional details.
