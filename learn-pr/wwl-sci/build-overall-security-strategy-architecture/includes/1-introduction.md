## What is a Cybersecurity Architect?

Cybersecurity Architects are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the security functions of an organization's IT environment. Security architects help translate an organization's business and assurance goals into a security vision, providing documentation and diagrams to guide technical security decisions. They are responsible for ensuring that the information security requirements necessary to protect the organization's core missions and business processes are adequately addressed in all aspects of enterprise architecture, including reference models, segment and solution architectures, and the resulting information systems supporting those missions and business processes.
