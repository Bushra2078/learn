Today, organizations need a new security model that effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern environment, embraces the mobile workforce, and protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located.

This is the core of **Zero Trust**. Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach, and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model teaches us to \"never trust,always verify.\"

#### Guiding principles of Zero Trust

| Verify explicitly | Use least privilege access  | Assume breach |
|:---------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Protect assets against attacker control by explicitly validating that all trust and security decisions use all relevant available information and telemetry. | Limit access of a potentially compromised asset with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA) and risk-based polices like adaptive access control. | Assume attackers can and will successfully attack anything in the system (identity, network, device, app, infrastructure, etc.) and plan accordingly. |

A Zero Trust approach should extend throughout the entire digital estate and serve as an integrated security philosophy and end-to-end strategy. This is done by implementing Zero Trust controls and technologies across six foundational elements. Each of these is a source of signal, a control plane for enforcement, and a critical resource to be defended.

Different organizational requirements, existing technology
implementations, and security stages all affect how a Zero Trust
security model implementation is planned. Using our experience in helping customers to secure their organizations, as well as in implementing our own Zero Trust model, we\'ve developed the following guidance to assess your readiness and to help you build a plan to get to Zero Trust.
