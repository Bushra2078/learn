Security resiliency is focused on supporting the resiliency of your business, and has two main goals:

- **Enable your business** to rapidly innovate and adapt to the ever changing business environment. Security should always be seeking safe ways to say yes to business innovation and technology adoption. Your organization can then adapt to unexpected changes in the business environment, like the sudden shift to working from home during COVID-19.
- **Limit the impact** and likelihood of disruptions before, during, and after active attacks to business operations.

Security resilience is achieved through managing risk across a full lifecycle, as shown in the diagram below.

- **Before an incident:** Continuously improve security posture and the organization's ability to respond to an incident. Continuously improving security posture helps limit the likelihood and potential impact of a security incident on your business operations and assets. There are many techniques covered throughout the security disciplines, but all of them are designed to raise the cost of attack. Make the attackers develop and try new techniques because you've made their old ones stop working. These techniques raise their costs and friction, slowing them down and limiting their success.

- **During an incident:** Business operations must continue during an incident, even if they're degraded, slower, or limited to only critical systems. During an attack, a hospital can't stop caring for patients, ships need to move cargo, and planes must continue to fly safely. The two main priorities during an incident are:

    - **Protect critical operations:** If threatened, all efforts should focus on protecting and sustaining critical business operations over all other functions.
    - **Prevent further damage:** The default priority for security operations is to discover the full extent of attacker access, and then rapidly evict them from the environment. This eviction prevents further damage by the attackers, including retaliation.

- **After an incident:** If business operations are damaged during an attack, repairs must start immediately to restore full business operations. These repairs apply even if that means restoring operations without data that was lost in an attack, for example ransomware or a destructive attack like *NotPetya*.

- **Feedback loop:** Attackers repeat themselves, or repeat what other attackers have found to work. Attackers learn from attacking your organization, so you must continuously learn from their attacks. Focus on taking the proven and available techniques that were attempted before. Then ensure you can block, detect, rapidly respond, and recover from them. Your efforts raise the cost of attack on your organization and deter or slow down future attacks.
