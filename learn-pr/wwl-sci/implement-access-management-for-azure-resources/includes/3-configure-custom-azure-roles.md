If the Azure built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own Azure custom roles. Just like built-in roles, you can assign custom roles to users, groups, and service principals at management group (in preview only), subscription and resource group scopes. Custom roles are stored in an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directory and can be shared across subscriptions. Each directory can have up to 5000 custom roles. Custom roles can be created using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the REST API.

### Create the custom role from the user interface

You would assign a custom role to a user, group, or other resource the same as you do for built-in.  Your admin, just gets to control exactly with capabilities the custom role has access to.  The principle of least privilege let's you pick just the capabilities you need.  To create the custom role:
1. Open Azure AD in the Azure portal.
2. Select **Roles and administration**.
3. Select **+ New custom role**.
4. Then name and assign the capabilities needed.

### Create a custom role from a JSON template
You can use a JSON file to create a custom role.  Here is a sample:

```
{
    "properties": {
        "roleName": "Billing Reader Plus",
        "description": "Read billing data and download invoices",
        "assignableScopes": [
            "/subscriptions/your-subscription-number"
        ],
        "permissions": [
            {
                "actions": [
                    "Microsoft.Authorization/*/read",
                    "Microsoft.Billing/*/read",
                    "Microsoft.Commerce/*/read",
                    "Microsoft.Consumption/*/read",
                    "Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/read",
                    "Microsoft.CostManagement/*/read",
                    "Microsoft.Support/*"
                ],
                "notActions": [],
                "dataActions": [],
                "notDataActions": []
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The asterick (*) is used as a wildcard. If you need to assign all of the **read** permissions from the **Billing** resource, that use this command **Microsoft/Billing/*/read**.  The wildcard can exist at any level.
