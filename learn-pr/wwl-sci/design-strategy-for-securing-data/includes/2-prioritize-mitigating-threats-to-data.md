Cybersecurity weaknesses identified in your organization are mapped to
actionable security recommendations and prioritized by their impact.
Prioritized recommendations help shorten the time to mitigate or
remediate vulnerabilities and drive compliance.

Most attacks follow a common process referred to within the security
industry as the "Kill Chain." An attack follows a basic pattern and
proceeds from one step to the next to achieve the wanted outcomes. This
step-wise process can be defended against by implementing security
measures on choke points in the chain. Since any step can be bypassed
through various exploitation techniques, the best strategies apply
defenses at every step along the chain.

### How much control do companies have?

![Diagram that shows the degree of control that companies have over their infrastructure.](../media/how-much-control.png) 

In an on-premises environment, you have firewalls, email gateways, and
proxies that can conduct a content inspection. That protection boundary
has now expanded to include mobile devices, tablets, and cloud assets.
Often the devices that have access to a company's data are either
lightly managed or not managed at all. Some companies may use Mobile
Device Management (MDM) solutions to help enforce some level of
security, such as encrypting the device or configuring it for remote
wipe in the event the device gets stolen. However, they still don't have
any control when data on those devices moves outside their controlled
environment.

In today's cloud-centric world, organizations are faced with the
unregulated (such as files on cloud storage services) and the unknown
(such as advanced threats targeting users' email). This situation is
more difficult to protect because data is now stored everywhere - it's
on-premises, on PCs, on phones, and in the cloud.

### Ransomware Protection

Mitigating ransomware and extortion attacks is an urgent priority for
organizations because of the high impact of these attacks and high
likelihood an organization will experience one.

Ransomware is a type of extortion attack that encrypts files and
folders, preventing access to important data. Criminals use ransomware
to extort money from victims by demanding money, usually in form of
cryptocurrency, in exchange for a decryption key. Criminals also often
use ransomware to extort money from victims in exchange for not
releasing sensitive data to the dark web or the public internet.

These attacks can be catastrophic to business operations and are
difficult to clean up, requiring complete adversary eviction to protect
against future attacks. Unlike early forms of ransomware that only
required malware remediation, human-operated ransomware can continue to
threaten your business operations after the initial encounter.


### Prevent and Recover from Ransomware

#### Phase 1. Prepare your recovery plan

This phase is designed to [minimize the monetary incentive from
ransomware
attackers](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/compass/protect-against-ransomware-phase1) by
making it:

-   Much harder to access and disrupt systems or encrypt or damage key
    organization data.

-   Easier for your organization to recover from an attack without
    paying the ransom.

#### Phase 2. Limit the scope of damage

Make the attackers work a lot harder to [gain access to multiple
business critical systems through privileged access
roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/compass/protect-against-ransomware-phase2).
Limiting the attacker's ability to get privileged access makes it much
harder to profit off of an attack on your organization, making it more
likely they will give up and go elsewhere.

#### Phase 3. Make it harder to get in

This last set of tasks is important to raise friction for entry but will
take time to complete as part of a larger security journey. The goal of
this phase is for attackers to have to work a lot harder to [obtain
access to your on-premises or cloud
infrastructures](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/compass/protect-against-ransomware-phase3) at
the various common points of entry. There are a lot of these tasks, so
it's important to prioritize your work here based on how fast you can
accomplish these with your current resources.

For a comprehensive view of ransomware and extortion and how to protect
your organization, use the information in the [**Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project Plan**](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/5/1/751682ca-5aae-405b-afa0-e4832138e436/RansomwareRecommendations.pptx) PowerPoint
presentation.

Here's a summary of the guidance:

:::image type="content" source="../media/summary-guidance.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the summary of the guidance in the Human-Operated Ransomware Mitigation Project Plan." lightbox="../media/summary-guidance.png":::

-   The stakes of ransomware and extortion-based attacks are high.
-   However, the attacks have weaknesses that can mitigate your  likelihood of being attacked.
-   There are three phases to configure your infrastructure to exploit attack weaknesses.
