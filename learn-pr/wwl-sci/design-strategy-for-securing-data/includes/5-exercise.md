Tailwind Trader is a fictitious home improvement retailer. It operates
retail hardware stores across the globe and online. The Tailwind Traders
CISO is aware of the opportunities offered by Azure but also understands
the need for strong security and solid cloud architecture. Without
strong security and a great point of reference architecture, the company
may have difficulty managing the Azure environment and costs, which are
hard to track and control. The CISO is interested in understanding how
Azure manages and enforces security standards.

#### Requirements

Tailwind Traders plans to make some significant changes to their Data
Security Strategy. Currently, they're using the Waterfall development
cycle to manage all applications. They have asked for your assistance
with recommendations and questions. Here are the specific requirements.

-   **Data Security.** The company has a new security optimization
    project for customer environments. The CISO wants to ensure that all
    data in rest and transit are secured and controlled in the cloud.

### Tasks

-  **Evaluate a Data Security Strategy**

     -   What could Tailwind Traders evaluate to design a Data Security
        Strategy?

         -  Evaluate a standard and explain your decision-making
            process.

             -   Tailwind Traders should evaluate the Data Protection
                Best Practices to Discover, Protect, Monitor, and
                Encrypt Sensitive Data.

     -   What security strategy could be used to Protect Data in Transit?

         -  Tailwind Traders should secure access from individual and
            multiple workstations located on-premises to an Azure
            virtual network by using Point-to-Site VPN or Site-to-Site
            VPN.

     - How are you enforcing Data Security for all users to protect their identity, data, and other assets in Microsoft Azure?
