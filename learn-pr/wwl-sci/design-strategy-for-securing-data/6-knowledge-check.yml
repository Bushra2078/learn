  title: "Design strategy for securing data"
  questions:
  - content: "What can Tailwind Traders do to ensure the organization's data is encrypted and protect against compromises of any layer of encryption?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure encryption services to enforce double encryption and provide several independent layers of encryption to protect against compromises."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Detect activity from unexpected locations or countries/regions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Detecting activity from unexpected locations will help to prioritize cloud threats, but not directly protect against encryption compromises."
    - content: "Identify and control sensitive information (DLP); respond to sensitivity labels on content."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A strategy to identify and control sensitive data does not necessarily address encryption standards."
  - content: "How can Tailwind Traders discover and manage Shadow IT in their network?"
    choices:
    - content: "Monitor user activities for anomalies, protect data when it is exfiltrated, and prevent unprotected data from being uploaded to apps."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Encrypt sensitive information in transit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Enforcing data encryption does not eliminate shadow IT."
    - content: "Create a policy which blocks downloads to unmanaged devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Blocking downloads to unmanaged devices will help ensure data confidentiality, but will not control Shadow IT."
  - content: "What can Tailwind Traders do to classify sensitive information in the Azure environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Microsoft Information Protection to define which information is sensitive."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Tune the set IP ranges for anomaly detection policies, and send feedback for alerts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tuning anomaly detection policies will not assist in classifying sensitive information."
    - content: "Ensure that sensitive web API-related data isn't stored in the browser's storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Controlling the storage of data from web APIs will mitigate threats to data, but not classify sensitive information."
