The top security challenges organizations face include:

- An increase in the number and sophistication of attacks.
- A talent shortage that is driving the need for automation, integration, and consolidation of security tools.
- Visibility into security, privacy, compliance, and governance

Organizations need to act quickly to address all the security challenges they face, but working as human speed, even if there weren't a talent shortage, isn't enough.  Organizations need to work at machine speed.

Microsoft Security Copilot is the first and only generative AI security product to help defend organizations at machine speed and scale.  It's an AI-powered security analysis tool that enables analysts to respond to threats quickly, process signals at machine speed, and assess risk exposure in minutes.

The center of Microsoft Security Copilot is the prompt bar that allows security analysts to ask questions in natural language.  You use the prompt bar to tell copilot what insights you want from your security data. Example questions could be, what are all the incidents in my enterprise or which alerts are being triggered most?  You can drop in files, URLs, or code snippets and ask for information about them or you can ask for information about incidents or alerts from other security tools.  Security Copilot uses AI to generate a response to your prompt using what it finds externally and internally to your organization.  A feature of Security Copilot is the pin board. If you find something that's useful you can pin it to the pin board.  The pin board holds the responses as you work through an investigation, dynamically updates, share them, export them and collaborate on them with others.  You can also save prompts in a prompt book so they can be used by others.

It's important to note that AI generated content can make mistakes and users can easily share feedback with Microsoft.

The information you give Copilot will only be accessible to your organization. Your data is your data, and it's protected by comprehensive enterprise compliance and security controls.  Your data isn't used to train the foundation AI models.

Security Copilot, which is currently in preview and not yet generally available, has planned integration with Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft's other security product families.
