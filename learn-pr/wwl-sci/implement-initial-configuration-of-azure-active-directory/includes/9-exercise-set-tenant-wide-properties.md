### Find the tenant ID

Azure subscriptions have a trust relationship with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD is trusted to authenticate users, services, and devices for the subscription. Each subscription has a tenant ID associated with it, and there are a few ways you can find the tenant ID for your subscription.

9. In the **Azure Active Directory** screen, in the Manage section, select **Properties**.
10. Under **Tenant properties**, locate **Tenant ID**. Tenant ID is your unique tenant identifier.

### Change the Technical contact, add your privacy info, Global privacy contact, and Privacy statement URL

Microsoft strongly recommends you add both your global privacy contact and your organization's privacy statement, so your internal employees and external guests can review your policies. Because privacy statements are uniquely created and tailored for each business, we strongly recommend you contact a lawyer for assistance.

12. Add your privacy info for your employees:
     
    - **Technical contact**. Type the email address for the person to contact for technical support within your organization.
    - **Global privacy contact**. Type the email address for the person to contact for inquiries about personal data privacy. This person is also who Microsoft contacts if there's a data breach. If there's no person listed here, Microsoft contacts your global administrators.
    - **Privacy statement URL**. Type the link to your organization's document that describes how your organization handles both internal and external guest's data privacy.
    
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you don't include either your own privacy statement or your privacy contact, your external guests will see text in the Review Permissions box that says, has not provided links to their terms for you to review. For example, a guest user will see this message when they receive an invitation to access an organization through B2B collaboration.
