operations strategy with zero trust in mind. You have learned different
strategies for designing, defining, and recommending an organizational
security strategy and architecture. You should now be able to:

-   Design a logging and auditing security strategy
-   Develop security operations for hybrid and multicloud environments
-   Design a strategy for Security Information and Event Management
    (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
-   Evaluate security workflows
-   Review security strategies for incident management
-   Evaluate security operations for technical threat intelligence
