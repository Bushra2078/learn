Tailwind Trader is a fictitious home improvement retailer. It operates
retail hardware stores across the globe and online. The Tailwind Traders
CISO is aware of the opportunities offered by Azure but also understands
the need for strong security and solid cloud architecture. Without
strong security and a great point of reference architecture, the company
may have difficulty managing the Azure environment and costs, which are
hard to track and control. The CISO is interested in understanding how
Azure manages and enforces security standards.

### Requirements

Tailwind Traders is planning to make some significant changes to their
Security Operations. They have asked for your assistance with
recommendations and questions. Here are the specific requirements.

-   **Security and Activity logs** The company has a new security
    optimization project for customer environments. The CISO wants to
    ensure that all available Azure logs are sourced and correlated
    within Microsoft Sentinel.

        performance data, or custom data provided through the API?

            process.

            -   Azure Monitor - Azure Monitor€¯collects data from managed
                sources into central data stores. This data can include
                events, performance data, or custom data provided
                through the API. After the data is collected, it's
                available for alerting, analysis, and export.

    -   What are the different ways Tailwind Traders could prevent,
        detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility into
        (and control over) the security of your Azure resources.?

        1.  Evaluate a solution and explain your decision-making
            process.

            -   Microsoft Defender for Cloud- Helps you prevent,
                detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility
                into (and control over) the security of your Azure
                resources. It provides integrated security monitoring
                and policy management across your subscriptions. It
                helps detect threats that might otherwise go unnoticed,
                and it works with a broad ecosystem of security
                solutions

How are you incorporating Azure Security Operations services available
to users to protect their data, applications, and other assets in
Microsoft Azure?
