Tailwind Trader is a fictitious home improvement retailer. It operates
retail hardware stores across the globe and online. The Tailwind Traders
CISO is aware of the opportunities offered by Azure but also understands
the need for strong security and solid cloud architecture. Without
strong security and a great point of reference architecture, the company
may have difficulty managing the Azure environment and costs, which are
hard to track and control. The CISO is interested in understanding how
Azure manages and enforces security standards.

Security Operations. They have asked for your assistance with
