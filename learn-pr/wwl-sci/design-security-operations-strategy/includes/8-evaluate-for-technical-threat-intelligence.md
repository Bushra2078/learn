Threat Intelligence teams provide context and insights to support all other functions (using a threat intelligence platform (TIP) in larger organizations). This could include many different facets including:
* Reactive technical research for active incidents
* Proactive technical research into attacker groups, attack trends, high profile attacks, emerging techniques,etc. 
* Strategic analysis, research, and insights to inform business and technical processes and priorities.

## Microsoft's threat intelligence strategy

:::image type="content" source="../media/microsoft-threat-intelligence.png" alt-text="Diagram showing Microsoft's approach to gathering, analyzing and applying threat intelligence in a feedback loop." lightbox="../media/microsoft-threat-intelligence.png":::

To be successful with threat intelligence, you must have a large diverse set of data and you have to apply it to your processes and tools. Microsoft does both.

The data that we collect from the various sources passes through a strict privacy/compliance boundary to ensure that data is only being used in ways that our customers have agreed to. Microsoft takes this responsibility very seriously. 

The data sources include the products noted earlier as well as specialized security sources, insights from dark markets (criminal forums), and learnings from incident response engagements where we help customers investigations and remediate incidents (on any given week, we are typically engaged onsite at several customers and engaged remotely with dozens more). Microsoft has dedicated work to research and help solve critical topics like disinformation, nation states, ransomware, IoT and OT security (Section 52), and more. Learnings and actionable recommendations are posted to the Microsoft Digital Defense Report (MDDR) – https://aka.ms/MDDR 

Some notable parts of this process include:

* **Data Collection and Analysis** - The data then goes through a collection and analysis phase to normalize it, apply various analytics (listed) to identify relevant security insights and findings, and publish to an internal API
* **Product Integration** - Each of Microsoft’s security capabilities then access the data to provide findings, context, and insights relative to that capability and then automatically feed new detections and insights back in to enrich other product findings.  
* **Hunters** – Additionally, human teams are constantly working with this intelligence to hunt for adversaries in various environments (Azure, Office 365, Microsoft IT, Microsoft 365 Defender Customers, etc.) as well as creating, tuning, and validating new analytics to improve the detection overall. Microsoft has over 8,500 experts working on the security challenges faced by the industry.
