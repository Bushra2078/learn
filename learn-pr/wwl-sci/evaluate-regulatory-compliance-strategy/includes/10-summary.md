In this module you learned that business risk is the starting point to
establishing a compliance strategy, since it is during the business's
risk assessment that you'll identify the regulatory compliance needs
based on the industry's requirements. You learned that operational
compliance should be in place to support the regulatory compliance needs
and the options available in Azure to help you be compliant with the
major regulatory standards. You also learned how to interpret compliance
scores using Microsoft Defender for cloud and how to recommend actions
to improve your compliance over time.

In addition, you learned how to design and validate your Azure Policy to
enforce compliance requirements and continuously monitor your
environment. As part of the compliance strategy, you also learned to
design data residency requirements and translate privacy requirements
into security solutions with proper data classification and identity
protection.
