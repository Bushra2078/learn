As you establish corporate policy and plan your governance strategies, you can use tools and services like Azure Policy, Azure Blueprints, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud to enforce and automate your organization's governance decisions.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud plays an important part in your governance strategy. It helps you stay on top of security because it:

- Provides a unified view of security across your workloads.
- Collects, searches, and analyzes security data from a variety of sources, which includes firewalls and other partner solutions.
- Provides actionable security recommendations to fix issues before they can be exploited.
- Can be used to apply security policies across your hybrid cloud workloads to ensure compliance with security standards.

The regulatory compliance dashboard in Microsoft Defender for Cloud shows your selected compliance standards with all their requirements, where supported requirements are mapped to applicable security assessments. The status of these assessments reflects your compliance with the standard. Below you have an example of the Regulatory Compliance Dashboard in Microsoft Defender for Cloud:
