When reviewing the assessments, you can select a tab for a compliance standard that is relevant to you (1). You'll see which subscriptions the standard is applied on (2), and the list of all controls for that standard (3). For the applicable controls, you can view the details of passing and failing assessments associated with that control (4), and the number of affected resources (5). Some controls are greyed out. These controls don't have any Defender for Cloud assessments associated with them. Check their requirements and assess them in your environment. Some of these might be process-related and not technical.
