Cryptography is foundational to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It also defends against cyberattacks.

On our journey through cryptography and encryption, you've seen how secret messages evolved from symmetric encryption to the modern application of asymmetric key encryption on email and online cybersecurity.

Next, you saw how hashing and digital signatures use encryption to validate identity and the authenticity of the message and content you send. Finally, you now understand why certificates are essential for maintaining good cybersecurity.

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Describe some of the basic concepts of cryptography.
- Describe encryption and its uses in cybersecurity.
- Describe hashing and digital signing.
- Describe digital certificates.
