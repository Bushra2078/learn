  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How many keys are required when using symmetric encryption?"
    choices:
    - content: "Three."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Symmetric encryption does not need that many keys."
    - content: "One."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Symmetric encryption uses one secret encryption key which is shared with all parties."
    - content: "Two."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys, a private key and a public key."
  - content: "When using asymmetric encryption, which key should not be shared?"
    choices:
    - content: "Private key."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The private key should always be kept safe and never shared."
    - content: "Public key."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Asymmetric encryption requires that you share the public key in order to turn a plaintext message into ciphertext."
    - content: "Key pair."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The key pair contains both the public and private keys."
  - content: "What is a hashing function?"
    choices:
    - content: "A hashing function is an algorithm that creates a new ciphertext message from the plaintext."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A hashing function creates a value that represents the content of plaintext and can be used to verify that the source."
    - content: "A hashing function is an algorithm that is used to decrypt ciphertext from the sender."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A hashing function creates a value that represents the content of plaintext and can be used to verify that the source."
    - content: "A hashing function is an algorithm that creates a fixed length hexadecimal value of the plaintext."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The hashing function creates a value that represents the content of plaintext and can be used to verify that the source document has not changed."
