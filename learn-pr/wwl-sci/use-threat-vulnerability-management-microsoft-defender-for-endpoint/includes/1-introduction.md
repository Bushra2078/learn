Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) discovers vulnerable and misconfigured devices based on known attack vectors and software vulnerabilities. 

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that has implemented Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.   You are responsible for working with the endpoint management team to remediate weaknesses reported by Threat Vulnerability Management. 

A new threat is listed in the Threat Analytics dashboard.  You can quickly see that none of your devices are vulnerable to this new threat because TVM has already provided the analysis required on your devices.
