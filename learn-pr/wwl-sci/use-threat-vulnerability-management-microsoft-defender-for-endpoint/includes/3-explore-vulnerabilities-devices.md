The Threat & Vulnerability Management area provides the following device vulnerability information

## Software inventory

The Software inventory page opens with a list of software installed in your network, including the vendor name, weaknesses found, threats associated with them, exposed devices, impact to exposure score, and tags.  You can filter the list view based on weaknesses found in the software, threats associated with them, and tags like whether the software has reached end-of-support.

## Weaknesses

The Weaknesses page lists the software vulnerabilities your devices are exposed to by listing the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID. You can also view the severity, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) rating, prevalence in your organization, corresponding breach, threat insights, and more.

## Event timeline

The Event timeline is a risk news feed that helps you interpret how risk is introduced into the organization through new vulnerabilities or exploits. You can view events that may impact your organization's risk. For example, you can find new vulnerabilities that were introduced, vulnerabilities that became exploitable, exploits that were added to an exploit kit, and more.  Event timeline also tells the story of your exposure score and Microsoft Secure Score for Devices so you can determine the cause of large changes. Events can impact your devices or your score for devices. Reduce your exposure by addressing what needs to be remediated based on the prioritized security recommendations.

## Vulnerable devices report

The Reports area has a Vulnerable devices report.  The report shows graphs and bar charts with vulnerable device trends and current statistics. The goal is for you to understand the breadth and scope of your device exposure.

The graphs and charts include:

### Severity level graphs

Each device is counted only once according to the most severe vulnerability found on that device.

### Exploit availability graphs

Each device is counted only once based on the highest level of known exploit.

### Vulnerability age graphs

Each device is counted only once under the oldest vulnerability publication date. Older vulnerabilities have a higher chance of being exploited.

### Vulnerable devices by operating system platform graphs

The number of devices on each operating system that are exposed due to software vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerable devices by Windows 10 version graphs

The number of devices on each Windows 10 version that are exposed due to vulnerable applications or OS.
