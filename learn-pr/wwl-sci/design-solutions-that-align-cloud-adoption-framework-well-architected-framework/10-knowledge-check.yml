  questions:
    - content: "What is the main objective of the Cloud Adoption Framework?"
      choices:
        - content: "To provide guidelines on how to make applications more secure."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While security is an important part, the main objective of the Cloud Adoption Framework is to provide a set of best practices and guidelines for organizations that are adopting cloud technologies."
        - content: "To provide a methodology to build and deploy cloud infrastructure."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The Cloud Adoption Framework provides a clear step-by-step guidance for IT professionals to create, test, and deploy cloud resources effectively while applying best practices."
        - content: "To offer a way to migrate entire workloads to the cloud without any obstacles."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Migration is a crucial part of every cloud adoption process, but it's not the only objective of the Cloud Adoption Framework."
        - content: "To offer a complete list of available cloud services with their descriptions."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Cloud Adoption Framework doesn't provide such a list. Microsoft Azure documentation is the recommended source of information about specific Azure services."

    - content: "What is the Well Architected Framework?"
      choices:
        - content: "A framework to develop resilient and fault-tolerant serverless applications."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Well-Architected Framework is a tool designed to help developers build and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. It applies to all types of cloud architectures, not just serverless."
        - content: "A framework that focuses exclusively on security-related design decisions for cloud-based applications."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While the Well-Architected Framework emphasizes security principles, it covers more timeless than just security, including cost optimization, reliability, performance efficiency."
        - content: "An AWS blueprint designed to expedite deployment times using predefined infrastructure stacks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Well-Architected Framework is not an AWS-specific framework. Its focus on architecture patterns that can be applied to any cloud provider as well companies own data centers."
        - content: "A methodology developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to review and critique cloud architectures."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The Well-Architected Framework is a systematic approach that provides customers with a consistent and methodically validated assessment of their cloud architectures based on available best practices."

    - content: "What are Azure Landing Zones?"
      choices:
        - content: "A feature in Azure used to authenticate device access to cloud environments."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure landing zones don't relate to device management or authentication."
        - content: "A system designed to manage identity and access for cloud resources in Azure."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Identity and Access Management are concerns handled by Azure Active Directory, but Azure Landing Zones aren't directly related to user identities."
        - content: "A prescribed architecture for configuring a secure and scalable cloud environment."
          isCorrect: true

          explanation: "Azure offers multiple payment methods, but Azure Landing Zones are not directly related to billing or payment methods."

    - content: "What is DevSecOps?"
      choices:
        - content: "A practice that ensures system uptime by maintaining optimal replica volumes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "DevSecOps isn't concerned with replica volumes of systems, which refers to replication strategies used in high availability deployment scenarios."
        - content: "A security model used by developers to certify that code changes do not affect production environments."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There's no certification process involved in DevSecOps. The idea behind DevSecOps is that security mechanisms are integrated throughout the development cycle to increase the overall security posture."
        - content: "A set of principles designed to integrate security testing and evaluation into the software development lifecycle (SDLC)."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "DevSecOps is short for Development, Security, and Operations, which aims to integrate security activities into all stages of the SDLC to achieve application and infrastructure resilience."
