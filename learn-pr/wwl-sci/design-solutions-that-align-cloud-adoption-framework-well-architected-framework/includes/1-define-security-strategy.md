In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Understand the Cloud Adoption Framework and how it can be used to accelerate and secure an organizations move to the cloud.
- Understand the Well-Architected Framework and how it can be used to design solutions in the cloud that adhere to sound design principles including security.

The content in the module will help you prepare for the certification exam SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect.

## Prerequisites

- Conceptual knowledge of security policies, requirements, zero trust architecture, and management of hybrid environments
- Working experience with zero trust strategies, applying security policies, and developing security requirements based on business goals

## Define a security strategy

The ultimate objectives for a security organization don't change with adoption of cloud services, but how those objectives are achieved will change. Security teams must still focus on reducing business risk from attacks and work to get confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances built into all information systems and data.

### Modernize your security strategy

Security teams need to modernize strategies, architectures, and technology as the organization adopts cloud and operates it over time. While the size and number of changes can initially seem daunting, the modernization of the security program allows security to shed some painful burdens associated with legacy approaches. An organization can temporarily operate with legacy strategy and tooling, but this approach is difficult to sustain with the pace of change in cloud and the threat environment:

-   Security teams are likely to be left out of cloud adoption decision making if they take a legacy mindset of "arms-length" security where the answer always starts with "no" (instead of working together with IT and business teams to reduce risk while enabling the business).
-   Security teams will have a difficult time detecting and defending against cloud attacks if they use only legacy on-premises tooling and exclusively adhere to network perimeter-only doctrine for all defenses and monitoring.

### Monitor and protect at cloud-scale

Defending at cloud-scale is a significant transformation effort, mandating the use of cloud-native detection and automation capabilities, and the introduction of an identity perimeter to help monitor and protect cloud and mobile assets.

-   The [Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) helps you incorporate modern authentication and authorization mechanisms into your applications.
-   [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview) provides cloud-native security analytics and threat intelligence across your organization, enabling improved threat detection that makes use of large repositories of threat intelligence, and the nearly unlimited processing and storage capabilities of the cloud.

We recommend that security teams take an agile approach to modernizing security—rapidly modernizing the most critical aspects of the strategy, continuously improving in increments, moving forward.

### Security of the cloud and from the cloud

As your organization adopts cloud services, security teams will work toward two main objectives:

-   **Security of the cloud** (securing cloud resources): Security should be integrated into the planning and operation of cloud services to ensure that those core security assurances are consistently applied across all resources.
-   **Security from the cloud** (using the cloud to transform security): Security should immediately start planning and thinking about how to use cloud technologies to modernize security tools and processes, particularly natively integrated security tools. Security tools are increasingly being hosted in the cloud—providing capabilities that are difficult or impossible to do in an on-premises environment.
