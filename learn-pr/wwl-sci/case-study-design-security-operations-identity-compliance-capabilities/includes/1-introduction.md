## Introduction to case study

This case study is divided into four parts:

1. **The case study description** including:
    1. **The background scenario** of a company and some of its business needs in cybersecurity and a diagram of their initial architecture 
    1. **Design requirements** which will need to be met with a final solution
    1. **Conceptual questions** to consider the approach and parameters for a solution
    1. **Technical questions** - to begin identifying specific capabilities which will meet the identified business needs
1. **The case study answers**, which break down an analysis of the design requirements as well as answer the conceptual and technical questions.
1. **A conceptual walkthrough video** - shows the proposed architecture at a high level, including which capabilities were selected for the final solution and how the elements fit together
1. **A technical walkthrough** - inspecting and verifying some parts of the proposed architecture
