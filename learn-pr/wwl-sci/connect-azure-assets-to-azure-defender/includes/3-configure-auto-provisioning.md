Microsoft Defender for Cloud collects data from your Azure virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, IaaS containers, and non-Azure (including on-premises) machines to monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats.

Data collection is required to provide visibility into missing updates, misconfigured OS security settings, endpoint protection status, and health and threat protection. Data collection is only needed for compute resources (VMs, virtual machine scale sets, IaaS containers, and non-Azure computers). You can benefit from Defender for Cloud even if you don’t provision agents. However, you'll have limited security, and the capabilities listed above aren't supported.

Data is collected using:

- The Log Analytics agent, which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and copies the data to your workspace for analysis. Examples of such data are operating system type and version, operating system logs (Windows event logs), running processes, machine name, IP addresses, and logged in user.

- Security extensions, such as the Azure Policy Add-on for Kubernetes, which can also provide data to Security Center regarding specialized resource types.

## Why use auto provisioning?

Any of the agents and extensions described on this page can be installed manually. However, auto provisioning reduces management overhead by installing all required agents and extensions on existing - and new - machines to ensure faster security coverage for all supported resources.

## How does auto provisioning work?

Defender for Clouds's auto provisioning settings has a toggle for each type of supported extension. When you enable auto provisioning of an extension, you assign the appropriate Deploy if not exists policy to ensure that the extension is provisioned on all existing and future resources of that type.

## Enable auto provisioning of the Log Analytics agent

When automatic provisioning is on for the Log Analytics agent, Defender for Cloud deploys the agent on all supported Azure VMs and any new ones created.

To enable auto provisioning of the Log Analytics agent:

1. From Defender for Clouds's menu, select **Environment settings**.

1. Select the relevant subscription.

1. In the **Auto provisioning** page, set the status of auto provisioning for the Log Analytics agent to **On**.

1. From the configuration options pane, define the workspace to use.

Connect Azure VMs to the default workspace(s) created by Defender for Cloud - Defender for Cloud creates a new resource group and default workspace in the same geolocation and connects the agent to that workspace. If a subscription contains VMs from multiple geolocations, Defender for Cloud creates multiple workspaces to ensure compliance with data privacy requirements.

The naming convention for the workspace and resource group is:

- Workspace: DefaultWorkspace-[subscription-ID]-[geo]
- Resource Group: DefaultResourceGroup-[geo]

Defender for Cloud automatically enables Defender for Cloud solution(s) on the workspace per the pricing tier set for the subscription.

Connect Azure VMs to a different workspace - From the dropdown list, select the workspace to store collected data. The dropdown list includes all workspaces across all of your subscriptions. You can use this option to collect data from virtual machines running in different subscriptions and store it all in your selected workspace.

If you already have an existing Log Analytics workspace, you might want to use the same workspace (requires read and write permissions on the workspace). This option is useful if you're using a centralized workspace in your organization and want to use it for security data collection. Learn more in Manage access to log data and workspaces in Azure Monitor.

If your selected workspace already has a Security or Defender for Cloud Free solution enabled, the pricing will be set automatically. If not, install a Defender for Cloud solution on the workspace.

## Enable auto provisioning of extensions

To enable automatic provisioning of an extension other than the Log Analytics agent:

1. From Defender for Clouds's menu in the Azure portal, select **Environment settings**.

1. Select the relevant subscription.

1. Select **Auto provisioning**.

1. If you're enabling auto provisioning for the **Microsoft Dependency agent**, ensure the Log Analytics agent is set to auto deploy too.

1. Toggle the status to On for the relevant extension.

1. Select **Save**. The Azure policy is assigned, and a remediation task is created.

## Windows security event options for the Log Analytics agent

Selecting a data collection tier in Defender for Cloud only affects the storage of security events in your Log Analytics workspace. The Log Analytics agent will still collect and analyze the security events required for Defender for Clouds’s threat protection, regardless of the level of security events you choose to store in your workspace. Choosing to store security events enables investigation, search, and auditing of those events in your workspace.

Defender for Cloud is required for storing Windows security event data.  Storing data in Log Analytics might incur more charges for data storage.

### Information for Microsoft Sentinel users

Users of Microsoft Sentinel: note that security events collection within the context of a single workspace can be configured from either Microsoft Defender for Cloud or Microsoft Sentinel, but not both. If you're planning to add Microsoft Sentinel to a workspace that is already getting alerts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and its set to collect Security Events, you have two options:

- Leave the Security Events collection in Defender for Cloud as is. You'll be able to query and analyze these events in Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud. However, you won't be able to monitor the connector's connectivity status or change its configuration in Microsoft Sentinel. If monitoring or customizing the connector is important to you, consider the second option.

- Disable Security Events collection in Defender for Cloud (by setting Windows security events to None in the configuration of your Log Analytics agent). Then add the Security Events connector in Microsoft Sentinel. As with the first option, you'll be able to query and analyze events in both Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud, but you'll now be able to monitor the connector's connectivity status or change its configuration in - and only in - Microsoft Sentinel.

### What event types are stored for "Common" and "Minimal"?

These sets were designed to address typical scenarios. Make sure to evaluate which one fits your needs before implementing it.

To determine the events for the Common and Minimal options, we worked with customers and industry standards to learn about the unfiltered frequency of each event and their usage. We used the following guidelines in this process:

- Minimal - Make sure that this set covers only events that might indicate a successful breach and important events that have a low volume. For example, this set contains user successful and failed logins (event IDs 4624, 4625), but it doesn’t contain sign outs, which is important for auditing, but not meaningful for detection and has relatively high volume. Most of the data volume of this set is the login events and process creation event (event ID 4688).

- Common - Provide a full user audit trail in this set. For example, this set contains both user logins and user sign-outs (event ID 4634). We include auditing actions like security group changes, key domain controller Kerberos operations, and other events that are recommended by industry organizations.

Events with low volume were included in the Common set as the main motivation to choose it over all the events is to reduce the volume and not filter out specific events.
