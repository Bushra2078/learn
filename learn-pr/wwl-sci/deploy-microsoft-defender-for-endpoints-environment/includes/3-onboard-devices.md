- Verify that the device fulfills the minimum requirements

- Depending on the device, follow the configuration steps provided in the onboarding section of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

- Use the appropriate management tool and deployment method for your devices

- Run a detection test to verify that the devices are properly onboarded and reporting to the service
