-   **Best practices** are recommended practices that are the most
    effective or efficient way to address a particular discipline or
    problem. Best practices help you avoid mistakes and ensure that your
    resources and effort aren't wasted.

-   **Follow best practices unless you have a reason not to.**
    Organizations should follow well defined and well-reasoned best
    practices unless there is a specific reason not to. Best practices
    are not unquestionably perfect and applicable to all situations, but
    they have been proven to work elsewhere so you should not ignore
    them without good reason.

-   **Apply and integrate best practices.** Like any guidance or advice,
    best practices only have value if they are applied in practice.
    Security best practices must be integrated into people's skills and
    habits, repeatable processes of your organization, and technology
    architecture and implementation.

-   **Key Microsoft security best practice sources** - Microsoft has
    embedded best practices in various forms of guidance that includes
    the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures, Azure Security
    Benchmark, The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), and Microsoft
    security best practices. These best practices come come from several
    sources including

    -   **Technology intent and design** -- from building and operating
        both hyperscale technology platforms and security capabilities.

    -   **Effective common practices** --from what has been observed to
        work well across a large variety of organizations.

    -   **Bright spots and early adopters** -- from learnings at
        organization who adopt new and emerging technology early.

-   **Security best practices evolve over time.** Microsoft security
    best practices reflect the current reality of the world and
    regularly update them to stay current.

-   **The Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA)**
    diagrams and sections are a key source of security best practices
    for many topics including zero trust user access, security
    operations, multi-cloud and cross-platform capabilities, operational
    technology (OT), attack chains and technical capability coverage,
    Azure native security controls, and security roles and
    responsibilities.

-   **Azure Security Benchmark (ASB)** provides security best practices
    for infrastructure and development platforms across a hybrid of
    Microsoft Azure, on-premises datacenters, and other cloud providers
    like AWS and GCP. The ASB includes two types of guidance:

    -   **Security controls:** Security recommendations that are
        generally applicable across environment

    -   **Service baselines:** Specific interpretation of these security
        controls to individual Azure services to provide prescriptive
        recommendations on the service's security configuration.

-   **Security best practices for capabilities and controls.** These
    best practices focus on capabilities and controls to ensure that
    security has the tools they need to be effective and efficient.
    While security technology doesn't improve security on its own or
    replace the need for security experts, technology automates
    processes and empower people to do more.

-   **Security best practices for insider risk and external attacks.**
    Effective security programs must protect against both insider risk
    as well as attacks by external threat actors. You can find best
    practices for protecting from insider and external attacks
    throughout the MCRA and ASB. You should have an understanding of the
    **attack chain** concept that adapts of the 'kill chain' concept
    from military conflict to cybersecurity. This helps you understand
    attacks and plan security controls by viewing them as a sequential
    chain of events.

-   **Security best practices for Zero Trust** are critical to success
    today. A Zero Trust approach to security helps security become agile
    to keep up with changing threats, changes to cloud platforms, and
    changes in business models (which are responding to a rapidly
    evolving world). You can find best practices for adopting a Zero
    Trust approach to security throughout the MCRA and ASB.

-   **Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP)** outlines quick wins
    across different initiatives in the Zero Trust transformation of a
    security program, strategy, and architecture. This guidance provides
    quick wins and incremental progress to help you prioritize items
    with the most security and productivity increases from the least
    amount of time and resources. The Zero Trust Rapid Modernization
    Plan (RaMP) is included in the MCRA.
