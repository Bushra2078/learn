- **Best practices** are recommended ways to do things that have been found to be most effective or efficient. Best practices help you avoid mistakes and ensure that your resources and effort aren't wasted.

- **Follow best practices unless you have a reason not to.** - Organizations should follow well-defined and well-reasoned best practices unless there's a specific reason to avoid them. Best practices aren't perfectly applicable to all situations, but they've been proven to work elsewhere so you shouldn't ignore or alter them without good reason.

-   **Apply and integrate best practices.** best practices only have value if they're applied in practice. Security best practices must be integrated into people's skills and habits, processes of your organization, and technology architecture.

-   **Key Microsoft security best practice sources** - Microsoft has included best practices in reference materials such as the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA), Microsoft cloud security benchmark, The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), and Microsoft security best practices. These best practices come from several sources including:

    - **Technology intent and design** - from building and operating both hyperscale technology platforms and security capabilities.
    - **Effective common practices** - from what has been observed to work well across a large sample of organizations.
    - **Bright spots and early adopters** - from learnings at organizations who adopt new technologies early.

-   **Security best practices evolve over time.** - Microsoft security best practices reflect the current reality of the world and we update them regularly.
-   **The Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA)** diagrams and sections are a key source of security best practices for many topics including zero trust user access, security operations, multicloud and cross-platform capabilities, operational technology (OT), attack chains, technical capability coverage, Azure native security controls, and security roles and responsibilities.

- **Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)** provides security best practices for infrastructure and development platforms across a hybrid of
    Microsoft Azure, on-premises datacenters, and other cloud providers. The MCSB includes two types of guidance:
    - **Security controls:** Security recommendations that are applicable across environments and services
    - **Service baselines:** Application of these security controls to individual Azure services to provide prescriptive recommendations on the service's security configuration

- **Security best practices for capabilities and controls.** These best practices focus on capabilities and controls to ensure that security has the tools they need to be effective and efficient. Although technology doesn't improve security on its own or replace the need for security experts, technology is important to automate processes and allow people to focus on other activities.

- **Security best practices for insider risk and external attacks.** Effective security programs must protect against both insider risk
    and attacks by external threat actors. You can find best practices for protecting from insider and external attacks throughout the MCRA and MCSB. You should have an understanding of the **attack chain** concept that adapts the 'kill chain' concept from military conflict to cybersecurity. This model helps you understand attacks by viewing them as a sequential chain of events.

- **Security best practices for Zero Trust** are critical to success today. A Zero Trust approach to security helps security become agile
    to keep up with changing threats, changes to cloud platforms, and changes in business models..

- **Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP)** provides best practices that help you prioritize your security modernization. This RaMP identifies the most effective controls for the most relevant and common attacks that require the least amount of investment of time, effort, and resources. Included in MCRA.
