In today's modern always connected world, application have become central to how we engage with it, from talking to your friends or colleagues, to shopping and banking. Applications make all this possible. All reputable application and software developers aim to build robust and hardened software and applications that deliver the functionality that we need, along with the security to keep cybercriminals at bay. A hardened application is one where the developer has tested it against all the latest cyberattacks before making it available to download. The software developers will offer patches and upgrades to ensure that your user experience is the best and safest it can be.

But cybercriminals are unrelenting in their desire to obtain your data and will look to exploit any weakness or vulnerability. There are few things that you can do, either as an individual or as an enterprise organization to protect the apps that you use.

## Patching promptly

Operating systems and most mainstream applications, for example word processors, music apps, and the like, will issue updates or patches. Some of these offer improvements in functionality, but the majority will be to patch a known security weakness or vulnerability in the software, or to improve the security of the application. Cybercriminals and hackers will focus on these applications looking for exploitable vulnerabilities. When one is identified, they will move quickly to write malicious code. If successful this malware can take control of the application or intercept data being accessed by it, until the next patch is released, when the cycle starts over again.

As part of a robust security process or policy, you should ensure all applications used on your device are kept up to date with the latest patches or updates.

## Application configuration

Most applications are developed with a balance of security and usability in mind. All applications will come with a default configuration designed for optimal usage and to allow access to as much of the application as is possible. Some, for example, may have a default user account, for example, admin, with a standard default password, like admin. Cybercriminals are quick to identify these vulnerabilities, and exploit them by using default settings to gain access to your applications. It's therefore vitally important that you check your application configuration settings and where possible change the passwords on default accounts and settings. This small step can often thwart an attacker and improve the confidentiality of your data and the integrity of your application.

## Privacy settings

In today's modern world, every activity that you carry out in your application be that an instant message application or using your browser, and all the rest, is tracked and recorded. While a small part of this is so the developers can improve the application, the majority of the data collected is used so that advertisers can offer you targeted adverts based on the things you're looking at or doing.

All applications give you a degree of control over what data is collected. These are called privacy settings. These settings with vary with each application. For example, a map application may have privacy settings that prevent it from recording the routes you've used. Or a shopping application can be told not to remember the items that you were browsing.

It's good practice to locate the privacy settings and tailor them to what you want.

## Cookies

Browsers use cookies to hold details about what you were doing on a specific website from the last thing you searched for, to passwords or other personal data. Some measures have been introduced to try to limit the amount of data that is retained in cookies and on the website. A cybercriminal could exploit your browser and access these cookies to gain information and data.

Every browser gives you the ability to clean up unused cookies or to remove all cookies from your browser. It's good practice to periodically do a clean-up of all your cookies. However, there is another way to manage your cookies and that is to use the private browsing window in your browser, you may have seen them as incognito, or privacy windows. This window offers a higher level of security, to let you browse more confidence. When you close the browser window, all cookies and any browsing history are automatically deleted.

## Using verified applications

Only a handful of years ago, the only way to get an application was to go to a shop and buy it, take the box home and use the CD-ROM to install it on your computer. For all its antiquated aspects, this was by far the safest way to obtain and then use software. The Internet has made the world a smaller place, and now it's possible to obtain your applications from the comfort of your chosen device without ever having to go outside. Online shops selling applications are everywhere, offering the best opportunity for you to find the app you're looking for. But for every genuine shop selling an app, there is likely to be one offering a cheaper version, which might contain some unwanted additions.

A cybercriminal might take a copy of the latest or bestselling app and hack it to include malware. Then they can make it available through a store, selling it cheaper than anywhere else. We all like a bargain, especially if it means getting the latest app cheaper than anyone else. The compromised app may well behave exactly as the genuine one, but underneath the hood the cybercriminal is able to search your device for personal or sensitive data, which they can then extract and use for their own purposes.

As a matter of good practice, you should always download your apps from verified and trusted application store.
