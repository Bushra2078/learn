In today’s digitally connected world, there is an application to do just about anything. Applications influence and shape so many aspects of our everyday life, including how we interact with our friends, how we work, what goods and services we buy and how we buy them, how we learn, and even how we spend our free time. Because applications play such an important role in our personal and professional lives, they're an attractive target for cybercriminals who are looking to exploit any opportunity they can.

Here, you’ll learn how to describe what applications are, relative to other types of software, how applications can become attack vectors for cybercriminals, and the steps you can take to reduce the risk and give you the confidence that the apps you use are safe.

By completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe what are applications.
- Describe the threat landscape of applications.
- Describe common application-based security controls.
