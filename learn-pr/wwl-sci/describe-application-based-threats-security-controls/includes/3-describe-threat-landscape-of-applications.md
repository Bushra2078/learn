Applications are available and used for just about anything, from home and personal use, to work and school. They're a fundamental part of our daily life. They empower us by making difficult things easier. At the same time, they actively collect and hold vast amounts of data about what we do, who our friends are, where we've been, what we spend our money on and what our hobbies are, and much more. Cybercriminals are fully aware of how much data is held and accessed by these applications and will look for any weakness in the application they can exploit.

Protecting our data, whether you're an individual or a big corporation is essential. Understanding how applications can be compromised, and where these threats come from will improve your application security and improve the confidentiality of any stored or accessed data.

## Applications from untrustworthy origins

The ability to download applications to your device, be that a computer, smartphone, or tablet has become easier and easier. For the majority, we all use the larger well-established application stores. Some of these stores will verify the authenticity of the applications before they list them and will prohibit certain types of applications being sold through their platform.

This has given rise to other places to download applications, where there is little or no restriction on the apps that are available and little verification on the authenticity of the apps. Not every app on these stores is bad. However, a cybercriminal can create and package source code, give it the name of a legitimate application that users might be familiar with, then uploaded it on an application hosting site alongside legitimate applications.

Installing or running applications from untrustworthy sources can result in becoming the victim of a cyberattack.

## Applications with inherent vulnerabilities

While application developers strive to ensure their apps are secure, it's impossible to guarantee one-hundred percent protection. Cybercriminals will look for any vulnerability they can exploit. While there are many different types of application vulnerabilities, two of the more common ones are open-source and zero-day vulnerabilities.

### Open-Source vulnerabilities

Software developers will often create libraries of common functions that they’ve developed to solve a specific problem. Open-Source libraries are public to everyone, and the source code is usually freely available. When an application developer wants to solve a specific problem, they'll check to see if there is an Open-Source solution first. One of the benefits of Open-Source is that issues and vulnerabilities are publicly identified and fixed. However, these Open-Source libraries are also available to cybercriminals who will look for ways to exploit them. Developers need to stay current on the latest version of any Open-Source libraries they've used as components in their applications to avoid them becoming the subject of a cybercriminal exploit.

### Zero-day vulnerabilities

Cybercriminals conduct detailed reconnaissance of applications, searching the code for any flaws they can exploit. Any flaw that is previously unknown to the application owner and unpatched is considered a zero-day vulnerability.  When a cybercriminal finds a zero-day vulnerability, they won’t publicize it. Instead, they’ll exploit it. For example, suppose a banking app has a zero-day vulnerability, a cybercriminal might have noticed this, and use this vulnerability to quietly steal information and money from users across the application.  The name, zero-day, stems from the number of days a developer has from when a vulnerability is identified to when a fix is available, which is zero days.

## Browser-based threats

Internet browsers may be our gateway to the Internet, but they're also an application. Accordingly, most threats that you’ll come across manifest themselves through browser activity. Here are some of the more common browser-based threats:

### Cookie-based attacks

You may have heard the term cookies, but do you really know what they are? A cookie is a simple plaintext file that contains small bits of data, for instance, your user credentials, last search you made, last purchased item, etc. The purpose of cookies is to enhance your browser experience and make surfing easier, by simplifying the need to continuously log in to the site.

One common type of cookie-attack is called *session replay*. If the cybercriminal is able to intercept or eavesdrop on your communications, then they are able to steal the cookie data, and your login data, and use it access the website as if they were you.

### Typosquatting

*Typosquatting* is a type of browser-based attack where a cybercriminal obtains deliberately misspelled domain names based on popular websites, where they can put their own malicious code, disguised as a legitimate website for the domain. The users will then mistake the malicious website for the legitimate website they wanted to visit. If the users enter any personal information on the website, or follow instructions on the website, they’ve become victims of the cyberattack.
