This unit will provide an overview of the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for cloud, which provides extensive capabilities for integrating posture management and workload protection.

## What is Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) with a set of security measures and practices designed to protect cloud-based applications from various cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Defender for Cloud combines the capabilities of:

-   A development security operations (DevSecOps) solution that unifies security management at the code level across multicloud and multiple-pipeline environments
-   A cloud security posture management (CSPM) solution that surfaces actions that you can take to prevent breaches
-   A cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) with specific protections for servers, containers, storage, databases, and other workloads

## Secure cloud applications

Defender for Cloud helps you to incorporate good security practices early during the software development process, or DevSecOps. You can protect your code management environments and your code pipelines, and get insights into your development environment security posture from a single location. Defender for Cloud currently includes Defender for DevOps.

Todayâ€™s applications require security awareness at the code, infrastructure, and runtime levels to make sure that deployed applications are hardened against attacks.

Findings from Defender for DevOps, such as IaC misconfigurations and exposed secrets, can then be correlated with other contextual cloud security insights to prioritize remediation in code.                            | Connect [Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-devops) and [GitHub](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-github) repositories to Defender for Cloud             | [Defender for DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/)                          |

## Improve your security posture

The security of your cloud and on-premises resources depends on proper configuration and deployment. Defender for Cloud recommendations identify the steps that you can take to secure your environment.

Defender for Cloud includes Foundational CSPM (Free) capabilities for free. You can also enable advanced CSPM capabilities by enabling paid Defender plans.

## Protect cloud workloads

Proactive security principles require that you implement security practices that protect your workloads from threats. Cloud workload protections (CWP) surface workload-specific recommendations that lead you to the right security controls to protect your workloads.

When your environment is threatened, security alerts right away indicate the nature and severity of the threat so you can plan your response. After you identify a threat in your environment, you need to quickly respond to limit the risk to your resources.
