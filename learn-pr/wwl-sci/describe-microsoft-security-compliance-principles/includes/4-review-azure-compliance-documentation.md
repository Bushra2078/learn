If your organization needs to comply with legal or regulatory standards, and uses any Azure services, Microsoft SaaS applications including Microsoft 365, Dynamics, or the Power Platform, you will find the Azure compliance documentation page helpful.

You'll find links to documents and articles that explain the regulations. It also has links to audits, reports, certificates, FAQs, and much more.

To make it easier to find, compliance documentation is grouped geographically, and by industry. You can find compliance documentation that is relevant to everyone, relevant to the USA, or relevant to other regions. Financial services, health, and media and manufacturing documentation is also grouped together.

You'll also find template audit documents that you can tailor to your needs. Anyone can review and use the documentation as a reference to help them to understand and keep up to date with regulations. To explore the different compliance documentation available, see Azure compliance documentation in the Learn More section below.
