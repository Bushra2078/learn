Increasing your Azure solution security by ensuring that administrative roles are protected and managed is a must. Explore how to use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to protect your data and resources. In this module, you will learn how to create an access strategy, configure and assign PIM roles and resources accurately, and manage emergency access accounts.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

 -  Define a privileged access strategy for administrative users (resources, roles, approvals, thresholds).
 -  Configure PIM for Azure AD roles.
 -  Configure PIM for Azure resources.
 -  Assign roles.
 -  Manage PIM requests.
 -  Analyze PIM audit history and reports.
 -  Create and manage emergency access accounts.

## What is Azure Active Directory Privileged Identity Management?

PIM is a service in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. Such resources include those in Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services, such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that an Azure AD Premium 2 license is needed to use this capability.

\#\#\# Reasons to use

Organizations want to minimize the number of people who have access to secure information or resources, because that reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting that access or an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource. However, users still need to carry out privileged operations in Azure AD, Azure, Microsoft 365, or SaaS apps. Organizations can give users just-in-time privileged access to Azure resources and Azure AD, while managing the need for oversight of what those users are doing with their administrator privileges.

### What does it do?

PIM provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources that you care about. Key features of PIM include:

 -  Provide just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources.
 -  Assign time-bound access to resources using start and end dates.
 -  Require approval to activate privileged roles.
 -  Enforce multifactor authentication to activate any role.
 -  Use justification to understand why users activate.
 -  Get notifications when privileged roles are activated.
 -  Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles.
 -  Download audit history for internal or external audit.

### What can I do with it?

Once you set up PIM, you will see tasks, manage, and activity options in the left navigation menu. As an administrator, you will choose between options such as managing Azure AD roles, managing Azure resource roles, or privileged access groups. When you choose what you want to manage, you will see the appropriate set of options.
