When you configure automation in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint you set options in multiple areas that all rely on each other's settings.  First, you configure environment settings on the Advanced features page.  Next, you assign remediation levels to Device groups.  Device groups provide two primary functions; set the remediation level, set security access. Design Device groups to meet both of these functional requirements.
