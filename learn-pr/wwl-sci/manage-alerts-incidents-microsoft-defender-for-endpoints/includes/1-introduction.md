Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides a purpose-driven user interface to manage and investigate security incidents and alerts.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that has implemented Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and your job is to remediate incidents.  You are assigned an incident with alerts related to a suspicious PowerShell command line.

You start by reviewing the incident and understand all the related alerts, devices, and evidence.  You open the alert page to review the Alert Story.  This alert looks to be a typical attack vector that Defender for Endpoint identified and has performed an automated investigation.  Defender is now waiting for the remediation action approval.  You approve the action and close the case.
