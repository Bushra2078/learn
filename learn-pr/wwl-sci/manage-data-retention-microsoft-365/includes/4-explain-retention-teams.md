Teams is a solution with content stored across the different Microsoft 365 services and Azure subsystems that provide instant messaging, conversations, and calling features. How retention works for Teams is therefore dependent on the type of content to preserve or delete:

- **Items can be retained and deleted by using retention policies for Teams**: Chat messages and channel messages, including embedded images, tables, hypertext links and links to other Teams messages and files. Chat messages include all the names of the people in the chat, and channel messages include the team name and the message title (if supplied).

- **Teams messages in private channels are not included**, and reactions from others in the form of emoticons are not included.

- **Emails and files that you use with Teams are not included in retention policies for Teams**. These items require a separate retention policy configured for Exchange locations to protect the group mailbox.

Retention policies with Teams locations can retain chats and channel messages in Teams, which are ingested from the original storage location in an Azure Cosmos DB into a hidden folder in the group mailbox. To retain other email messages sent to a Teams retention policy with Exchange locations and the group mailbox in scope is required.

> It is important to understand where the various content of a Team is stored to create the right Retention Policies. When using Retention Labels, the storage location of the labeled elements does not matter.

## Teams Retention Functionality

After a retention policy is configured for chat and channel messages, a timer job from the Exchange service periodically evaluates items in the hidden folder where these Teams messages are stored. The timer job takes up to seven days to run. When these items have expired their retention period, they are moved to the SubstrateHolds folder—another hidden folder that's in every user or group mailbox to store "soft-deleted" items before they are permanently deleted.

After a retention policy is configured for chat and channel messages, the paths the content takes depend on whether the retention policy is to **retain and then delete**, to **retain only**, or **delete only**.

The following table provides an overview of the different ways content is held or removed by retention policies for Teams:

| **Step**| (1) **If a chat or channel message is edited or deleted** by the user during the retention period…| (2) **If a chat or channel message is not deleted** during the retention period…|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **retain and delete**| The original message is copied (if edited) or moved (if deleted) to the SubstrateHolds folder within 21 days. The message is stored there until the retention period expires and then the message is permanently deleted within 24 hours.| The message is moved to the SubstrateHolds folder after the retention period expires. This action takes up to 7 days from the expiry date. When the message is in the SubstrateHolds folder, it is then permanently deleted within 24 hours.|
| **retain-only**| A copy of the original message is created in the SubstrateHolds folder within 21 days, and retained there until the retention period expires. Then the message is permanently deleted from the SubstrateHolds folder within 24 hours.| Nothing happens before and after the retention period; the message remains in its original location.|
| **delete-only**| At the end of the retention period, the message is moved to the SubstrateHolds folder. This action takes up to seven days from the expiry date. Then the message is permanently deleted from the SubstrateHolds folder within 24 hours.| The item is moved to the SubstrateHolds folder within 21 days where it is then permanently deleted within 24 hours.|

## Important Considerations

Because the Teams storage locations are complex, there are several other considerations to make, when configuring retention policies for Teams:

- Channel meeting messages are stored the same way as channel messages and Teams channel messages location is required for retention.

- Impromptu meeting messages are stored in the same way as group chat messages why the Teams chats location is required for retention.

- For guest users in a meeting that your organization hosts, a shadow mailbox exists in your tenant that can be subject to a retention policy for Teams. Messages from the meeting are stored in both the users' and the shadow mailbox.

- For external users joining by using an account from another Microsoft 365 organization, your retention policies can't delete messages for this user because they are stored in that user's mailbox in another tenant.

It is also important to know what happens to the data of users, when they leave the organization:

| **Documents and Files**| **Chat messages**| **Channel messages**|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Because files and documents stored in a team are located on SharePoint Online sites, the same behavior as for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business applies.| If a user leaves the organization and the according account is deleted, the chat messages that are subject to retention are stored in an inactive mailbox. The chat messages remain subject to any retention policy that was placed on the user before their mailbox was made inactive, and the contents are available to an eDiscovery search. | Channel messages posted by a user are stored in the Azure database and the mailbox of the teams. When a user leaves the organization, those data remains unaffected.|
