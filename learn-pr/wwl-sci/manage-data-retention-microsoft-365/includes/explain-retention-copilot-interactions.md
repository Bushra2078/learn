Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is an AI-powered productivity tool that integrates large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with Microsoft 365 applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. This tool enhances user creativity, productivity, and skills by utilizing AI to understand, summarize, predict, and generate content based on data from Microsoft Graph. Given its extensive interaction with sensitive data, effective retention policies are crucial for compliance with legal and regulatory standards. They also play a key role in protecting against data breaches and loss, maintaining the integrity and security of organizational data.

## Overview of retention in Copilot for Microsoft 365

Retention policies for the location **Teams chats and Copilot interactions** manage the lifecycle of digital content from user interactions with Copilot. These policies ensure compliance with legal and regulatory standards for data retention and deletion, streamlining compliance across communication platforms. Retention in Copilot involves:

- **User prompts**: Text that users type or select in Copilot that is captured as messages.
- **Copilot responses**: These include text responses, links, and references generated by Copilot. Non-essential elements like progress indicators aren't retained.

## How retention works with Copilot for Microsoft 365

User interaction data in Copilot, including both user prompts and responses, is securely stored within an Exchange mailbox designated with the **RecipientTypeDetails** attribute of **UserMailbox**. This attribute is also used for storing message data from Teams private channels and cloud-based Teams users. Access to this data is restricted to eDiscovery tools, ensuring compliance with legal standards.

### Retention lifecycle for Copilot for Microsoft 365

In the retention process, messages are initially stored in hidden folders within the user's Exchange mailbox. After the expiration of their retention period, these messages are transferred to the SubstrateHolds folder. This temporary storage is primarily for compliance purposes, where items are retained until they're either permanently deleted following the expiration of their retention period or held due to legal or eDiscovery reasons. The SubstrateHolds folder plays a crucial role in the compliance architecture by preserving data invisibly until all retention criteria are met.

| Scenario | Modified or deleted content| Unmodified content|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Retain and delete**| If edited or deleted during the retention period, the content is immediately moved to SubstrateHolds and is permanently deleted 1-7 days after the retention period.| Moves directly to SubstrateHolds post-retention period and is permanently deleted within 1-7 days after at least 1 day of storage.|
| **Retain-only**| Edited or deleted content is moved to SubstrateHolds and retained indefinitely until the end of the retention period, followed by deletion within 1-7 days.| Remains unchanged in its original location, unaffected by retention operations.|
| **Delete-only**| Content is immediately stored in SubstrateHolds for at least 1 day, then permanently deleted within 1-7 days.| After the retention period, it's moved to SubstrateHolds, retained for at least 1 day, and then permanently deleted within 1-7 days.|

## Handling employee departures

When an employee leaves the organization, their Microsoft 365 account is deactivated. Their Copilot interactions that are under retention are securely stored in an inactive mailbox. This retention ensures that the data remains accessible for eDiscovery searches, meeting legal and regulatory requirements.
