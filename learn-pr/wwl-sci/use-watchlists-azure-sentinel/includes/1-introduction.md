Azure Sentinel provides a table to store list data accessible to Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries.  The Watchlists page in Azure Sentinel provides the management options to maintain the lists.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that has implemented Azure Sentinel.  The Security Operations team members need to prioritize alerts that are impacting high-value target servers.  

You must import a list of server names into Azure Sentinel, which can then be used by detection queries to set a priority field.  You import a list of servers into the Watchlist page of Azure Sentinel.  Once created, you instruct the Security Operations team to use the watch list in their KQL queries.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Create a watchlist in Azure Sentinel
- Use KQL to access the watchlist in Azure Sentinel
