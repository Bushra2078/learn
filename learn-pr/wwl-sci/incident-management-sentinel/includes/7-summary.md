Contoso needs to manage and mitigate security threats in its environment. As lead system engineer, you're tasked with meeting this goal.

In this module, you learned about using Microsoft Sentinel to detect and investigate issues in an environment. You practiced using rules and alerts to investigate and identify anomalies in the company's Azure Activity log.

Now, you can lead the Contoso IT team in protecting the company's security environment with Microsoft Sentinel. Ongoing activities might include creating custom analytics rules, using playbooks for automated responses, and using workbooks to provide dashboards and visualizations.
