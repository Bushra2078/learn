Once you have created sensitivity labels and configured label policies, you can start using them in your organization.  In this module, you will learn how to manage sensitivity labels. You will also learn to apply sensitivity labels to emails and files.

After sensitivity labels are implemented and your organization has been using them for some time, you should evaluate their effectiveness and perhaps fine-tune label policies.  Using Label Analytics you can identify which sensitivity labels trigger too many false positives. In this module, you will learn how to monitor sensitivity label performance using these tools.

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Apply sensitivity labels to Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites.

- Monitor label usage using label analytics.

- Configure on-premises labeling.

- Manage protection settings and marking for applied sensitivity labels.

- Apply protections and restrictions to email.

- Apply protections and restrictions to files.
