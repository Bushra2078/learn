You connect Microsoft 365 and Azure services to the Azure Sentinel workspace using the provided data connectors.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Azure Sentinel.  You need to connect Microsoft 365 and Azure services to Azure Sentinel. 

Based on your previously documented connector plan, you use the data connector page to enable the specific connectors.  As you activate the connectors, you notice the option to have incidents created from the Azure Active Directory Identity Protection service.  You donâ€™t follow the recommended option to create incidents as you plan to activate the incident creation rule with custom options later in your implementation process.  

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Connect Microsoft service connectors
- Explain how connectors auto-create incidents in Azure Sentinel
