In addition to defending your Azure environment, you can add Azure Defender capabilities to your hybrid environment to:

- Protect your non-Azure servers

- Protect your virtual machines in other clouds (such as AWS and GCP)

- Protect SQL databases

For machines, the Log Analytics agent is the only required technology.  To provide more insights for security alerts, connecting other cloud providers (AWS, GCP) resources will provide cloud security posture management information.
