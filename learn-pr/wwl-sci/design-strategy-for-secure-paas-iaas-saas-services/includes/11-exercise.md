Tailwind Traders is a modern commerce company. For more than 30 years,
the company has been a popular retail destination. It has grown to more
than 50 physical stores. Several years ago, its chief executive officer
(CEO) anticipated changes in retail and bought a competing e-commerce
startup that was growing aggressively in niche markets. Today, the
company is seen as an innovative leader with customer-focused local
storefronts.

The retail innovation team reports to the company's chief technology
officer (CTO), who was the CEO of the acquired e-commerce start-up.
Those technology solutions are the main hub for interactions with
customers. Those solutions affect 60 percent of global revenue and
produce 30 percent of annual gross sales. Examples of those innovations
include:

The new CIO is focused on improving technical operations in multiple
areas to fuel greater innovation throughout the company while limiting
disruptions to core business operations. The cloud will play an
important role in this transition. To accomplish this vision the CIO
hired a new Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The new CISO
started planning his strategy to secure PaaS, IaaS and SaaS workloads,
and as part of this strategy he established that the company needs to:

-   Implement a cloud security posture management platform that can
    offer native vulnerability assessment for VMs and Containers, and
    support threat detection for Cosmos DB

-   Implement a data classification system for their Azure workloads
    that is able to classify and label data in SQL databases and storage
    accounts

-   Implement a security baseline for SaaS workloads in Microsoft 365

-   Support security posture management and threat detection for IoT
    workloads
