    choices:
    - content: "Reports."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Reports will provide targeted information but doesn't give a snapshot of an organization's security posture."
    - content: "Secure Score."
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A snapshot of an organization's current security posture can't be found in the Policies option."
  - content: "Which of the following describes what an admin would need to select to view security cards grouped by risk, detection trends, configuration, and health, among others?"
    choices:
    - content: "Group by topic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Use this filter to view security cards grouped by risk, detection trends, configuration, and health, among others."
    - content: "Group by risk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't the filter to get the correct view."
    - content: "Group by category."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't the filter to get the correct view."
  - content: "An admin wants to get a comprehensive view of an attack including where it started, what tactics were used, and how far it has gone in the network. What can the admin use to view this type of information?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alerts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although alerts provide valuable clues about an ongoing attack, piecing them together to get a comprehensive view is challenging.  An incident is a collection of correlated alerts that make up the story of an attack."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. An incident is a collection of correlated alerts that make up the story of an attack."
