Incidents are a collection of correlated alerts. Alerts are created when suspicious event is found. Alerts are generated from different device, user, and mailbox entities, and can come from many different domains. These alerts are automatically aggregated by Microsoft 365 Defender. It is the grouping of these related alerts that form an incident. The incident provides a comprehensive view and context of an attack.

Security personnel can use an incident to determine where an attack started, what methods were used, and to what extent the attack has progressed within the network. They can also ascertain the scope of the attack, how many users, devices, and mailboxes were impacted. Severity of the attack can also be determined.

## Incident management

Managing incidents is critical in ensuring that threats are contained and addressed.  In Microsoft 365 Defender, you can manage incidents on devices, users accounts, and mailboxes.

You can manage incidents by selecting an incident from the Incidents queue.

Incidents are automatically assigned a name based on alert. You can edit the name of an incident, resolve it, set its classification and determination. You can also assign the incident to yourself, add incident tags and comments.

In cases where while investigating you would like to move alerts from one incident to another you can also do so from the Alerts tab, thus creating a larger or smaller incident that includes all relevant alerts.
