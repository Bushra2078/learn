The Microsoft Security Center includes a **Reports** section. This section shows various cards covering different areas. Security analysts and administrators can track the cards as part of their day-to-day operations. On drill-down, cards provide detailed reports and, in some cases, management options.

By default, cards are grouped by the following categories:

- **Identities** - user accounts and credentials
- **Data** - email and document contents
- **Devices** - computers, mobile phones, and other devices
- **Apps** - programs and attached online services

In the example below, the cards are grouped by category. The first category is **Identities** where you find two cards, **Users at risk** and **Global admins**. The second category is **Data** where you find two cards, **Users with the most shared files** and **Third-party DLP policy matches**.

You have the option to group cards by topic, which will rearrange the cards and group them into the following topics:

- **Risk** - cards that highlight entities, such as accounts and devices, that might be at risk. These cards also highlight possible sources of risk, such as new threat campaigns and privileged cloud apps
- **Detection trends** - cards that highlight new threat detections, anomalies, and policy violations
- **Configuration and health** - cards that cover the configuration and deployment of security controls, including device onboarding states to management services
- **Other** - all other cards not categorized under other topics

In the example below, the cards are grouped by topic. The first category is **Risk**. The second category is **Detection trends**.
