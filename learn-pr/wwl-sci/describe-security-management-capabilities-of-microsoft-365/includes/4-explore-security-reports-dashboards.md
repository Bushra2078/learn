#### Security report
The general **security report** enables admins to view information about security trends and track the protection status of your identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure.

By default, cards are grouped by the following categories:

- **Identities** - user accounts and credentials.
- **Data** - email and document contents.
- **Devices** - computers, mobile phones, and other devices.
- **Apps** - programs and attached online services.

In the example below, the cards are grouped by category (only two of the four categories are shown in the image).

You can also group cards by topic, which will rearrange the cards and group them into the following areas:

- **Risk** - cards that highlight entities, such as accounts and devices, that might be at risk. These cards also highlight possible sources of risk, such as new threat campaigns and privileged cloud apps.
- **Detection trends** - cards that highlight new threat detections, anomalies, and policy violations.
- **Configuration and health** - cards that cover the configuration and deployment of security controls, including device onboarding states to management services.
- **Other** - all cards not categorized under other topics.

#### Endpoint reports
The reports section also includes Microsoft Defender for Endpoint reports, including a **threat protection report**, a **device health and compliance report**, and a **vulnerable devices report**.

- The **threat protection report** provides high-level information about alerts generated in your organization. The report includes trending information showing the detection sources, categories, severities, statuses, classifications, and determinations of alerts across time.
    


    The report's dashboard is structured into two sections:
    - Alert trends - By default, the alert trends display alert information from the 30-day period ending in the latest full day. To gain better perspective on trends occurring in your organization, you can fine-tune the reporting period by selecting a time range (30 days, 3 months, 6 months, or custom)
    - Alert summary - The alert summary shows alert information scoped to the current day.

    This report's dashboard is also structured into two sections: 
    - Device trends - By default, the device trends displays device information from the 30-day period ending in the latest full day. To gain better perspective on trends occurring in your organization, you can fine-tune the reporting period by adjusting the time period. 
    - Device summary - The device summary shows device information scoped to the current day.
