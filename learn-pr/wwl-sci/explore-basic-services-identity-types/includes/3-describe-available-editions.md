Azure AD is available in four editions: Free, Office 365 Apps, Premium P1, and Premium P2.

**Azure Active Directory Free**. The free version allows you to administer users and create groups, synchronize with on-premises Active Directory, create basic reports, configure self-service password change for cloud users, and enable single sign-on across Azure, Microsoft 365, and many popular SaaS apps. The free version also has an upper limit of 5000 objects that can be held in Azure AD. The free edition is included with subscriptions to Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, Intune, and Power Platform.

**Office 365 Apps**.  The Office 365 Apps edition allows you to do everything included in the free version, plus self-service password reset for cloud users, and device write-back, which offers two-way synchronization between on-premises directories and Azure AD. The Office 365 Apps edition of Azure Active Directory is included in subscriptions to Office 365 E1, E3, E5, F1, and F3.

**Azure Active Directory Premium P1**. The Premium P1 edition includes all the features in the free and Office 365 apps editions. It also supports advanced administration, such as dynamic groups, self-service group management, Microsoft Identity Manager (an on-premises identity and access management suite) and cloud write-back capabilities, which allow self-service password reset for your on-premises users.

**Azure Active Directory Premium P2**. P2 offers all the Premium P1 features, and [Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection) to help provide risk-based Conditional Access to your apps and critical company data. P2 also gives you [Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started) to help discover, restrict, and monitor administrators and their access to resources, and to provide just-in-time access when needed.

Azure Active Directory Premium P1 and Premium P2 aren't currently supported in China.

There's also an option for "**Pay as you go**" **feature licenses**.  You can get other feature licenses separately, such as Azure Active Directory Business-to-Customer (B2C). B2C can help you provide identity and access management solutions for your customer-facing apps. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory B2C documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/).
