Organizations may use the hybrid identity model, or the cloud only identity model. In the hybrid model, identities are created in Windows Active Directory or another identity provider, and then synchronized to Azure AD. In the cloud-only model, identities are created and wholly managed in Azure AD. Whether identities are created on-premises or in the cloud, users can access both cloud and on-premises resources.

With the hybrid model, with hybrid model, users accessing both on-premise and cloud apps are hybrid users managed in the on-premise Active Directory.  When you make an update in your on-premises AD DS, all updates to user accounts, groups, and contacts are synchronized to your Azure AD. The synchronization is managed with *Azure AD Connect*.

When using the hybrid model, authentication can either be done by Azure AD, which is known as *managed authentication*. Or Azure AD redirects the client requesting authentication to another identity provider, which is known as *federated authentication*.

One of three authentication methods can be used:

* **Password hash synchronization**. This is the simplest way to enable authentication for on-premises directory objects in Azure AD. Users can use the same username and password that they use on-premises without any additional infrastructure being needed.
* **Pass-through authentication (PTA)**. Provides a simple password validation for Azure AD authentication services by using a software agent that runs on one or more on-premises servers.  The servers validate the users directly with an on-premises Active Directory, which ensures that the password validation doesn't happen in the cloud.
* **Federated authentication**. Azure AD hands off the authentication process to a separate trusted authentication system, such as on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), to validate the userâ€™s password.
