When it comes to security, your organization can no longer rely on its network boundary. To allow employees, partners, and customers to collaborate securely, identity has become the new security perimeter. Using an identity provider gives your organization the ability to manage all aspects of identity security. 

This module introduces you to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based identity and access management service. In this module, you'll learn about the benefits of using a cloud-based identity provider, including single sign-on for users. You'll also find out about the different Azure AD editions, the identity types supported by Azure AD, and how you can use it to support external users.
