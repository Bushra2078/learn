When it comes to security, your organization can no longer rely on your organization’s network boundary. To allow employees, partners, and customers to collaborate securely, identity has become the new security perimeter. Using an identity provider gives your organization the ability to manage all aspects of identity security. 

This module introduces you to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service. In this module you will learn about the benefits of using a cloud-based identity provider, including single sign-on for users. You will also learn about the different Azure Active Directory editions, the identity types supported by Azure Active Directory, and how you can use Azure Active Directory to support external users.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe what Azure Active Directory does.
- Describe the identity types that Azure Active Directory supports.
