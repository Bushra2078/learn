When it comes to security, your organization can no longer rely on its network boundary. To allow employees, partners, and customers to collaborate securely, organizations need to shift to an approach whereby identity becomes the new security perimeter. Using an identity provider helps organizations manage that shift and all the aspects of identity security.

This module introduces you to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based identity and access management service. In this module, you'll learn about the benefits of using a cloud-based identity provider, including single sign-on for users. You'll also find out about the different Azure AD editions, the identity types supported by Azure AD, and how you can use it to support external users.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe what Azure AD does.
- Describe the identity types that Azure AD supports.
