  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An organization is launching a new app for its customers.  Customers will use a sign-in screen that is customized with the organization's brand identity. Which type of Azure External identity solution should the organization use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure AD B2B"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. B2B collaboration allows you to share your organizationâ€™s applications and services with guests from other organizations."
    - content: "Azure AD B2C"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AD B2C is an authentication solution for customers that you can customize with your brand identity."
    - content: "Azure AD Hybrid identities"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AD hybrid identities synchronize identities between on premises Active Directory, and Azure Active Directory."
  - content: "An organization has completed a full migration to the cloud and has purchased devices for all its employees. All employees sign in to the device through an organizational account configured in Azure AD.  Select the option that best describes how these devices are set up in Azure AD."
    choices:
    - content: "These devices are set up as Azure AD registered."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This customer scenario explicitly states that all employees sign in to the device through an organization account and because devices are purchased by the organization, there's no requirement for bring your own device (BYOD). The goal of Azure AD registered devices is to provide users with support for BYOD or mobile device scenarios. Azure AD registered devices register to Azure AD without requiring an organizational account to sign in to the device."
    - content: "These devices are set up as Azure AD joined."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An Azure AD joined device is a device joined to Azure AD through an organizational account, which is then used to sign in to the device. Azure AD joined devices are generally owned by the organization."
    - content: "These devices are set up as Hybrid Azure AD joined."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This customer scenario has completed a full migration to the cloud and therefore has no on-premises Active Directory. There is no requirement for devices to be hybrid Azure AD joined."
  - content: "A developer wants an application to connect to Azure resources that support Azure AD authentication, without having to manage any credentials and without incurring any extra cost.  Which option best describes the identity type of the application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Service principal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Service principals are used by applications or services to access Azure resources but application developers must manage and protect the credentials."
    - content: "Managed identity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Managed identities are a type of service principal that are automatically managed in Azure AD and eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials."
    - content: "Hybrid identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A hybrid identity refers to a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location."
