As Azure Sentinel collects logs and alerts from all of its connected data sources, it builds baseline behavioral profiles of your organization’s entities, including users, hosts, IP addresses, and domains.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Azure Sentinel.  The threat hunting team has raised concerns about a specific user account based on discovered threat indicators and needs to see a profile containing historical and related entity data quickly.

As Azure Sentinel collects logs and alerts from all of its connected data sources, it analyzes them. It builds baseline behavioral profiles of your organization’s entities (users, hosts, IP addresses, applications, etc.).  You have the threat hunting team member navigate to the Entity behavior page to perform further analysis on the account.
