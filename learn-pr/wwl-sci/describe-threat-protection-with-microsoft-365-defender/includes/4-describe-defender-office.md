Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is available in two plans. The plan you choose influences the tools you’ll see and use. It's important to make sure you select the best plan to meet your organization's needs.

## Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1

This plan offers configuration, protection, and detection tools for your Office 365 suite:

- **Safe Attachments**: Checks email attachments for malicious content.
- **Safe Links**: Links are scanned for each click. A safe link remains accessible, but malicious links are blocked.
- **ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams**: Protects your organization when users collaborate and share files by identifying and blocking malicious files in team sites and document libraries.
- **ATP anti-phishing protection**: Detects attempts to impersonate your users and internal or custom domains.
- **Real-time detections**: A real-time report that allows you to identify and analyze recent threats.

## Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2

This plan includes all the core features of Plan 1, and provides automation, investigation, remediation, and simulation tools to help protect your Office 365 suite:

- **Threat Trackers**: Provide the latest intelligence on prevailing cybersecurity issues, and allow an organization to take countermeasures before there's an actual threat.
- **Threat Explorer**: A real-time report that allows you to identify and analyze recent threats.
- **Automated investigation and response (AIR)**:  Includes a set of security playbooks that can be launched automatically, such as when an alert is triggered, or manually. A security playbook can start an automated investigation, provide detailed results, and recommend actions that the security team can approve or reject.
- **Attack Simulator**: Allows you to run realistic attack scenarios in your organization to identify vulnerabilities.
