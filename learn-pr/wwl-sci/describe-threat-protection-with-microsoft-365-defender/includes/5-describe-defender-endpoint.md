Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MSDE), formerly Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, is a platform designed to help enterprise networks protect endpoints. It does so by preventing, detecting, investigating, and responding to advanced threats. MSDE embeds technology built into Windows 10 and MSFT cloud services.

This technology includes endpoint behavioral sensors that collect and process signals from the operating system, cloud security analytics that turn signals into insights, detections and recommendations, and threat intelligence to identify attacker tools, techniques, generate alerts.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint includes:

- **Threat and vulnerability management**: A risk-based approach to the discovery, prioritization, and remediation of endpoint vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It uses sensors on devices to avoid the need for agents or scans, and prioritizes vulnerabilities.
- **Attack surface reduction**: Reduces the places where your organization is vulnerable to cyberthreats and attacks by ensuring only *allowed* apps can run, and preventing apps from accessing dangerous locations.
- **Next generation protection**: Brings together machine learning, big data analysis, in-depth threat resistance research, and the Microsoft cloud infrastructure to protect devices in your enterprise organization.
- **Endpoint detection and response**: Provides advanced attack detections that are near real time and actionable. Security analysts can prioritize alerts, see the full scope of a breach, and respond to remediate threats.
- **Automated investigation and remediation**: The automated investigation feature uses inspection algorithms and processes used by analysts (such as playbooks) to examine alerts and take quick remediation action to resolve breaches. This process significantly reduces the volume of alerts that must be investigated individually.
- **Microsoft Threat Experts**: A managed threat hunting service that provides Security Operation Centers (SOCs) with monitoring and analysis tools to ensure critical threats donâ€™t get missed.
- **Management and APIs**: Provides APIs to integrate with other solutions.

MSDE includes Microsoft Secure Score for Devices to help you dynamically assess the security state of your enterprise network, identify unprotected systems, and take recommended actions to improve overall security. MSDE integrates with various components in the Microsoft Defender suite, and with other Microsoft solutions including Intune and Azure Security Center.

Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to protect your organization's endpoints and respond to advanced threats.
