Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MSDE), formerly Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, is a platform designed to help enterprise networks protect endpoints by preventing, detecting, investigating, and responding to advanced threats. MSDE embeds technology built into windows 10 and MSFT cloud services, including endpoint behavioral sensors that collect and process signals from the operating system, cloud security analytics that turn signals into insights, detections and recommendations, and threat intelligence to identify attacker tools, techniques, generate alerts, and more.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MSDE) includes:

- **Threat & vulnerability management**: is a risk-based approach to the discovery, prioritization, and remediation of endpoint vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It uses sensors on devices to avoid the need for agents or scans and prioritizes vulnerabilities.
- **Attack surface reduction**: reduce the places where your organization is vulnerable to cyberthreats and attacks by ensuring only *allowed* apps can run and prevent apps from accessing dangerous locations.
- **Next Generation protection**: brings together machine learning, big-data analysis, in-depth threat resistance research, and the Microsoft cloud infrastructure to protect devices in your enterprise organization.
- **Endpoint detection and response**: provide advanced attack detections that are near real-time and actionable. Security analysts can prioritize alerts, gain visibility into the full scope of a breach, and take response actions to remediate threats.
- **Automated investigation & remediation**: The automated investigation feature uses various inspection algorithms and processes used by analysts (such as playbooks) to examine alerts and take immediate remediation action to resolve breaches. This significantly reduces the volume of alerts that must be investigated individually.
- **Microsoft Threat Experts**: is a managed threat hunting service that provides Security Operation Centers (SOCs) with monitoring and analysis tools to ensure critical threats donâ€™t get missed.
- **Management & APIs**: provide APIs to integrate with other solutions.

Defender for Endpoint includes Microsoft Secure Score for Devices to help you dynamically assess the security state of your enterprise network, identify unprotected systems, and take recommended actions to improve the overall security of your organization. It integrating with various components in the Microsoft Defender suite, MSDE also integrates with other Microsoft solutions including Intune and Azure security center.

Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to protect your organizations endpoints and respond to advanced threats.
