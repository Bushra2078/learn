The Microsoft 365 Defender portal home page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data depends on the user role. Because the Microsoft 365 Defender portal uses role-based access control, different roles see cards that are more meaningful to their day-to-day jobs.

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal allows admins to tailor the navigation pane to meet daily operational needs. Admins can customize the navigation pane to show or hide functions and services based on their specific preferences. Customization is specific to the individual admin, so other admins wonâ€™t see these changes.

> You must be assigned an appropriate role, such as Global Administrator, Security Administrator, Security Operator, or Security Reader in Microsoft Entra ID to access the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

Listed below we describe a few of the other capabilities accessible from the left navigation bar in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.

### Incidents and alerts
Microsoft 365 services and apps create alerts when they detect a suspicious or malicious event or activity. Individual alerts provide valuable clues about a completed or ongoing attack. These alerts are automatically aggregated by Microsoft 365 Defender. It's the grouping of these related alerts that form an incident. An incident in Microsoft 365 Defender is a collection of correlated alerts and associated data that make up the story of an attack. Selecting an incident name displays a summary of the incident and provides access to tabs with additional information, including:

- The full story of the attack, including all the alerts, assets, and remediation actions taken.
- All the alerts related to the incident.
- All the assets (devices, users, mailboxes, and apps) that have been identified to be part of or related to the incident.
- All the automated investigations triggered by the alerts in the incident.
- All the supported evidence and response.

### Hunting

You can build custom detection rules and hunt for specific threats in your environment.
