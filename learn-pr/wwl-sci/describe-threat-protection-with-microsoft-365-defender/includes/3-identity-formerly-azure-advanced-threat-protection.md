Microsoft Defender for Identity, formerly Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP), is a cloud-based security solution that uses your on-premises Active Directory data (called signals) to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization. Microsoft Defender for Identity covers these key areas:

- Monitor and profile user behavior and activities.
- Protect user identities and reduce the attack surface.
- Identify suspicious activities and advanced attacks across the cyber-attack kill-chain.

## Monitor and profile user behavior and activities

Defender for Identity monitors and analyzes user activities and information across your network, such as permissions and group membership, creating a behavioral baseline for each user. Defender for Identity then identifies anomalies with adaptive built-in intelligence, giving you insights into suspicious activities and events, revealing the advanced threats, compromised users, and insider threats facing your organization.

## Protect user identities and reduce the attack surface

Defender for Identity provides you invaluable insights on identity configurations and suggested security best-practices. Through security reports and user profile analytics, Defender for Identity helps reduce your organizational attack surface, making it harder to compromise user credentials and advance an attack. Defender for Identity security reports  helps identify users and devices that authenticate using clear-text passwords, and provides additional insights to improve your organizational security posture and policies.

## Identify suspicious activities and advanced attacks across the cyber-attack kill-chain

Typically, attacks are launched against any accessible entity, such as a low-privileged user, and then quickly move laterally until the attacker gains access to valuable assets â€“ such as sensitive accounts, domain administrators, and highly sensitive data. Defender for Identity identifies these advanced threats at the source throughout the entire cyber-attack kill chain:

- Reconnaissance
- Compromised credentials
- Lateral movements
- Domain dominance

## Investigate alerts and user activities

Defender for Identity is designed to reduce general alert noise, providing only relevant, important security alerts in a simple, real-time organizational attack timeline. The Defender for Identity attack timeline view allows you to easily stay focused on what matters, using the intelligence of smart analytics. Use Defender for Identity to quickly investigate threats, and gain insights across the organization for users, devices, and network resources.

Use Microsoft Defender for Identity to protect your organization from compromised identities, advanced threats, and malicious insider actions.
