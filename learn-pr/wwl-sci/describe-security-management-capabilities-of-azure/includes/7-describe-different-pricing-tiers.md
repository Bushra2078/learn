Cloud security posture management is essential for every organization. Microsoft Azure lets you decide how much you need to meet your regulatory, compliance, and corporate security needs.

Defender for Cloud is offered in two modes:

- Without enhanced security features (Free) - Defender for Cloud is enabled for free on all your Azure subscriptions when you visit the Microsoft Defender for Cloud dashboard in the Azure portal for the first time, or if enabled programmatically via API. Using this free mode provides the secure score and its related features: security policy, continuous security assessment, and actionable security recommendations to help you protect your Azure resources.

- Defender for Cloud with all enhanced security features - Enabling enhanced security extends the capabilities of the free mode to workloads running in private and other public clouds, providing unified security management and threat protection across your hybrid cloud workloads.
