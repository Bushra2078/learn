Cloud security posture management is essential for every organization. Microsoft Azure lets you decide how much you need to meet your regulatory, compliance, and corporate security needs.

Security Center is offered in two modes:

#### Azure Defender off

Security Center without Azure Defender is enabled for free on all your Azure subscriptions when you visit the Azure Security Center dashboard in the Azure portal for the first time or if enabled programmatically via API.

#### Azure Defender on

Enabling Azure Defender extends the free mode capabilities to workloads running in private and other public clouds, providing unified security management and threat protection across your hybrid cloud workloads.
