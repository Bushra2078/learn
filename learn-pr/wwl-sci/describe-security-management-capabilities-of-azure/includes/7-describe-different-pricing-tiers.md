Cloud security posture management is essential for every organization. Microsoft Azure lets you decide how much you need to meet your regulatory, compliance, and corporate security needs.

Defender for Cloud is offered in two modes:

#### Microsoft Defender for Cloud off

Defender for Cloud without Microsoft Defender for Cloud is enabled free of charge on all your Azure subscriptions when you visit the workload protection dashboard in the Azure portal for the first time, or if enabled programmatically via API.

#### Microsoft Defender for Cloud on

Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud extends the free mode capabilities to workloads running in private and other public clouds, providing unified security management and threat protection across your hybrid cloud workloads.
