Defender for Cloud is a tool for security posture management and threat protection. It strengthens the security posture of your cloud resources, and with its integrated Microsoft Defender plans, Defender for Cloud protects workloads running in Azure, hybrid, and other cloud platforms.

Defender for Cloud fills three vital needs as you manage the security of your resources and workloads in the cloud and on-premises:

- **Continuously assess** - Know your security posture, identify and track vulnerabilities.
- **Secure** - Harden all connected resources and services. 
- **Defend** - Detect and resolve threats to resources, workloads, and services.

The features of Microsoft Defender for Cloud, that deliver on these requirements, cover two broad pillars of cloud security: cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection.

### Cloud security posture management (CSPM)

In Defender for Cloud, the posture management features provide:

- Visibility - to help you understand your current security situation
- Hardening guidance - to help you efficiently and effectively improve your security

#### Secure score and hardening recommendations

The central feature in Defender for Cloud that enables you to achieve those goals is secure score. Defender for Cloud continually assesses your resources, subscriptions, and organization for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud also provides hardening recommendations based on any identified security misconfigurations and weaknesses. Use these security recommendations to strengthen the security posture of your organization's Azure, hybrid, and multi-cloud resources.

Additional information on secure score is covered in the subsequent topic.

#### Network map

One of the most powerful Security Center tools for continuously monitoring the security status of your network is the network map. Use the map to look at the topology of your workloads, so you can see if each node is properly configured. You'll see how your nodes are connected, which helps you block unwanted connections that could potentially make it easier for an attacker to creep along your network.

### Cloud workload protection (CWP)

Through cloud workload protection capabilities, Microsoft Defender for Cloud is able to detect and resolve threats to resources, workloads, and services.

#### Defender plans

Microsoft Defender for Cloud includes a range of advanced, intelligent, protections for your workloads. The workload protections are provided through Microsoft Defender plans specific to the types of resources in your subscriptions. The Defender for Cloud plans you can select from are:

- **Microsoft Defender for servers** adds threat detection and advanced defenses for your Windows and Linux machines.
- **Microsoft Defender for App Service** identifies attacks targeting applications running over App Service.
- **Microsoft Defender for Storage** detects potentially harmful activity on your Azure Storage accounts. 
- **Microsoft Defender for SQL** secures your databases and their data wherever they're located.
- **Microsoft Defender for Kubernetes** provides cloud-native Kubernetes security environment hardening, workload protection, and run-time protection.
- **Microsoft Defender for container registries** protects all the Azure Resource Manager based registries in your subscription.
- **Microsoft Defender for Key Vault** is advanced threat protection for Azure Key Vault.
- **Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager**  automatically monitors the resource management operations in your organization.
- **Microsoft Defender for DNS** provides an additional layer of protection for resources that use Azure DNS's Azure-provided name resolution capability.
- **Microsoft Defender for open-source relational protections**  brings threat protections for open-source relational databases.

These different plans can be enabled separately and will run simultaneously to provide a comprehensive defense for compute, data, and service layers in your environment.

Through the Microsoft Defender plans specific to the types of resources in your subscriptions, organizations can take advantage of enhanced security features.
