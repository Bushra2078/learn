Cloud-based systems are continually evolving and changing as companies move away from on-premises to the cloud, making it difficult for any IT department to know if your data, assets, and resources are as fully protected as they used to be. Even a small misconfiguration of a new feature can increase the attack surface available for cybercriminals to exploit.

Cloud security posture management (CSPM) is a relatively new class of tools designed to improve your cloud security management by assessing your systems and automatically alerting the security staff in your IT department when a vulnerability is found. CSPM takes advantage of tools and services in your cloud environment to monitor and prioritize your security enhancements and features.

It uses a combination of tools and services to achieve this:

- **Zero trust-based access control**: That considers active threat level during access control decisions.
- **Real-time risk scoring**: To provide visibility into top risks.
- **Threat and vulnerability management (TVM)** establishes a holistic view of the organization's attack surface and risk. It integrates it into operations and engineering decision making.
- **Discover sharing risks**: To understand the data exposure of enterprise intellectual property on sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud services.
- **Technical policy**: Apply guardrails to audit and enforce the organization's standards and policies to technical systems. See Azure Policy and Azure Blueprints.
- **Threat modeling systems and architectures**, and specific applications.

The main objective for a cloud security team working on posture management is to continuously report on and improve the organization's security posture by focusing on disrupting a potential attacker's return on investment (ROI).

The function of cloud security posture management in your organization may be spread across multiple teams, or there may be a dedicated team. CSPM can be of use to numerous teams in your organization:

- Threat intelligence team
- Information technology
- Compliance and risk management teams
- Business leaders and SMEs
- Security architecture and operations
- Audit team

Use Cloud security posture management to improve your cloud security management by assessing your environment, and automatically alerting the security staff for vulnerabilities.
