Microsoft's cybersecurity group and the Center for Internet Security (CIS), have developed best practices to help establish security baselines for the Azure platform. A baseline is the implementation of the benchmark on the individual Azure service.

CIS benchmarks have been used with Azure security services and tools to make security and compliance easier for customer applications running on Azure services. Every service comes with a baseline that's already designed to help provide security for most common-use cases. These baselines also provide a consistent experience when securing your environment.

### The Azure Security Benchmark

A benchmark contains security recommendations for a specific technology, such as Azure. The recommendations are categorized by the control to which they belong. The Azure Security Benchmark (ASB) provides prescriptive best practices and recommendations to help improve the security of workloads, data, and services on Azure.  Some of the controls used in the ASB include network security, identity and access control, data protection, data recovery, incident response, and more.

Security baselines for Azure focus on cloud-centric control areas and apply guidance from the Azure Security Benchmark.

Each Azure security baseline includes the following information:

- **Azure ID**: The Azure Security Benchmark ID that corresponds to the recommendation.
- **Recommendation**: The recommendation provides a high-level description of the control.
- **Guidance**: The rationale for the recommendation and links to guidance on how to implement it.
- **Responsibility**: Who is responsible for implementing the control? Possible scenarios are customer responsibility, Microsoft responsibility, or shared responsibility.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud monitoring**: Does Microsoft Defender for Cloud monitor the control?

Security baselines are included for many Azure services.   As an example, refer to the [Azure security baseline for Defender for Cloud](/azure/security-center/security-baseline).  The content is grouped by the security controls defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Refer to [Azure Security Benchmark documentation](/azure/security/benchmarks/) for a complete listing of the available baselines.
