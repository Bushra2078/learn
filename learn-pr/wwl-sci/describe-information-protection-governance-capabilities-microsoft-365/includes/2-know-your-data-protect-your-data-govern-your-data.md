Microsoft Purview Information Protection discovers, classifies, and protects sensitive and business-critical content throughout its lifecycle across your organization.  It provides the tools to know your data, protect your data, and prevent data loss.

Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management manages your content lifecycle using solutions to import, store, and classify business-critical data so you can keep what you need and delete what you don't. It gives organizations the capabilities to govern their data, for compliance or regulatory requirements.

Information protection and data lifecycle management work together to classify, protect, and govern your data where it lives, and wherever it goes.

- **Know your data**: Organizations can understand their data landscape and identify important data across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.  Capabilities and tools such as trainable classifiers, activity explorer, and content explorer allow organizations to know their data.
- **Protect your data**: Organizations can apply flexible protection actions including encryption, access restrictions, and visual markings.
- **Prevent data loss**: Organizations can detect risky behavior and prevent accidental oversharing of sensitive information. Capabilities such as data loss prevention policies and endpoint data loss prevention enable organizations to avoid data loss.
- **Govern your data**:  Organizations can automatically keep, delete, and store data and records in a compliant manner. Data lifecycle management capabilities, like retention policies, retention labels, and records management enable organizations to govern their data.
