In order to create accessible experiences, it is important to first understand the ways in which gaming inherently requires specific player abilities. For example, players must typically need to see on-screen visuals, hear audio output, use input devices like controllers or a mouse and keyboard with speed and coordination, and problem-solve through situations of varying complexity to achieve success. By first identifying the abilities players must possess to achieve success in your game, you will be able to more readily identify inaccessible elements for players who do not possess those abilities. In this unit you will learn about the primary visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive demands posed by typical gaming experiences.

While vision, hearing, mobility, and cognitive elements will be addressed in this module, it is important to note that there are additional player considerations that are relevant to gaming experiences such as speech and communication, sensory, mental health, and more. Additional information about these player abilities can be found at [aka.ms/GDPlayerExperienceGuide](https://aka.ms/GDPlayerExperienceGuide).

## Vision and Gaming

Gaming experiences are often heavily reliant on visual elements. Vision and gaming encompass a player&#39;s ability to see on-screen elements that ultimately inform how they play the game. For example, a player sees enemies approaching from the top left corner of their screen. Based on this visual information, they make the following decisions:

- They check their current health meter status. They see their health bar is half-full.
- They check the amount of ammunition they have. Their ammunition count is zero.
- Based on these three visual elements (incoming enemies, their health bar status, and their ammunition count), they decide to flee in the opposite direction of the incoming enemies because they know they will not be successful in battle with low health and zero ammunition.

Ultimately, the visual information this player perceived on-screen prompted a set of actions and decisions that affected the outcome of their success in gameplay. The player saw the enemies approaching, viewed their current health and ammunition levels, and made a decision based on those three visual aspects of play. Players with no vision, low vision, colorblindness or other permanent or temporary disabilities that impact the ability to see on-screen elements may have been blocked from progressing in this situation because they were unaware of the incoming danger.

Other common visual elements in games include the visibility of text in menus, in-game environments, quest or objective logs, and player-to-player communication channels that are text-based. Similarly, visual objects like targeting icons, collectible objects, and other environmental cues may go unnoticed if they are presented in a way that is only visible to players with a certain degree of visual clarity.

## Hearing and Gaming

Similar to visual elements, gaming experiences also include many audio-based elements that portray important information to players needed to navigate that experience.

Think about the importance of audio cues in the following scenario. A player is exploring a wooded area in the game. While the visual game environment remains the same, suddenly the game’s music becomes very slow and ominous. The sound of footsteps rattle in the distance. Based on these audio cues, the player assumes pending danger. They follow the same steps outlined previously of checking their health and ammunition before deciding to approach the direction of the footsteps or flee in the opposite direction. For players with hearing disabilities, such as an inability to hear audio cues at all, or players who are hard of hearing, this important information being portrayed by the game through audio alone can go unnoticed.  

There are many common audio elements in games that heavily influence the outcomes of gameplay. This includes background music, key sound effects, character dialogue, as well as player-to-player communications that are voice-based. The examples below display some common game elements that are audio based.

## Cognition and Gaming

Once players receive the visual and auditory information provided by the game, they must then decide how they would like to proceed based on this information. This process can require problem-solving, decision-making, and other cognitive processes performed by the player.

Consider the following scenario. A non-player character in the game provides the player the following task: “I will give you a golden shovel if you bring me back 3 gold ores from the mines.” With this information alone, the player must understand what the instructions given mean, decide if the golden shovel is needed or wanted to progress in gameplay, and ultimately problem-solve through the process of locating and travelling to the mines, determining the tools or actions needed to mine gold ores, recall the proper amount needed for this quest, then travel back to the location of the character who offered the golden shovel. These cognitive tasks can be challenging for players with learning, memory, or other cognitive-related disabilities.

There are many common gaming experiences in which cognitive processes like attention, memory, learning new information, problem-solving, and decision making by the player heavily influence the outcomes of gameplay. This includes game elements like interpreting tutorial instructions, completing objective tasks, remember key locations, solving puzzle-based challenges, and more.

## Mobility and Gaming

After cognitive decisions are made on how to proceed in the game, players must act upon those decisions, typically through physical input. This often requires the ability to use standard input devices such as controllers, keyboards, and mice to navigate game menus, control character actions, and other necessary aspects of the game.

Gaming hardware generally consists of many small buttons or joysticks. For example, the standard Xbox controller shown in the image below consists of 20 inputs. These 20 inputs must be leveraged through movements of the player’s two thumbs and index fingers. These movements require dexterity, fine motor skills, precise coordination, speed, and endurance in the small muscles in the hands and fingers. Players with mobility-related disabilities who cannot make these fast, repetitive movements with their fingers may be blocked from progressing through game levels or mechanics that require these abilities.

There are many common mobility-based input elements in games that heavily influence the outcomes of gameplay. This includes using analog inputs such as joysticks, triggers, or mice, holding a button for a prolonged period, pressing multiple buttons simultaneously, and more. The video below displays some common game elements that are input based.
