In this module, you learned:

- How values are passed around via moves, borrows, and immutable borrows.
- How the borrow checker prevents Rust code from having data races and dangling pointers.
- What lifetimes are and how they tell the compiler about the duration of a program's values.

In the next module in this learning path, you'll discover how Rust deals with polymorphism by using generic types and traits.
