In this module, you learned about the types of applications you can build by using the Rust programming language. Rust is useful for both low-level and high-level types of development. 

You reviewed the Rust commands to work with your code. The `rustup` command is used to set up a development environment in Rust. The `rustc` command is used to write and compile Rust programs. 

You discovered the Rust Cargo feature and learned about the module system for code organization. You use Cargo to start a new project template, and build and run it.

You looked at the Rust playground environment and learned how to write, build, test, and run code in the IDE.

In the next module in this learning path, you'll set up your Rust development environment.
