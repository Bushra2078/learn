In this module, you learned about the types of applications you can build by using the Rust programming language. Rust is useful for both low-level and high-level types of development. 

You reviewed the Rust commands to work with your code. The `rustc` command is used to write and compile Rust programs. 

You discovered the Rust Cargo feature and learned about the module system for code organization. You use Cargo to create a new project, and build and run it.

You looked at the Rust playground environment and learned how to write, build, test, and run code.

## Try recipes in the Rust cookbook

The Rust Cookbook contains *recipes* for code that follows recommended practices for common programming tasks. By following the recipes, you can learn how to work with commonly used crates in Rust. The recipes cover a wide-range of topics, including processing text and numbers, working with databases, applying common algorithms, and debugging programs. You can read the Rust Cookbook on the [Rust website](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/?azure-portal=true).
