As you've seen, error handling and logging in Go aren't the same as those processes in other programming languages. First, Go's approach to error handling is straightforward. You use an `if` condition, and the function that you're calling should return multiple values. Conventionally, the last returned value is the error. If the error variable comes back `nil`, there's no error. If the value isn't `nil`, there's a failure. You can propagate the error up to the stack by just returning the error again, and you can include more context if you need to.

You can create error variables that you can reuse as return values for common error messages in your programs. 

You also need to know when to panic. We already covered how `panic` and `recover` work. These functions should be used only when you explicitly need your program to stop. There might be times when your program will stop responding even if you're handling errors properly. But that should be the exception, not the rule.

Finally, we explored how logging works in Go, and you saw how to use the standard library. Besides printing logs to the console, you can send logs to a file for processing later and then send them to a centralized location. When your codebase grows, you might need to do other things, like setting log levels or configuring different outputs. These tasks aren't supported in the standard library. You'll need to use a logging framework like zerolog.

This module is short, but be sure you understood the concepts well. They'll be helpful when you need to troubleshoot problems in your programs.
