    - content: "Using a try/catch block."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Go doesn't support the try/catch block."
    - content: "Using an `if` condition for a function that returns multiple values, in which case the last value would be the error."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The simplest way in Go for handling an error is by using an `if` condition."
    - content: "Using an `if` condition and checking if the response is `nil`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should check if the error value is `nil`, which is usually the last return value."
    - content: "Simply letting the program terminate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should always check for errors."
  - content: "What's the function that you could use to create an error variable?"
    choices:
    - content: "errors.New('Employee not found!')"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You should create an error variable if you're planning to reuse the error message."
    - content: "fmt.Errorf('Employee not found!')"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The proper way to create an error variable is with errors.New('error message')."
    - content: "error.New('Employee not found!')"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The proper way to create an error variable is with errors.New('error message')."
    - content: "log.Error('Employee not found!'')"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The proper way to create an error variable is with errors.New('error message')."  
  - content: "Which are the functions from the log package?"
    choices:
    - content: "log.Print, log.Error, log.Info"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, log.Error and log.Info don't exist."
    - content: "log.Fatal, log.Print, log.Panic"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These are functions that exist in the log package."
    - content: "log.Info, log.Warn, log.Fatal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, log.Info and log.Warn don't exist."
    - content: "log.Printf, log.Warning, log.Error"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, log.Warning and log.Error don't exist."
  - content: "What's the function that you could use to configure logging to a file?"
    choices:
    - content: "log.SetOutputFile(file)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The function to configure the output file is log.SetOutput(file)."
    - content: "log.SetFilePath(file)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The function to configure the output file is log.SetOutput(file)."
    - content: "log.SetPath(file)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The function to configure the output file is log.SetOutput(file)."
    - content: "log.SetOutput(file)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The function to configure the output file is log.SetOutput(file)."
  - content: "Why would you want to use a logging framework?"
    choices:
    - content: "To configure logging levels, multiple outputs, and global contexts."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The standard log package doesn't offer this type of functionality, which you might need as your codebase grows."
    - content: "To make your programs run slower."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this might be true to some extent, it isn't accurate."
    - content: "To simply configure structured logging."
      isCorrect: false
