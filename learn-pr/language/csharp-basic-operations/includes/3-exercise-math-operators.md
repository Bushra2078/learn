Now that we understand the basics of addition and more importantly, implicit type conversion between numeric and string data types, let's look at several other common mathematical operations on numeric data.

## Perform Basic Math Operations

### Step 1 - Write code to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ints.

Type the following code into the code editor:

```csharp-interactive
int sum = 7 + 5;
int difference = 7 - 5;
int product = 7 * 5;
int quotient = 7 / 5;

Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
Console.WriteLine("Difference: " + difference);
Console.WriteLine("Product: " + product);
Console.WriteLine("Quotient: " + quotient);
```

Run the code.  You should see the following output:

```output
Sum: 12
Difference: 2
Product: 35
Quotient: 1
```

As you can see:
- `+` is the addition operator
- `-` is the subtraction operator
- `*` is the multiplication operator
- `/` is the division operator

However, the resulting quotient of our division example may not be what you may have expected.  The values after the decimal are truncated from `quotient` since it is defined as an `int`, and `int` cannot contain values after the decimal.

### Step 2 - Add code to perform division using literal decimal data.

To see division working properly, we need to use a data type that supports fractional digits after the decimal point like `decimal`.

Add the following line of code:

```csharp-interactive
decimal decimalQuotient = 7.0m / 5;
Console.WriteLine("Decimal quotient: " + decimalQuotient);
```

If you run the code, you will see the following output:

```output
Decimal quotient: 1.4
```

In order for this to work, the quotient (left of the assignment operator) must be of type `decimal` **and** either the dividend *or* divisor must be of type `decimal` (*or* both).

Here are two additional examples that work equally well:

```csharp
decimal decimalQuotient = 7 / 5.0m;
decimal decimalQuotient = 7.0m / 5.0m;
```

However, the following lines of code won't work (or give inaccurate results):

```csharp
int decimalQuotient = 7 / 5.0m;
int decimalQuotient = 7.0m / 5;
int decimalQuotient = 7.0m / 5.0m;
decimal decimalQuotient = 7 / 5;
```

### Step 3 - Add code to perform division using literal decimal data

What if you are not working with literal values?  In other words, what if you need to divide two variables of type `int` but do not want the result truncated?  In that case, you must perform a data type cast from `int` to `decimal`.  Casting is one type of data conversion that instructs the compiler to temporarily treat a value as if it were a different data type.

To cast `int` to `decimal`, you add the cast operator before the value.  You use the name of the data type surrounded by parenthesis in front of the value to cast it.  In this case, we would add `(decimal)` before the variables `first` and `second`.

Modify the code in the .NET Editor to the following code:

```csharp-interactive
int first = 7;
int second = 5;
decimal quotient = (decimal)first / (decimal)second;
Console.WriteLine(quotient);
```
If you run the code, you'll see the following output:

```output
1.4
```

> [!Note]
> We've seen three uses, or overloads, for the parenthesis operator: method invocation, order of operations and casting.

### Step 4 - Write code to determine the remainder after int division

The remainder operator `%` tells you the remainder of `int` division.  What you really learn from this is whether one number is divisible by another.  This can be useful during long processing operations when looping through hundreds or thousands of data records and you want to provide feedback to the end user after every 100 data records have been processed.

```csharp-interactive
Console.WriteLine("Modulus of 200 / 5 : " + (200 % 5));
Console.WriteLine("Modulus of 7 / 5: " + (7 % 5));
```
Run the code.  You should see the following output:

```output
Modulus of 200 / 5 : 0
Modulus of 7 / 5: 2
```

When the modulus is 0, that means the dividend is divisible by the divisor.

## Order of Operations

As we learned in the previous exercise, we can use the `()` symbols as the *order of operations* operators.  However, this isn't the only way the order of operations is determined.

In math, PEMDAS is an acronym that helps students remember the order in which multiple operations are performed.  The order is:

1. **P**arentheses (whatever is inside the parenthesis is performed first)
2. **E**xponents
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

C# follows the same order as PEMDAS except for exponents.  While there's no exponent operator in C#, you can use the `System.Math.Pow()` method, which is available from the .NET Class Library.  The module "Call methods from the .NET Class Library using C#" will feature this method and others.

### Step 4 - Write code to exercise C#'s order of operations

Modify the code example by commenting out the previous code and adding this new code:

```csharp-interactive
int value1 = 3 + 4 * 5;
int value2 = (3 + 4) * 5;
Console.WriteLine(value1);
Console.WriteLine(value2);
```
Here we see the difference when performing the same operations in a different order.

Now, run the code.  You should see the following result.

```output
23
35
```

## Recap

- Use operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` to perform basic mathematical operations.
- The division of two `int` values will result in the truncation of any values after the decimal point.  To retain values after the decimal point, you need to cast the divisor or dividend (or both) to from `int` into a floating point number like `decimal` first, then the quotient must be of the same floating point type as well in order to avoid truncation.
- Perform a cast operation to temporarily treat a value as if it were a different data type.
- Use the `%` operator to capture the remainder after division.
- The order of operations will follow the rules of the acronym PEMDAS.
