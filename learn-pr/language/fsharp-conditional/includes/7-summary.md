In this module, you learned how to apply conditional logic to a program. By adding conditional logic, you create multiple execution paths through the program. Most programs have multiple paths because that makes a program flexible.

You explored the `if...elif...else` construct and learned how to apply it. Conditional logic in F# is different from how most languages do conditional logic. In F#, conditional logic runs expressions that produce a value.

Finally, you were presented with three types of loops: `for...in`, `for...to`, and `while...do`. The functionality of the three loop constructs varies, so which loop you might use depends on your objective. `for...in` iterates over an enumerable collection. `for...to` iterates until a looping variable is reached, whether it's incrementing or decrementing that value. `while...do` focuses on a Boolean condition that, when evaluated to `false`, breaks the loop.
