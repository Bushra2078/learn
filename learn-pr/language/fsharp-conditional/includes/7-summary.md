In this module, you looked to learn how to apply conditional logic to your program. By adding conditional logic to your program, you create multiple execution paths through your program. Most programs have multiple paths as that makes the programs flexible.

You explored the `if...elif...else` construct and learned how to apply it. Conditional logic differs in F# from how most languages do conditional logic. It differs in the sense that it runs expressions that produce a value.

Finally you were presented to three different types of loops, `for...in`, `for...to`, and, `while...do`. The three looping constructs have slightly different functionality. The first one iterates over an enumerable collection. The second one is iterating until a looping variable is reached, whether its incrementing or decrementing to that value. The last one focuses on a boolean condition that when evaluated to false breaks the loop.
