Your program consists of a set of statements. How these statements are run is dependent on what programming constructs you use. The statements could be run from top to bottom but the program could also omit to run certain statements depending on conditions in the code. We refer to such a phenomenon as the code having several paths through it, or _branches_.

In this module, you will learn to construct conditional logic to create multiple execution paths through your code and you will learn to see the use of doing so. Additionally you will be introduced to looping constructs that enable you to repeat statements. Finally we'll have a look at something called pattern matching, a powerful feature that makes it possible to be expressive and clear and take on more of a functional approach.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Use `if...elif...else` to add conditional logic to your code.
- Create repeat statements using various loop constructs.
- Understand the difference between various loop constructs and when to use them.
