  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What construct would you use to iterate over an enumerable collection?
      choices:
        - content: You can use a `for...in` loop.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This loop construct is the most suited to iterate over a collection.
        - content: You can use a `for...to`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. It's possible to use a `for...to` construct but `for...in` is a better choice.
        - content: You can use a `while...do`
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A `while...do` is more meant to repeat a set of statements until a condition is met. Using a `for...in` is a better choice.
    - content: Explain what is wrong with the following code, `let value = if condition then true else 1`
      choices: 
        - content: Nothing is wrong, the code will compile.
          explanation: Incorrect. You can't mix data types, you either need the `if` and `else` to resolve to both resolve to boolean or to int.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: You can't assign the result to a variable.
          explanation: Incorrect. You can assign to a variable, but it needs to be the same data type in both `if` and `else`. 
          isCorrect: false
        - content: It needs to be the same data type in `if` and `else`. The following code would work `let value = if condition then 2 else 1`
          explanation: Correct. It needs to be the same data type returned from the expressions in `if` and `else`.
          isCorrect: true
    - content: Which numbers would the following loop print `for i = 0 to 5 do printfn "%i " i`?
      choices:
        - content: It will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
          explanation: Incorrect. It will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5
          isCorrect: false
        - content: I will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
          explanation: Correct. It will print all numbers from the start boundary including the ending boundary.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: I will print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
          explanation: Incorrect. It will print all numbers from the start boundary including the ending boundary, which is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 , 5. 
          isCorrect: false
