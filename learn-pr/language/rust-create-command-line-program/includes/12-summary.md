Congratulations! You've written a modern Rust command-line application! With the journal application, you can: add new tasks to a list, remove completed tasks, and print all outstanding tasks.

You can now compile the program in release mode and share the compiled program with the world. To compile the program, go to the terminal and run the command `cargo run --release`.

The compiled binary (the *executable* file) will be in the `target/release/` directory, and will be named after the project name. If you're using macOS or Linux, it will be called `rusty-journal`. If you're using Windows, it will be called `rusty-journal.exe`.

You can call it from your command-line directly now. No need for Cargo anymore! Just make sure that its directory is listed in your `PATH` environment variable.
