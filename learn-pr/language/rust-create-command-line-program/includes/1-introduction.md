In this final module, we'll develop a modern, real-world Rust program.

The application is a command-line to-do tracker. It records our tasks into a text file, displays them as a list in the terminal, and lets us mark them complete.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- How to develop a real-world command-line program by using tested third-party crates for command-line parsing and error handling.

## Prerequisites

- Have your Rust development environment set up.
- Know how to create, edit, and run Rust code by using Cargo.
- Know how to split code into multiple modules.
- Be familiar with using third-party crates.
- Understand common concepts, including variables, data types, and functions.
- Understand generic data types.
