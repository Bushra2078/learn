The `tasks` module will represent our tasks, and how we will save and access them.

Create a new file in the src directory named `tasks.rs`. Inside of that file, we'll start by defining a simple struct to represent what a to-do item will look like in our program:

```rust
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Task {
    pub text: String,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

Our struct has two fields:

- `text` stores the task description, like `"pay the bills"`.
- `created_at` stores the timestamp of the task's creation.

We won't add a `status` or `is_complete` field because we'll represent the to-do list as a vector of tasks (`Vec<Task>`). So when a task is complete, we can simply remove it from the vector.

You might have noticed that we're using a third-party crate, `chrono`. We've specified the `Utc` parameter for its `DateTime` struct. `chrono` is a good crate to use if you need to
handle date and time data in Rust. It provides an easy API for representing a moment in time.

Because we're using it, we need to declare it in the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
structopt = "0.3"
chrono = "0.4"
```

The next step is to implement a method for instantiating new tasks. Tasks will always be timestamped with the current date and time. Add the following code after the `Task` struct:

```rust
impl Task {
    pub fn new(text: String) -> Task {
        let created_at: DateTime<Utc> = Utc::now();
        Task { text, created_at }
    }
}
```

This code defines the `Task::new` function. The function requires only the task description. It will capture the current timestamp by using the `Utc::now()` method.

It seems that our task struct is complete. Now let's tackle this module's next item:
*persistence*.

Because we'll represent our to-do list as a vector of tasks, we could easily use a JSON file to persist the data. To achieve that, the best course of action is to use another excellent crate from the Rust ecosystem: `serde_json`.

## Serialize and deserialize tasks by using `serde_json`

Before we continue, we should cover some recommended practices for encoding and decoding in Rust.

When we need to persist structs and enum instances, we need to think about *serialization*. When we need to get that data back into a program, weâ€™re talking about *deserialization*.

Serialization and deserialization are the processes of storing data in a stream of bytes and then retrieving it for later use, without any loss of information. You can then send those bytes over a connection or store them in a file in a storage device. You can learn more about [serialization and deserialization from this OWASP cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html?azure-portal=true).

The Rust community recommends the `serde` crate for handling most serialization and deserialization of Rust data structures efficiently and generically, ours included. By using this preexisting crate, we can be even more productive and idiomatic.

To get started with serializing our `Task` type, we'll need two crates:

- `serde`. The base crate that will enable our types to derive the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits.
- `serde_json`. The crate that will implement those traits into our chosen file specification
format, JSON.

As always, the first step is to include `serde_json` and `serde` in the `[dependencies]` section of our `Cargo.toml` file. This time we're going to use a different notation to specify them because we'll need to conditionally compile some `serde` features. Your file should now look like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
structopt = "0.3"
serde_json = "1.0"    # Add serde_json.

[dependencies.serde]  # Add serde in its own section.
version = "1.0"
features = ["derive"] # We'll need the derive feature.

[dependencies.chrono]
version = "0.4"
features = ["serde"]  # We're also going to need the serde feature for the chrono crate, so we can serialize the DateTime field.
```

We should now be able to adapt the `Task` struct to use the new features from `serde`. Open the `tasks.rs` file and modify the struct so it looks like this:

```rust
use chrono::{serde::ts_seconds, DateTime, Local, Utc};
use serde::Deserialize;
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct Task {
    pub text: String,

    #[serde(with = "ts_seconds")]
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

Note the differences:

- We added `Deserialize` and `Serialize` to our list of traits to implement.
- We annotated the `created_at` field, passing `ts_seconds` from `chrono` to the `serde(with = ...)` attribute so `chrono` can inform `serde` how its `Datetime` type will implement the two new traits.

Now that our `Task` type can do both serialization and deserialization, we can move on and implement our file handling functions.

## Interact with the file system

Let's review the three kinds of actions our program needs to perform:

- Add new tasks to a to-do list.
- Remove completed tasks from that list.
- Print all the current tasks in the list.

Our module interface should be as simple as that list, so we're going to have three functions, one for each action:

```rust
use std::io::Result;
use std::path::PathBuf;

pub fn add_task(journal_path: PathBuf, task: Task) -> Result<()> { ... }

pub fn complete_task(journal_path: PathBuf, task_position: usize) -> Result<()> { ... }

pub fn list_tasks(journal_path: PathBuf) -> Result<()> { ... }
```

First, take a look at each function's signature. Notice that all of them require a `journal_path:
PathBuf` argument. That's because all of them need a file path to complete their work: the path to the file where the tasks will be stored.

- `add_task` also requires a `Task` argument. That argument specifies the task that will be added to the list.
- `complete_task` requires a `task_position` argument to indicate which `Task` will be removed. When a task is removed, that means it's completed.
- `list_tasks` doesn't need any additional information. It will just present to the user all tasks currently stored in the journal file, in a pretty format.

The functions all have the same return type: `std::io::Result<()>`. This format indicates that the return type is an I/O result. This return type signals that we're expecting a broad family of unwanted outcomes that might arise when we deal with data in the physical word. The `Ok` variant is just an empty tuple, `()`, which is the type commonly associated with no data at all. Its only purpose is to signal that the function returned an `Ok` and no errors occurred.

In the next three units, we'll walk through writing the contents of each function in detail.
