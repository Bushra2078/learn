A struct is a type that's composed of other types. Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types. But in a struct, you can name each piece of data so it's clear what the values mean.

Structs in Rust come in three flavors: classic structs, tuple structs, and unit structs.

```rust
// A struct with named fields
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    likes_oranges: bool,
}

// A tuple struct
struct Point2D(u32, u32);

// A unit struct
struct Unit;
```

- **Classic [C structs][Wikipedia-C]** are the most commonly used. Each field defined within them has a name and a type. After they're defined, they can be accessed by using `example_struct.field` syntax.
- **Tuple structs** are similar to classic structs, but their fields have no names. For accessing individual variables, the same syntax is used as with regular tuples, namely, `foo.0`, `foo.1`, and so on, starting at zero.
- **Unit structs** are most commonly used as markers. We'll learn more about why these structs can be useful when we learn about Rust's traits feature.


## Instantiate structs

After we define a struct, we use it by creating an instance and specifying concrete values for each field.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Instantiate a classic struct, with named fields. Order does not matter.
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Adam"),
        likes_oranges: true,
        age: 25
    };

    // Instantiate a tuple struct by passing the values in the same order as defined.
    let origin = Point2D(0, 0);

    // Instantiate a unit struct.
    let unit = Unit;

    // Display the details of the person
    if person.likes_oranges {
        println!("{:?} is {:?} and likes oranges.", person.name, person.age);  
    } else {
        println!("{:?} is {:?} and doesn't like oranges.", person.name, person.age);  
    }
}
```

You can interact with the preceding example in this [Rust Playground][RustPlay-structs].


## Enums

Enums are types that can be any one of several variants.

What Rust calls enums are more commonly known as [algebraic data types][Wikipedia-algebraic]. The important detail is that each enum variant can have data to go along with it.

The `enum` keyword allows the creation of a type, which might be one of a few different variants. Enum variants, just like structs, can have fields with names, fields without names, or no fields at all.

In the following example, we define an enum to classify a web event. Each variant is independent and stores different amounts and types of values.

```rust
enum WebEvent {
    // An enum can be unit-like
    PageLoad,
    PageUnload,

    // Or it can include characters and strings
    KeyPress(char),
    Paste(String),

    // Or it can include tuple structs
    Click(Click)
}
```

This enum has four variants with different types:

- `PageLoad` and `PageUnload` have no data associated with it at all.
- `Keypress` includes a single character in it.
- `Paste` includes a single string.
- `Click` includes an anonymous struct inside it.

Defining an enum with variants such as the preceding one is similar to defining different kinds of struct definitions. All the variants are grouped together under the same `WebEvent` type and each variant isn't its own type. We can't have functions that only accept `KeyPress` and not other variants of the `WebEvent` enum.

We can choose to define separate structs for each variant and then have each variant hold on to the different structs. These structs would hold the same data that the preceding enum variants held. But this definition allows users to refer to each logical variant on its own.

```rust
enum WebEvent {
    PageLoad,
    PageUnload,
    KeyPress(KeyPress),
    Paste(String),
    Click(Click)
}

struct Click { 
    x: i64, 
    y: i64 
}

struct KeyPress(char);
```

In your code, you can refer to a `WebEvent::Click`, which is a variant of the type `WebEvent`. You can also refer to a `Click` on its own, separate from the `WebEvent`.
