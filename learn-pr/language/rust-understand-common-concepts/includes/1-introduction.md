In this module, we'll learn concepts that are common to almost every programming language and how
they work in Rust. Even though they're not unique to Rust, these foundations will be in every Rust
program. Learning these concepts will give you a strong core to start from.

## The Rust Playground

The [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org?azure-portal=true) is a browser interface to the Rust compiler. You can use it to experiment with the language before you install it locally. You can also use it in any other case where you might not have the compiler available.

The Rust Playground can run simple snippets of Rust code. It can even quickly load and save your code to a GitHub Gist and share it with your friends.

Throughout this course, we'll give Playground links to our examples and exercises. This way you can interact with the code, even if you don't have the Rust toolchain available at the moment.

Every bit of code that runs on the Rust Playground can also be compiled and run in your local development environment. Don't be discouraged to interact with the Rust compiler from your computer too.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Use the `let` statement to assign values to variables.
- Learn how to comment your code to make it more descriptive.
- Discover the basic data types that exist in the Rust standard library.
- Write your own functions.
- Use collections to store multiple values in a single structure.
- Learn how to use conditional statements and loops in your code.

## Prerequisites

- Have your Rust development environment already set up.
- Know how to create, edit, and run Rust code by using Cargo.

If you need help with installing these prerequisites, follow the instructions in the previous module.
