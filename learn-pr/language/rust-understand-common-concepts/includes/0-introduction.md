In this module, we learn about common concepts in programming languages, and discover how they're implemented in Rust. The concepts aren't unique to Rust, but they provide a foundation for every Rust program. By learning about these concepts, you can gain an understanding to support development in any programming language.


## The Rust Playground

The [Rust Playground][RustPlay] is a browser interface to the Rust compiler. You can use it to experiment with the language before you install it locally. You can also use it in any other case where you might not have the compiler available.

The Rust Playground can run simple snippets of Rust code. It can even quickly load and save your code to a GitHub gist and share it with your friends.

Throughout this course, we'll give Playground links to our examples and exercises. You can interact with the code, even if you don't have the Rust toolchain available at the moment.

All code that runs on the Rust Playground can also compile and run in your local development environment. Don't be discouraged to interact with the Rust compiler from your computer.


## Rust documentation

This module provides an overview of common programming concepts with an emphasis on how they're implemented in Rust. We cover basic functionality, language structures, keywords, syntax, and usage. We review the language features at a high level and only describe in detail the concepts necessary to complete the unit exercises. If you want to learn more about the Rust programming language, see the [Rust documentation][Rust-docs] online. You'll find conceptual articles and reference materials for the language.


## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn about the basic structure of a Rust program.
- Use the `let` statement to assign values to variables.
- Learn how to comment your code to make it more descriptive.
- Discover the basic data types that exist in the Rust standard library.
- Write your own functions.
- Use collections to store multiple values in a single structure.
- Learn how to use conditional statements and loops in your code.

## Prerequisites

- Have your Rust development environment already set up.
- Know how to create, edit, and run Rust code by using Cargo.

If you need help with installing these prerequisites, follow the instructions in the [Get started with Rust][Get-started] module.
