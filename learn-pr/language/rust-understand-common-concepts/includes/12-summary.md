In this module, you learned:

- The `main` function is the entry point into any Rust program.
- The `let` keyword declares a variable. You can create a variable as mutable or immutable.
- The Rust standard library supports primitive data types like integers, strings, booleans, and so on.
- How to declare your own types with structs and enums.
- How to write your own functions.
- How to use the tuple, array, vector, and hash map collection types.
- How to control the flow of code execution with loops and conditional statements.

In the next module in this Learning Path, you'll dig deeper into how errors and failures are handled in Rust code.
