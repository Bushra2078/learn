In this module you wrote your first lines of F# code and build your first console application. In the process, you also learned:

- F# is an open-source, cross-platform programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, performant, robust, and practical code
- F# runs anywhere .NET runs and with the Fable compiler, it can also run in JavaScript environments.
- You can use professional-grade tooling like Visual Studio Code paired with the Ionide extension as well as Visual Studio.
- F# Interactive helps you go from idea to code instantly by evaluating code in real-time.
