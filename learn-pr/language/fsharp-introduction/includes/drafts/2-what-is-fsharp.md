F# is an open-source, cross-platform, general-purpose, functional-first programming language for .NET.

## Why F#?

There are many language features and aspects of the F# language that make it easy to be productive when writing code:

- **Lightweight syntax**: F# lets you be productive without writing too much code. Its lightweight syntax let you focus on the core components of your application.
- **Strong type system**: Despite being able to interactively interpret code through scripts and F# Interactive, .NET is a statically-typed language with a strong type system helping you feel confident your code works once your code compiles.
- **Type inference**: As a result of its strong type system, the compiler is able to analyze your code and infer the types of applications you're working with without explicitly defining them.
- **Interactive programming**: F# via F# Interactive provides scripting capabilities. Instead of compiling your code inside an F# project, you can get started writing and evaluating your code logic interactively via the console or through script files. For more visual environments such as when building visualizations, you can use tools like .NET noteboks via .NET Interactive.
- **Immutable by default**: Having immutability by default makes you can process your data without affecting the original data. Therefore you're able to apply changes to your data and have a high degree of certainty in what the outcome is.
- **Works with .NET libraries**: The .NET ecosystem has a rich ecosystem of libraries. As a .NET language, F# can take advantage of those libraries and use them inside your applications.
- **Null value handling**: Errors in an application due to null values can be costly. As a result, code bases can often be riddled with code to check for and handle null values. In F#, you can use the `Option` type to safely handle scenarios where `null` values may arise.
- **Strong & passionate community**: F# would not be what it is without its vibrant and passionate community building libraries, tools, and evangelizing the language.

## What type of applications can I build with F#?

F# runs anywhere .NET runs. That means you can leverage the vast .NET ecosystem and tools to build different kind of applications such as:

- Web APIs
- Single-Page applications (SPA)
- WebAssembly
- Desktop
- Big data
- Data science & machine learning
- Internet-of-Things (IoT)
- Gaming
