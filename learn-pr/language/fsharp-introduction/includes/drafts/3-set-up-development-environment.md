To get started writing code with F#, you'll need at a minimum the .NET SDK. The .NET SDK provides you with the base set of libraries and tools for developing. 

Once you have the .NET SDK installed, you can begin writing F# code scripts or entire applications in your preferred text editor or IDE.

Visual Studio Code is an open-source, cross-platform text editor that when paired with the Ionide provides you with a rich set of features for building F# applications.
