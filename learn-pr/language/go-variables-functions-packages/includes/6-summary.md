We've covered the basics of what you need to start building more complex applications in Go. You now know a few ways to declare and initialize variables and the various data types that Go provides. And you've used the most basic data types.

You've also learned how to create functions to organize your code and make it more maintainable. You've learned that Go is a "pass by value" language, but that it also supports pointers. We'll use pointers in some of the upcoming modules.

Finally, you learned how packages work in Go and how to create modules when you want to share your code with other developers. You learned that if you need to create only a standalone application, all your code needs to be part of the `main` package. You learned that the starting point of that program is the `main()` function. And you now understand how to reference local and third-party modules. You'll be using those modules a lot when you build Go programs.
