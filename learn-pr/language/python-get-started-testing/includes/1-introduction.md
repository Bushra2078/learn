Testing is a core practice in professional engineering. Having a good grasp of testing and leveraging its strengths is critical for developing robust software. However, it's easy to get overwhelmed by testing itself. There are different types of testing and several tools and libraries that try to achieve similar goals. 

This module clarifies some of the concepts behind testing, mainly how they exist in Python. From `unittest` (Python's standard library module) to the different types of testing and when to apply those techniques.

## Scenario

Imagine you are put in charge of a Python project with tests written using the `unittest` module. There aren't many tests and the manager has asked you to evaluate and propose different test strategies to enhance the project.

## What you will learn

In this module, you'll understand how Python's standard library module works and what are the different types of testing along with their challenges. This will allow you to:

- Work with existing or new tests written with the `unittest` module.
- Understand the differences between testing types and when to apply them
- Describe some of the common challenges when testing

## What is the main goal

By the end of this module, you'll feel comfortable discussing different testing strategies and identifying challenges. Additionally, you'll be able to work with existing `unittest` tests or write new ones.
