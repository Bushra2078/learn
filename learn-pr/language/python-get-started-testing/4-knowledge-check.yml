  questions:
  - content: "What is `unittest` and how do I get it?"
    choices:
    - content: "`unittest` is a Python testing module and library that you can pip install"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`unittest` is a Python testing module and library, but you don't install it."
    - content: "`unittest` is a Python standard library test class for writing unit tests"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`unittest` is a module that includes a test class, but isn't a test class itself."
    - content: "`unittest` is a Python standard library module for writing and running tests."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "What is the naming convention for writing tests to use auto discovery?"
    choices:
    - content: "Filenames, classes, and methods need to be prefixed with the word 'test'."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Filenames and classes need to be prefixed with 'test', and methods with 'test_'."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although 'test_' is common in methods, the underscore isn't required."
    - content: "Filenames, classes, and methods need to be prefixed with 'test_'."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although 'test_' would work for auto discovery, the underscore isn't required."
  - content: "What is the name of the unittest class that test classes must inherit from?"
    choices:
    - content: "`TestClass`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`TestClass` isn't a part of the `unittest` module."
    - content: "`TestCase`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "`UnitTestCase`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`UnitTestCase` isn't a part of the `unittest` module."
  - content: "What is the correct Python invocation to use test auto discovery?"
    choices:
    - content: "`python -m autodiscovery`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`autodiscovery` isn't a Python module, so this invocation wouldn't work."
    - content: "`python -m discovery`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`discovery` isn't a Python module, so this invocation wouldn't work."
    - content: "`python -m unittest`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "What are three common assert methods from `unittest`?"
    choices:
    - content: "`assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "`assertEquality`, `assertIsTrue`, `assertIsFalse`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These methods aren't part of the `TestCase` class."
    - content: "`assert`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although `assertTrue` and `assertFalse` are commonly used, `assert` isn't a valid method of the `TestCase` class."
