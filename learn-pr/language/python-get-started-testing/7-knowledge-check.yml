quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is one common side-effect for functions when there are no tests involved?"
    choices:
    - content: "Functions will run faster because they don't need to use tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Functions don't depend on tests to run."
    - content: "Functions can grow in complexity and size."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When a function is not tested, it is common to see it grow and become more complex."
    - content: "Functions will run slower and have more arguments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it is possible that a function may run slower and have more arguments, these are not related to not having tests."
  - content: "What is a recognizable aspect in functions and methods when testing is involved?"
    choices:
    - content: "They tend to have a single responsibility instead of doing many different things"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Code that is well tested tends to concentrate on a single responsibility."
    - content: "They are more flexible, allowing more arguments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Flexibility and allowing more arguments aren't usually the effects of testing."
    - content: "They don't tend to raise exceptions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Code can raise exceptions even when they are tested thoroughly."
  - content: "What is a negative effect of unreliable (flaky) tests?"
    choices:
    - content: "The error reporting becomes harder to read"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An unreliable test does not necessarily affect the error reporting."
    - content: "It causes a test suite to be slower."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An unreliable test is not directly related to the speed of a test suite."
    - content: "You can't tell if the code needs to be changed or if a patch has introduced a regression."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! An unreliable test might fail for unrelated reasons which makes it hard to understand the failure."
  - content: "What is one aspect of unit testing?"
    choices:
    - content: "No external services like databases or network services are needed for them to run."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Unit tests are usually as isolated as possible and will not require other services to run."
    - content: "Unit tests cover as much as possible of a software project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this test type can have high coverage, it isn't a recognizable aspect from unit testing."
    - content: "Unit tests concentrate in testing a single function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although a unit test can test a single function, this isn't always the case."
  - content: "What is an attribute of functional testing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Functional testing can interact with different parts of the codebase"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Even if a functional test can interact with different parts, this isn't an accurate attribute."
    - content: "It usually requires running an application as a whole"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's right! A functional test will probably need running the whole application in an environment resembling production."
    - content: "Uses all of the data from a production environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A functional test doesn't always need all the data from a production environment to execute."
