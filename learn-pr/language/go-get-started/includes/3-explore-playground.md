You can use the [Go Playground][GoPlay] to run Go code inside a sandbox environment. The tool is most often used to share code snippets with other developers in forums.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Feel free to use the Go Playground for learning purposes.
> For more complex development, we recommend you install Go locally. Use an integrated development environment (IDE) to improve your development productivity.

The Go Playground has some limitations that can affect your learning journey:

- Keyboard inputs aren't supported.
- Random numbers are deterministic.
- Time is constant. You get the same value every time.

To begin using the Go Playground, select the **Run** button.
