We mentioned earlier in this module that if you donâ€™t want to install Go on your local workstation yet, you can use the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/?azure-portal=true), a website that compiles and runs Go code inside a sandbox environment. This is the tool you would ordinarily use for sharing code snippets with other developers when you're sharing a solution in forums.

Be aware that the Go Playground comes with a few limitations that might affect your learning journey. For example:

- Keyboard inputs are not supported.
- Random numbers are deterministic.
- Time is constant. You get the same value every time.

To begin using the Go Playground, select the **Run** button.

Feel free to continue using this site for learning purposes, but we highly recommend installing Go locally and using an integrated development environment (IDE) to improve your development productivity.
