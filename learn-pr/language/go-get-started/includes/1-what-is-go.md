Go is a programming language that was developed at Google. It was announced in 2009 as an open-source project by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Since then, Go has been used for developing other well-known technologies like [Docker][DockerWebsite], [Kubernetes][KubernetesWebsite], and [Terraform][TerraformWebsite]. But Go is a general-purpose language too with an abundance different use cases.

Go is expressive, concise, and clean. It is designed to be idiomatic, which allows programmers to productively write code that is efficient and robust. Go runs on Unix systems, such as Linux and macOS, and also supports Windows. One feature that makes Go unique is its concurrency mechanism, making it easy to write programs that can do multiple things at the same time. It is a strongly statically typed, meaning variable types are known at compile time, although it has some dynamically typed capabilities.

According to the [TIOBE index][TIOBE], [Go was the programming language of the year][GoAwards] in 2009 and 2016. Although it reached its apex in 2016, Go [maintains a high rating][GoRating]. According to the [annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey][StackSurvey], Go continues as a top-loved language. 

Go has many similarities with C and inherits many aspects of C syntax. Go implements control-flow statements, basic data types, pointers, and other elements. However, Go is more than an up-to-date version of C. It also has many similarities with Java. Go borrows and adapts from other programming languages, but also removes overly complex features. Some portions of the object-oriented programming paradigm aren't implemented as fully in Go. You'll learn why later in this Learning path.

## Go principles

Here are the underlying principles benefits of the Go programming language:

- The Go license is 100% open source.
- Go programs compile to a single binary, making it easy to share and distribute.
- Cross-compiling to a variety of platforms and operating systems
- Go strives to keep things small and simple, and to do more in fewer lines of code.
- Concurrency is a first-class citizen, and allows functions to run as lightweight threads.
- Go provides automatic memory management including garbage collection.
- Compilation and execution are fast.
- Go requires that all code be used, or else and error is thrown.
- There's official formatting that helps to maintain consistency across projects.
- Go prefers to use standard libraries, so isn't a good friend of frameworks.
- Go guarantees backward compatibility with past releases.


## Go use cases
- Systems level applications
- Web applications
- Cloud-native applications
- Utilities and command line tools
- Distributed systems
- Database implementations
