Go is a programming language that was developed at Google. It was announced in 2009 as an open-source project by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Since then, Go has been used for developing other well-known technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. But Go is a general-purpose language too. The goal of the language is to allow programmers to be expressive, efficient, and effective when writing reliable and robust code.

According to the [TIOBE index][TIOBE], [Go was the programming language of the year][GoAwards] in 2009 and 2016. Although it reached its apex in 2016, Go [maintains a high rating][GoRating]. According to the [annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey][StackSurvey], Go continues as a top-loved language. 

Go has many similarities with C and inherits many aspects of C syntax. Go implements control-flow statements, basic data types, pointers, and other elements. However, Go is more than an up-to-date version of C. Go borrows and adapts from other programming languages, but also removes overly complex features. Some portions of the object-oriented programming paradigm aren't implemented as fully in Go. You'll learn why later in this Learning path.

Go is idiomatic about source code formats and disallows unused code. It doesn't require an IDE, and prefers standard libraries over frameworks. Go also offers a different approach to concurrent programming and error handling.

Go runs on Unix systems, such as Linux and macOS, and also supports Windows.

## Go principles

Here are the underlying principles behind the Go programming language:

- Go strives to keep things small and simple, to do more in fewer lines of code.
- Concurrency is a first citizen, and functions can run as lightweight threads.
- Compilation and execution are fast, with the aim to be as fast as C.
- Go requires casting to be explicit, or else it throws a compilation error.
- Any code that's not used is an error, and it won't compile.
- There's an official formatting that helps to maintain consistency across projects.
- Go isn't a good friend of frameworks, because it prefers to use standard libraries.
- Go guarantees backward compatibility.
- The Go license is 100% open source.
