In this module, you’ll start taking your first steps with Go. You’ll learn a little about the history of Go and the main features of this programming language. You'll then install and configure Go on your workstation. Next, you’ll explore another way you can play with Go without having to install anything on your workstation. You’ll also learn how Go requires you to organize your code to help prevent problems when you need to develop complex applications.

At the end of the module, you’ll create your first “Hello World!” application in Go, and you’ll be ready to continue learning more about how to build applications by using Go.
