Our goal in this module was to guide you through your first steps with Go, set up a working environment where you can create more projects in Go, and use Visual Studio Code to write programs rapidly following the Go standards. By creating a typical *Hello World!* program, you learned how to compile and run programs written in Go.

To avoid having problems in the future, keep in mind that all projects in Go share the same workspace on your computer. A practice we recommend is to create all your projects within the *$GOPATH/src* directory. However, there are times when you might need to create projects at a different location. In an upcoming module, we’ll talk about how you can store your project code at a different location.

Finally, you learned the difference between the *go build* and *go run* commands. The *go build* command compiles the program and, if there are no errors, it generates a binary executable file that you can run without using Go. You ordinarily use this command to generate the application binaries that you’ll use to deploy the application to a different environment. And the *go run* command compiles and executes the application without generating a binary. You’ll use this command when you develop and test your application locally.
