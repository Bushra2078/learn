You can use any text editor to write Go applications. An integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code helps you write code faster. An IDE provides language support, so you don't have to write every line from scratch. When you're learning a programming language, writing line-by-line helps you get familiar with the syntax. In the long term, writing code by hand takes longer to build an application. 

For this reason, we recommend you start by using Visual Studio Code, which is free and open-source. Visual Studio Code offers a Go extension to help you write code fast.

By using Visual Studio Code and the Go extension, you can:

- Format applications following Go standards.
- Add package references as soon as you add a new line and save your code.
- Remove package references that your application isn't using anymore.
- Debug your applications by setting breakpoints and using watchers at runtime.
- Get suggested completions for code and package references.
- Use hover information to connect to the code documentation.
- Get signature help, such as listing a function's parameters.
- Navigate the project code easily even if you have multiple files.
- Enlist support for testing, such as generating test skeletons for functions.
