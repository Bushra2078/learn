To put into practice everything you've learned in this module, we have some coding challenges for you. These challenges aren't complicated, and we'll give you our solution to each one. Try to solve them on your own first, and then compare your solution with ours. You can always go back to review the content if you don't remember something specific.

## Write a program to calculate the Fibonacci sequence

In this first challenge, you'll write a program to calculate the Fibonacci sequence from a number. You'll write a function that returns a slice with all the numbers in a Fibonacci sequence that results from doing the calculation from a number that users input greater than two. Let's assume that numbers lower than `2` will result in an error and return a nil slice.

Remember, the Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. For instance, the sequence of numbers for `6` is `1,1,2,3,5,8`, for `7` is `1,1,2,3,5,8,13`, for `8` is `1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21`, and so on.

## Create a Roman numerals translator

Write a program that translates a Roman numeral like `MCLX` to `1,160`. Use a map to load the basic Roman numerals that you'll use to translate a string character into a number. For instance, `M` will be a key in the map, and its value will be `1000`. Use the following string character map list:

* `M` => 1000
* `D` => 500
* `C` => 100
* `L` => 50
* `X` => 10
* `V` => 5
* `I` => 1

In case the user input comes with a different letter from the preceding list, print an error.

Remember, there will be cases where a smaller number precedes a larger number, so you can't merely sum the numbers. For instance, the number `MCM` should print `1,900`.
