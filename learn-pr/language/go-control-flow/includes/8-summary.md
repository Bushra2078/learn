At this point, you know how Go differs from other programming languages. For instance, Go doesn't require you to write parentheses in conditions for `if`, `for`, or `switch` statements. But you always need to write braces (`{}`). You can chain `if` statements, and an `else` clause is optional. Crucially, you can declare variables within an `if` condition, and their scope is only within the `if` block. You can't access those variables outside the block, even in the same function.

Go supports `switch` statements, and you don't have to write a condition. You can use just `case` clauses. Unlike other languages, in Go you don't need to write a `break` statement at the end of each `case` clause to avoid running other `case` clauses. 

By default, when Go enters into a `case` statement, it runs it and then exits the `switch` clause. To jump to the next `case` clause, use the `fallthrough` keyword. You can call a function from a `case` clause, and you can group multiple expressions in one `case` clause.

In this module, you also learned that in Go you use only the `for` keyword to write loops. But you can write infinite loops or `while` conditions. Go supports the `continue` keyword, so you can skip an iteration of a loop without exiting the loop.

Lastly, you learned about other Go control flows like the `defer`, `panic`, and `recover` functions. Go doesn't support exceptions. It deals with runtime errors by using a combination of the three functions.
