JavaScript doesn't support interfaces so, as a JavaScript developer, you may or may not have experience with them. In TypeScript, you can use interfaces as you would in traditional object-oriented programming. You can also use interfaces to define object types and this is the primary focus of this module.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript.
- Declare and instantiate an interface.
- Extend an interface.
- Declare an interface with custom array types.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with functions and arrays in JavaScript
- Installed software:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/?azure-portal=true)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/?azure-portal=true)
  - TypeScript - TypeScript can be installed after installing Node.js after running the following in a terminal or command window:

      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```

For best results, follow the complete instructions for setting up your environment and using the TypeScript compiler in [Module 01: Get started with TypeScript](/learn/modules/typescript-get-started/). After setting up your environment, you can run any of the Lab setup or solution files in the  [Build JavaScript applications by using TypeScript](/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/) learning path.
