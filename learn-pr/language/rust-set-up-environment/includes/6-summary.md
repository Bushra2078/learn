In this module, you installed Rust and the Visual Studio Code tools you need to write and run Rust programs. After your environment was set up, you built a basic "Hello World!" program and modified it to use Cargo to start a new project template.

In the next module in this learning path, you'll walk through some common programming concepts in Rust, including functions, data types, and control flow.
