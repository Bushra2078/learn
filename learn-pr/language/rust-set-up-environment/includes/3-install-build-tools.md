Rust requires the Microsoft C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later. These build tools must be installed before you can install Rust.

If you don't have the build tools installed, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Microsoft Visual Studio download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/?azure-portal=true).

1. Select **Download Build Tools**.

1. After the download completes, run the installer file. The Visual Studio Installer window opens.

1. In the popup dialog, select **Yes**. In the next popup dialog, select **Continue**.

1. In the Installer window, under **Desktop & Mobile**, select the checkbox for the **C++ build tools** option on the left. 

1. In the Installation details pane on the right, make sure the following options are selected:

After the installation completes, you can continue with the Rust installation.
