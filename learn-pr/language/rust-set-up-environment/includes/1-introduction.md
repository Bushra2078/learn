In this unit, we'll cover the steps to install and configure your development environment so you can start programming in Rust.

To program in Rust, install the Visual Studio Code editor, the Microsoft C++ build tools for Visual Studio Code, and the Rust language files.

After your environment is set up, we'll try a basic "Hello World!" program to confirm you're ready to go.

## Learning objectives

In this module, learn how to:

- Set up your development environment to use Rust.
- Compile and run a basic "Hello, world!" program.
