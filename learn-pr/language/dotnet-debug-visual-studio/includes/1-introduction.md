## Fix Bugs Before the Application Launches

Suppose you work for a team that is building a new application, but you keep finding bugs in the code.  The team would like to find and fix all of these issues before the app goes live. However, the issues are too subtle or complex to figure out just by reading the code. You're looking for additional tools and assistance to track down the problems while the app is running.

## What will we be doing?

This module shows you how to use the Visual Studio debugger with a .NET program. You'll see how to leverage common features like break points and step through your code line by line. You'll also learn how to inspect the state of your program as it executes using tools like the Watch and Locals windows. Finally, you'll also use diagnostic features like the Call Stack and Traces to review code execution in greater depth.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to use Visual Studio's debugging tools to analyze and fix issues in your application code.
