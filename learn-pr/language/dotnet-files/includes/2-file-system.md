.NET contains built-in types for working with the file system that can be found in the `System.IO` namespace.

Here, you'll learn how to use the types in `System.IO` by using C# to read the file system to discover files and directories.

## The scenario

Large retailers often write data to files so that it can be processed later in batches.

Tailwind Traders has each of its stores write its sales total to a file, and send that file to a central location. To use those files, the company needs to create a batch process that can work with the file system.

## Include the System.IO namespace

In the .NET, `System.IO` namespaces contain types to interact with files and directories. For example, you can get and set properties for files and directories, and retrieve collections of files and directories based on search criteria.

You can also use the types in the `System.IO` namespaces to read and write, both synchronously and asynchronously, data streams and files.

For now, we're going to focus on what you need to know to work with directories by using the `Directory` class contained in the `System.IO` namespace.

## List all directories

One task that you'll often do with the `Directory` class is list out or *enumerate* directories. For instance, Tailwind Traders has a root folder called *stores*. In that folder are subfolders organized by store number. Inside those folders are the sales-total and inventory files. The structure looks like this:

```
ðŸ“‚ stores
    ðŸ“„ sales.json
    ðŸ“„ totals.txt
    ðŸ“‚ 201
       ðŸ“„ sales.json
       ðŸ“„ salestotals.json
       ðŸ“„ inventory.txt
    ðŸ“‚ 202
```

To read through and list the names of the top-level directories, you can use the `Directory.EnumerateDirectories` function.

```csharp
IEnumerable<string> listOfDirectories = Directory.EnumerateDirectories("stores");

foreach (var dir in listOfDirectories) {
    Console.WriteLine(dir);
}

// Outputs:
// stores/201
// stores/202
```

## List files in a specific directory

To list the names of all of the files in a directory, you can use the `Directory.EnumerateFiles` function.

```csharp
IEnumerable<string> files = Directory.EnumerateFiles("stores");

foreach (var file in files)
{
    Console.WriteLine(file);
}

// Outputs:
// stores/totals.txt
// stores/sales.json
```

## List all content in a directory and all subdirectories

Both the `Directory.EnumerateDirectories` and `Directory.EnumerateFiles` functions have an overload that accepts a parameter to specify that search pattern files and directories must match.

They also have another overload that accepts a parameter to indicate whether to recursively traverse a specified folder and all of its subfolders.

```csharp
// Find all *.txt files in the stores folder and its subfolders
IEnumerable<string> allFilesInAllFolders = Directory.EnumerateFiles("stores", "*.txt", SearchOption.AllDirectories);

foreach (var file in allFilesInAllFolders)
{
    Console.WriteLine(file);
}

// Outputs:
// stores/totals.txt
// stores/201/inventory.txt
```

In the next exercise, you'll use the `Directory` class to dynamically read through Tailwind Traders' main *stores* directory to find all of the sales.json files.
