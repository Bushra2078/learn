.NET has powerful built-in mechanisms for working with the file system.

Assume for a moment that you work for a company called *Tailwind Traders*. Tailwind Traders is the second-largest online retailer in the world. It deals with mountains of data and files. The company has hired you to help it manage its data and files by using C# and .NET.

In this module, you'll write a program that searches through folders for sales files. When those files are found, you'll use C# and .NET to read and parse the sales-total data inside. Finally, you'll summarize those sales totals into one grand total and write that value to a new file.
