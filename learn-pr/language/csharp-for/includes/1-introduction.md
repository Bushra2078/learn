As mentioned previous modules, the C# programming language is similar to any human written or spoken language, inasmuch as you can choose different ways to express the same idea. Some words and phrases are more descriptive, accurate, or succinct than others.

There are several ways to add looping logic in your application, and depending on the context, each provides a nuanced set of features and pros and cons.

Suppose you need to iterate through a code block a specific number of times, or you need to control the manner in which the .NET Runtime performs the iteration. In these cases, you might choose the `for` iteration statement.

In this module, you'll write `for` statements to iterate a predetermined number of times. You'll change how the .NET runtime executes the `for` statement by instructing it to increment or decrement the iterator, skip values, and more. You'll write code to short circuit the `for` statement. Finally, you'll solve a coding challenge inspired by a common interview question.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to confidently build applications with looping logic.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Use the `for` statement to loop through a block of code.
- Modify how the .NET Runtime executes the looping logic, changing the value of the iterator, the condition, and the pattern.

## Prerequisites

- Experience with the `foreach` iteration statement
- Experience working with variables
