The Python programming language includes a library of functionality that you can use in your own programs.  It also includes tools that allow you to install additional third-party, open-source projects that dramatically speed up and simplify Python development.

Imagine that you've been asked to create a program that scrapes data from the internet, processes the information, saves the data to a file, and then uses the FTP internet protocol to send that file to a client's server.  If you had to program every detail yourself, it would take a long time.  Fortunately, you can use the Python standard library to leverage the work of others who have already written code to make this entire program possible, even trivial.

In this module, you'll explore the Python standard library.  You'll learn how to use thousands of pre-built functions spread over hundreds of modules, and how to extend that to leverage the work of the wider software development community. This community has created hundreds of thousands of Python packages that can cover every conceivable need.  You'll learn where you can go to research available packages, and how to install these packages locally and import them into your code.

By the end of this module, you will be able to write programs that can harness the power of the Python standard library and the Python community's body of work.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Explore the Python standard library.
- Add the `import` statement to tell the Python compiler which modules to use in your code.
- Use the `pip` utility to download third-party, open-source packages.

## Prerequisites

- A fully set-up Python development environment.
- An understanding of basic data types, such as strings and `int`, and how to create, set, and get values from a variable.
- Experience calling methods by using the member access operator `.` and passing arguments to functions.
