When you're creating pages that are based on data, you often need the ability to change the display according to certain values, or to display multiple items in an array. With Vue you can do these things through a variety of directives. This ability allows the use of HTML to control the output, which feels natural to many web developers.

In this module you'll explore how to display items in an array and how to implement conditional display logic.
