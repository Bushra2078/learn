When you're creating pages that are based on data, you might need to change the display according to certain values. Or, you may want to display multiple items in an array. 

By using Vue.js, you can do these things through directives. And doing so allows you to use HTML to control the output, which feels natural to many web developers.

In this module, you explore how to display items in an array and how to implement conditional display logic.
