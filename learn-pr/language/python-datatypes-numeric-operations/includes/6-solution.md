The following code is one possible solution to the challenge presented in the preceding unit.

```python
fahrenheit = input('What is the temperature in Fahrenheit?  ')

if fahrenheit.isnumeric() == False:
    print('Input is not a number.')
    exit()

fahrenheit = int(fahrenheit)

celsius = int((fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9)
print('Temperature in celsius is ' + str(celsius))
```

This code is merely *one possible solution*, because we didn't specify what to name the variables and other small implementation details.

As long as your program works in the best case scenario, and handles the worst case scenario, you were successful.

If you were successful, congratulations!  Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
