Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before you continue on.

In this challenge, you use what you've learned about user input and performing mathematical operations on it.

### Step 1: Add a new file to your working folder

Use the techniques you learned in previous modules to add a new code file in the current folder that's dedicated to this module.  For example, you might create a file named *challenge1.py*.

Use this file for the code you'll write in Step 2.

### Step 2: Write a program to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius

The mathematical formula for converting a temperature measured in Fahrenheit to a temperature measured in Celsius is shown in the following code:

```
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
```

Use this formula to build a program that prompts users for a temperature in Fahrenheit, performs the conversion to Celsius, and then displays the Celsius temperature.

If users enter the value *55* at the prompt, the program should produce the following output:

```output
What is the temperature in fahrenheit?  55
Temperature in celsius is 12
```

However, if users enter a bad value, the program should tell them that there's a problem and then exit.  For this scenario, if users enter the value *bob* at the prompt, your program should produce the following output:

```output
What is the temperature in fahrenheit?  bob
Input is not a number.
```

> [!NOTE]
> To double-check your work, use an online temperature converter and confirm that your program's result matches its result.
