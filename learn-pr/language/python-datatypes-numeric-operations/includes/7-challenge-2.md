In this second challenge, you combine what you learned about accepting user input and performing data conversions with what you previously learned about the `if...elif...else` statement.

Here, you build a limited calculator application that prompts users for two values and a mathematical operation, performs the calculation, and then formats and displays the output.

### Step 1: Add a new file to your working folder

Use the techniques you learned in previous modules to add a new code file in the current folder that's dedicated to this module.  For example, you might create a file named *challenge2.py*.

Use this file for the code you'll write in Step 2.

### Step 2: Write a program to accept two numbers and an operation, and then perform the operation on the two numbers

Build a simple calculator that accepts a first number, an operation, and a second number.

Here's an example output, where a user has entered *4*, *\**, and *5* at the prompts:

```output
Simple calculator!
First number? 4
Operation? *
Second number? 5
product of 4 * 5 equals 20
```

Your program should accept a symbol, such as the asterisk symbol (**\***), to perform a multiplication and produce a product.  Make sure that you implement logic for the following results:

- Sum
- Difference
- Product
- Quotient
- Exponent
- Modulus

If users fail to enter a numeric value, display the following message:

```output
Please input a number.
```

If users enter an operation that isn't recognized, display the following message:

```output
Operation not recognized.
```
