React is the most popular front-end JavaScript framework. You can use it to create both browser-based and locally installed applications. React introduces a new syntax called *JSX* to control the user interface.

We started this module by exploring the core concepts of React. We saw how React can help you create web applications. We explored the installation options and how to use a bundler to manage our JSX files. After creating our first project and components, we ran the code locally. We also mentioned other types of applications that React can help you create.

You learned how to:

- Understand the core concepts of React.
- Create a React application.
- Create a component.
