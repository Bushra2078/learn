React is the most popular front-end JavaScript framework. It can be used to create both browser based and locally installed applications. React introduces a new syntax called JSX for controlling the user interface.

We started by exploring the core concepts of React, and how React can help you create web applications. We looked through the installation options, and how to work with a bundler to manage our JSX files. We created our first project, our first components, and ran the site locally. We also chatted about the other types of applications React can help you create.

We learned how to:

- Understand the core concepts of React.
- Create a React application.
- Create a component.
