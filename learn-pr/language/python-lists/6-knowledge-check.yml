  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You have a five-item list, and you want to retrieve the last three items.  Which slice should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "`my_list[1:4]`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `my_list[1:4]` slice selects the middle three items."
    - content: "`my_list[:2]`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `my_list[:2]` slice selects the first two items."
    - content: "`my_list[:-3]`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `my_list[:-3]` slice selects the first two items."
    - content: "`my_list[-3:]`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following helper functions can you use to make your list simulate a queue?"
    choices:
    - content: "`remove()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `remove()` function removes the item from the list, but it's not the best choice."
    - content: "`pop()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `pop()` function selects and removes an item from a list. This behavior is similar to how a queue operates."
    - content: "`del()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no `del()` function."
    - content: "`clear()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `clear()` function removes all items from a list."
  - content: "What's the easiest way to find out whether a value belongs to a list?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the `find()` helper function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no `find()` helper function for lists."
    - content: "Use the `in` operator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use the `is` operator."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `is` operator determines whether two objects are the same object.  That behavior doesn't help in this case."
    - content: "Use the `contains()` helper function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no helper function named `contains()` for lists."
