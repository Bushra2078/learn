The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```python
first_value = '  FIRST challenge         '
second_value = '-  second challenge  -'
third_value = 'tH IR D-C HALLE NGE'

fourth_value = 'fourth'
fifth_value = 'fifth'
sixth_value = 'sixth'

# First challenge
first_value = first_value.strip()
first_value = first_value.lower()
first_value = first_value.title()
first_value = f'{first_value:^30}'

# Second challenge
second_value = second_value.replace('-', '')
second_value = second_value.strip()
second_value = second_value.capitalize()

# Third challenge
third_value = third_value.replace(' ', '')
third_value = third_value.replace('-', ' ')
third_value = third_value.swapcase()
third_value = f'{third_value:>30}'

print(first_value)
print(second_value)
print(third_value)

# Fourth challenge - use only the print() function (no f-strings)
print(fourth_value, fifth_value, sixth_value, sep='#', end='!')

# Fifth challenge - use only a single print() function.  Create tabs and new lines using f-strings.
print(f'\t{fourth_value}\n\t{fifth_value}\n\t{sixth_value}')
```

If your code produces the following output, then you were successful.

```output
       First Challenge        
Second challenge
               Third challenge
fourth#fifth#sixth!
        fourth
        fifth
        sixth
```

Whether or not you used the solution shown here, as long as you got the desired output, you were successful. Now you can continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
