  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You want to find the next index of either the `-` char, the `=` char, or the `_` char.  Which method should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "IndexOfAny()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  Use `IndexOfAny()` when you need to retrieve the next index for any of several chars in a string."
    - content: "Remove()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `Remove()` method won't help you find an index."
    - content: "IndexOf()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `IndexOf()` could be used to find the position of a single char in a string.  However, in this case we want to find any of several chars."
    - content: "Replace()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `Replace()` method won't help you find an index."
  - content: "What is a constant variable?"
    choices:
    - content: "A magic string or number."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A constant might be used to replace a magic string or number, but they aren't the same thing."
    - content: "A variable whose name must match its value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A constant's value is not constrained by its name."
    - content: "A variable that can only be used in the scope of the method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While a constant's scope is the same as any local variable, that isn't the purpose of a constant."
    - content: "A value that once initialized can never be changed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
