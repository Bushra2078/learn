Python strings are one of the most common types used in the language. In this module, you learned about some of its string properties and the most common methods for manipulating them. Finally, you saw ways to format strings by using three different techniques:

- Using the `%` formatter.
- Using `.format()` in a string.
- Using f-strings.

This foundational knowledge will help you with other data structures in Python that work well with strings, such as dictionaries and lists.
