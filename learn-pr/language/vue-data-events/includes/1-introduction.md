Users typically modify data in a web application by using a form. Because Vue.js is about working with dynamic data, it has a robust mechanism for binding data to forms. You can also manage events, performing different operations when a user selects a button or otherwise interacts with the page. And you can even add values that are computed dynamically, allowing you to minimize the amount of repeated code.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Bind model data to a form.
- Add event handlers.
- Create computed values.
