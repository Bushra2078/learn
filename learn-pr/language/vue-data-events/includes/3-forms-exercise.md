Here you'll update a fictitious application that allows users to book cruises into space. You'll add a form to allow someone to book a trip to the moon.

## Clone the starter repository and explore the code

This module has an associated starter repository. This starter allows you to focus on only the concepts in this module. 

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/?azure-portal=true) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?azure-portal=true) installed. In Visual Studio Code, you'll need the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&azure-portal=true) extension.

Clone the starter repository and open the folder in Visual Studio Code by running the following code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-vue-data-events
cd mslearn-vue-data-events/start
code .
```

The starter application already contains the core data model you'll use. The `product` has information about the cruise itself, including the list of available `cabins`. You'll use the `booking` object to store the options the user selects for the reservation. You can see the setup in the *index.js* file.

## Create the form

Create the form the user will use to set up the reservation:

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the *index.html* file.
1. Below the `TODO: Add booking form` comment, add the following HTML.

    ```html
    <!-- TODO: Add booking form -->
    <form v-show="!booking.completed">
        <h2>Book now!</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <label for="product-cabin">Select class:</label>
            <select id="product-cabin" v-model="booking.cabinIndex">
                <option v-for="(cabin, index) in product.cabins" :value="index">
                    {{ cabin.name }} $ {{ cabin.price.toLocaleString('en-US') }}
                </option>
            </select>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <label for="notes">Notes:</label>
            <textarea v-model="booking.notes" rows="3"></textarea>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <!--TODO: Add button later -->


        </div>
    </form>
    ```

## Break down the code

Let's explore the HTML code you added to the page.

### The form element

```html
<form v-show="!booking.completed">
```

The `form` element is a normal HTML form element. The key attribute you added is `v-show`, which allows you to toggle the display of an item in Vue.js. In this design, you want to display the item if the booking is incomplete. We can calculate this by using `!booking.completed`, with the `!` reversing the `completed` option for us.

### The select element for cabins

```html
<select id="product-cabin" v-model="booking.cabinIndex">
    <option v-for="(cabin, index) in product.cabins" :value="index">
        {{ cabin.name }} $ {{ cabin.price.toLocaleString('en-US') }}
    </option>
</select>
```

You display the list of available cabins by using a `select` element. You want to bind the selected value, which will be the index, to `booking.cabinIndex`. 

The list of available cabins is in `product.cabins`, so you use `v-for` to create the list of options for the drop-down list. You set the `value` of each option to the `index`. And you create a display of the `name` of the cabin and its `price`.

### The text area element for notes

```html
<textarea v-model="booking.notes" rows="3"></textarea>
```

You bind the `booking.notes` option to a `textarea`. You set the size by setting the `rows` attribute to *3*.

### The todo comment

Notice that you've added a `TODO` reminder to add a button. After you learn to create event handlers later in this module, you'll place the button here.

> [!TIP]
> `TODO` comments are a great way to make notes about tasks you need to complete.

## Test the results

Let's see your updated page!

1. Save all files by selecting **File** > **Save all**.
1. Open the command pallet by selecting Ctrl+Shift+P. On a Mac, select Cmd+Shift+P. 
1. Ensure Live Server is running by typing *Live Server* and then selecting *Live Server: Open with Live Server*.
1. In a browser, go to `http://localhost:5500`.

You see that the page displays the following image:

You have now bound Vue data to a form.
