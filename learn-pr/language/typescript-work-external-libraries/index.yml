title: 'Implement interfaces in TypeScript'
summary: JavaScript doesn't support interfaces so, as a JavaScript developer, you may or may not have experience with them. In TypeScript, you can use interfaces as you would in traditional object-oriented programming. You can also use interfaces to define object types and this is the primary focus of this module.
