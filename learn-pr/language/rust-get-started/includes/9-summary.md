In this module, you learned:

- The types of applications you can build by using Rust.
- Rust is useful for both low-level and high-level types of development.
- The `rustup` command is used to set up a development environment in Rust.
- The `rustc` command is used to write and compile Rust programs.
- You use Cargo to start a new project template, and build and run it.

In the next module in this learning path, you'll walk through some common programming concepts in Rust, including functions, data types, and control flow.
