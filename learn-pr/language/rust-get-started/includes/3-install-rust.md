The recommended way to install Rust is to use `rustup`, the Rust Toolchain Installer. Go to the website [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs?azure-portal=true) to find the appropriate instructions for your operating system.

Copy the curl command by selecting the clipboard icon. Then open your computer's terminal or command prompt to paste the command, and follow the on-screen instructions.

Rust has a six-week, rapid release process, and supports a great number of platforms, so there are many builds of Rust available at any time. If you've installed `rustup` in the past, you can update your installation by running the command `rustup update`.

After you've completed the installation, you should have the `rustc` and `cargo` commands available. Type the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

    $ rustc --version
    rustc 1.47.0 (18bf6b4f0 2020-10-07)

    $ cargo --version
    cargo 1.47.0 (f3c7e066a 2020-08-28)

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest stable version that has been released. This information is in the following format:

`rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)`

If you see this, you have installed Rust successfully! If you don't see this information and you're on Windows, check that Rust is in your `%PATH%` system variable.
