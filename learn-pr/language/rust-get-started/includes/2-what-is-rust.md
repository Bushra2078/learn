Rust is an open-source, systems programming language that helps you write faster, more reliable software. Rust offers control over low-level details like memory usage in combination with high-level concepts like iteration and interfaces. These features reduce the hassle traditionally associated with low-level languages like C and C++.

Rust also offers the following advantages that make it a great fit for a wide range of applications:

- **Type safe:** The compiler assures that no operation will be applied to a variable of a wrong type.
- **Memory safe:** Rust pointers (known as *references*) always refer to valid memory.
- **Data race-free:** Rust's borrow checker guarantees thread-safety by ensuring that multiple parts of a program can't mutate the same value at the same time.
- **Zero cost abstractions:** Rust allows the use of high-level concepts, like iteration, interfaces, and functional programming, with minimal to no performance costs. The abstractions perform as well, as if you wrote the underlying code by hand.
- **Minimal runtime:** Rust has a very minimal and optional runtime. The language also has no garbage collector to manage memory efficiently. In this way Rust is most similar to languages like C and C++.
- **Targets bare-metal:** Rust can target embedded and "bare metal" programming, making it suitable to write an operating system kernel or device drivers.


According to the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey?azure-portal=true) of 2020, Rust has been the most loved language for several years in a row. Developers enjoy programming with Rust! Hundreds of companies, from startups to large enterprises, are using Rust in production for their unique use cases. From building tools, to writing web apps, working on servers, and creating embedded devices, the possibilities are limitless.
