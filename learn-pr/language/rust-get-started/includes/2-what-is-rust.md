Rust is an open-source, systems programming language that helps you write faster, more reliable software. Rust offers control over low-level details (such as memory usage) in combination with high-level concepts (such as iteration and interfaces). These features reduce the hassle traditionally associated with low-level languages.

Rust might be the only language that "ticks all the boxes" you're looking for:

- **Type safe:** The compiler assures that no operation will be applied to a variable of a wrong type.
- **Memory safe:** Rust pointers (known as *references*) always refer to valid memory.
- **Data race-free:** Rust's borrow checker guarantees thread-safety by ensuring that multiple parts of a program can't mutate the same value at the same time.
- **Zero cost abstractions:** Rust allows the use of high-level concepts, like iteration, interfaces, and functional programming, without any performance costs. The abstractions perform just as well as if you had written the underlying code by hand.
- **Minimal runtime:** Rust has a very minimal runtime, with no setup required. The language also has no garbage collector, in order to manage memory efficiently.
- **Targets bare-metal:** Rust can target embedded and low-level programming, making it suitable to write an operating system kernel or device drivers.

Rust's ensures that your program is free of null pointer dereferences, double frees, dangling pointers, and similar bugs, all at compile time, without runtime overhead. In multi-threaded code, Rust catches data races at compile time, making concurrency much easier to use.

According to the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey?azure-portal=true) of 2020, Rust has been the most loved language for several years in a row.
