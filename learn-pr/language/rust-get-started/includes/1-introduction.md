With the Rust programming language, you can build reliable and efficient systems software, like networking software (such as web servers, mails servers, and web browsers) and systems software (such as compilers and interpreters, virtualization and software containers, databases, operating systems, and cryptography). You can also build games, media processing programs, command-line programs, web assembly programs, and applications meant for embedded devices.

Rust is a safe alternative to existing systems software languages like C and C++. Like C and C++, Rust does *not* have a large runtime or garbage collector which contrasts it with almost all other modern languages. However, unlike C and C++, Rust guarantees memory safety meaning many of the bugs related to incorrect use of memory you encounter in those languages are prevented by Rust. 

Rust strikes a unique balance among performance, safety, and expressivity. No matter what your programming background, you'll like find Rust has something to offer!

## What's the best way to learn Rust?

Rust requires a bit of theoretical knowledge before being able to productively write Rust code on your own. Make sure to follow along with this course and/or other Rust learning resources before going off on your own. Once you reach a basic understanding of the language, you'll want to practice writing code as much as possible. Type along with the exercises in this module and the others in this learning path.

We'll begin by learning small, foundational concepts, which we'll then build on with continual
practice and exploration. You'll build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you'll have a
solid grasp of the language.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Set up your development environment for using Rust.
- Write a simple "Hello, world!" program.
- Use Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
- Knowledge of how to download programs from the internet
