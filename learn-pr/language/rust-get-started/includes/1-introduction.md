With the Rust programming language, you can build reliable and efficient software, like network programming (such as web servers, mails servers, and web browsers) and systems programming (such as compilers and interpreters, virtualization and software containers, databases, operating systems, and cryptography). You can also build games, media processing, command-line programs, web assembly, and embedded programming.

## What's the best way to learn Rust?

Practice writing code as much as possible. Type along with the exercises in this module and the others in this learning path.

Additionally, begin by learning small, foundational concepts, and build on these with continual
practice and exploration. You'll build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you'll have a
solid grasp of the language.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Set up your development environment for using Rust.
- Write a simple "Hello, world!" program.
- Use Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
- Knowledge of how to download programs from the internet
