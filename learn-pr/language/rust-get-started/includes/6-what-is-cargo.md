While the `rustc` compiler is fine for simple programs, as your project grows, youâ€™ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your code.

The good news is that when you install `rustup`, you'll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager. This is called Cargo.

Cargo does lots of things for you, including:

- Creating new project templates with `cargo new`.
- Building your project with `cargo build`.
- Running your project with `cargo run`.
- Testing your project with `cargo test`.
- Building documentation for your project with `cargo doc`.
- Publishing a library to crates.io with `cargo publish`.

In the next unit, you'll rewrite your "Hello, world!" program by using Cargo.
