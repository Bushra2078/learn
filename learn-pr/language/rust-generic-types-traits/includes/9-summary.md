In this module, you learned:

- How Rust deals with polymorphism by using traits and generic types.
- How to write generic functions by using trait bounds.
- How to implement the Iterator trait for a custom type.

In the next module of this learning path, you'll explore different ways of organizing your code among files, modules, and crates.
