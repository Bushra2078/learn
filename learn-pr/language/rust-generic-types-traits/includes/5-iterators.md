We've already covered how we can iterate over collection types by using the loop. This time, we'll do a more in-depth review on how Rust handles the concept of iteration itself.

In Rust, all iterators implement a trait named `Iterator` that's defined in the standard library and is used to implement iterators over collections such as ranges, arrays, vectors, and hash maps.

The core of that trait looks like this:

```rust
trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

An `Iterator` has a method, `next`, which when called returns an `Option<Item>`. The `next` method will return `Some(Item)` as long as there are elements. After they've all been exhausted, it will return `None` to indicate that iteration is finished.

Notice this definition uses some new syntax: `type Item` and `Self::Item`, which define an
associated type with this trait. This definition means that every implementation of the `Iterator` traits also requires the definition of the associated `Item` type, which is used as the return type of the `next` method. In other words, the `Item` type will be the type returned from the iterator inside the `for` loop block.

## Implement our own iterator

Creating an iterator of your own involves two steps:

1. You create a struct to hold the iterator's state.
2. You implement the iterator for that struct.

Let's make an iterator named `Counter`, which counts from one to an arbitrary number, that's defined when the `Counter` struct is created.

First, we create the struct that will hold our iterator state. We also implement a `new` method to control how it should be initiated.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Counter {
    length: usize,
    count: usize,
}

impl Counter {
    fn new(length: usize) -> Counter {
	    Counter {
	        count: 0,
	        length,
	    }
    }
}
```

Then, we implement the `Iterator` trait for our `Counter` struct. We'll be counting with usize, so we declare that our associated `Item` type should be of that type.

The `next()` method is the only required method that we should define. Inside its body, we increment our
count by one at every call *(which is why we started at zero)*. Then we check to see if we've finished counting or not. We use the `Some(value)` variant of the `Option` type to express that iteration is still yielding results and the `None` variant to express that iteration should stop.

```rust
impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = usize;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
    
        self.count += 1;
        if self.count <= self.length {
            Some(self.count)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```

We can check that our `Counter` works by explicitly calling its `next` function.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = Counter::new(6);
    println!("Counter just created: {:#?}", counter);

    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(1));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(2));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(3));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(4));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(5));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(6));
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), None);
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), None);  // further calls to `next` will return `None`
    assert_eq!(counter.next(), None);

    println!("Counter exhausted: {:#?}", counter);
}

```

But calling `next` this way gets repetitive. Rust allows us to use `for` loops in types that implement the `Iterator` trait, so let's do that:

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in Counter::new(10) {
        println!("{}", number);
    }
}
```

The preceding snippet will then print the following output in the console:

```output
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
```

The `Iterator` trait's full definition includes other methods too, but they are default methods. They're built on top of `next`, so you get them for free:

```rust
let sum_until_10: usize = Counter::new(10).sum();
assert_eq!(sum_until_10, 55);

let powers_of_2: Vec<usize> = Counter::new(8).map(|n| 2usize.pow(n as u32)).collect();
assert_eq!(powers_of_2, vec![2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]);
```
