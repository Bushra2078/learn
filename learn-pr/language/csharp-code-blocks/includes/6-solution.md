The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit:

```csharp-interactive
int[] numbers = { 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 };
int total = 0;
bool found = false;

foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    total += number;
    if (number == 42) found = true;
}

if (found) Console.WriteLine("Set contains 42");

Console.WriteLine($"Total: {total}");
```

This code is merely *one possible solution*, because you may have added line feeds in different spots, and you may have formatted the code differently.  

The biggest changes to the problematic code included:

- Moving the `total` and `found` variables outside of the `foreach` statement
- Initializing both the `total` and `found` variables with sensible default values
- Removing the code blocks and extra line feeds from the `if` statements

No matter how you formatted the code, when you it, you should get the following output:

```output
Set contains 42
Total: 108
```

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
