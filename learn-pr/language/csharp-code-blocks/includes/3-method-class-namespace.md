Up until now, if you've followed the learning path on Microsoft Learn, we've only used code blocks to define the `if-elseif-else` and `foreach` statements. We'll continue to use them as we learn more decision and iteration statements, but code blocks are also critical to defining higher-level structures for our code.

## Code blocks define methods, classes, and namespaces

In these modules featuring beginner C# units, we'll use the .NET Editor to compose and run applications. While the .NET Editor is a great feature that eliminates your need to install a development environment like Visual Studio Code or the full Visual Studio IDE, it doesn't allow you to build real applications.

If you were to create a new C# Console Application project in either Visual Studio Code (via the `dotnet` command-line interface, or CLI) or the full Visual Studio IDE, a name file named `Program.cs` is generated that contains code from a template. Here's the generated code from an application named `MyNewApp`:

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyNewApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Our in-browser C# editor, the .NET Editor, cannot run the code in this unit. If you attempt to run this code, you will see compilation errors.

Here you have three levels of code blocks, starting from the inner-most code block and working our way outward:

- a method `Main()`
- a class `Program`
- a namespace `MyNewApp`

As you build real applications, you'll write *methods* and organize them into *classes* and *namespaces*.

A **method** is a code block that is a unit of execution. In other words, once the method is called by its name, the entire method will execute until:

- the runtime encounters the `return` keyword, or
- the runtime encounters an exception and can't continue, or
- the runtime successfully executes each line of code in the method.

In the browser-based .NET editor, all the code you write is executed inside of a hidden `Main()` method, which hopefully has reduced a lot of complexity as you're getting started.

The method's name, `Main()`, is special. When the program is executed, the .NET Runtime will search by default for a method named `Main()` to use as the starting point, or entry point, for the program.

A **class** is a container for members like methods, properties, events, fields, and so on. In the [Call methods from the .NET Class Library using C#](/learn/modules/csharp-call-methods/) module, you learned that you must create an instance of a class using the `new` keyword if you want to call a method that requires state (or rather, instance methods). Otherwise, you can call methods that are not stateful without first creating an instance of the class (or rather, static methods).

A **namespace** disambiguates class names. In the [Call methods from the .NET Class Library using C#](/learn/modules/csharp-call-methods/) module, you learned how there are so many classes in the .NET Class Library that it's possible to have two classes with the same name. The namespace ensures you can instruct the compiler with which class and method you want to work by also specifying a namespace.

When you create a new project using the `dotnet` CLI or the full Visual Studio IDE, it will automatically create a namespace using the project's name. That's why the default namespace in the preceding code example is `MyNewApp`. You can create additional namespaces in your code as needed, and can create a hierarchical series of namespaces by using the dot operator. So, suppose we wanted to create a second level of namespaces for the classes of our application. We could add a child-namespace like so:

```csharp
namespace MyNewApp.Business
{
  // Classes here    
}
```

And perhaps another child-namespace like so:

```csharp
namespace MyNewApp.Data
{
  // Classes here    
}
```

In the `MyNewApp.Business` namespace, we would expect to add classes that implemented the business logic of our application. In the `MyNewApp.Data` namespace, we would expect to add classes that implemented the data-access features of our application. We can add as many namespaces as we want, and we can create namespaces as many levels deep as we need; we'd just keep appending child-namespace names using the dot operator.

Most importantly for the purposes of this module, code blocks define the boundaries for each of these constructs. Code blocks suggest an ownership-or containment-relationship, so the rules we just learned about variable scope and access are true at this level as well.

### Calling a method in the same class

The following code example calls a method named `Reverse()` that is defined in the same class.

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyNewApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string value = "Microsoft Learn";
            string reversedValue = Reverse(value);
            Console.WriteLine($"Secret message: {reversedValue}");
        }

        static string Reverse(string message)
        {
            char[] letters = message.ToCharArray();
            Array.Reverse(letters);
            return new string(letters);
        }
    }
}
```

Let's focus on the line of code that calls the `Reverse()` method:

```csharp
string reversedValue = Reverse(value);
```

Since the `Reverse()` method is defined in the same class, the code that calls the method doesn't need to qualify the method's name with the class name.

### Calling a method from a different class

What if we move the `Reverse()` method into its own class? Consider the following code example:

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyNewApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string value = "Microsoft Learn";
            string reversedValue = Utility.Reverse(value);
            Console.WriteLine($"Secret message: {reversedValue}");
        }
    }

    class Utility
    {
        public static string Reverse(string message)
        {
            char[] letters = message.ToCharArray();
            Array.Reverse(letters);
            return new string(letters);
        }
    }
}
```

First, focus on these lines of code:

```csharp
    class Utility
    {
        public static string Reverse(string message)
        {
```

Here, we define the Utility class and add the `Reverse()` method. We also add the `public` keyword. Otherwise, it would be inaccessible to the `Program` class' `Main()` method. Without the `public` keyword, we would get the following compilation error:

```output
'Utility.Reverse(string)' is inaccessible due to its protection level
```

We'll talk about accessibility modifiers like `public` and `private` in other modules.

Next, focus on how we needed to use the new `Utility` class' name when accessing the `Reverse()` method from the `Main()` method.

```csharp
string reversedValue = Utility.Reverse(value);
```

Since the method no longer "lives" in the same class, to call the `Reverse()` method, we have to access it via the class into which it was moved.

### Referencing a class in a different namespace

What if we move the Utility class into a different namespace? How will this affect the accessibility of the class and its method?  Consider the following code example:

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyNewApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string value = "Microsoft Learn";
            string reversedValue = MyNewApp.Utilities.Utility.Reverse(value);
            Console.WriteLine($"Secret message: {reversedValue}");
        }
    }
}

namespace MyNewApp.Utilities
{
    class Utility
    {
        public static string Reverse(string message)
        {
            char[] letters = message.ToCharArray();
            Array.Reverse(letters);
            return new string(letters);
        }
    }
}
```

First, focus on the new namespace we added:

```csharp
namespace MyNewApp.Utilities
```

Not only did we create a new namespace `MyNewApp.Utilities`, but we also moved our `Utility` class and its contents into the new namespace.

Second, focus on how we called the `Reverse()` method:

```csharp
string reversedValue = MyNewApp.Utilities.Utility.Reverse(value);
```

Notice that we used the "full name" of the class, including its full namespace.

Since the child-namespace `Utilities` and the `Program` class are both defined in the `MyNewApp` parent namespace, we could avoid using the namespace in this instance, as illustrated in the following code:

```csharp
string reversedValue = Utilities.Utility.Reverse(value);
```

Even though it's less verbose, many would consider this hard to read because we typically don't separate parent and child namespaces like this. Consider keeping the full namespace together whenever it's needed to promote clarity and readability.

### The using statement helps the compiler resolve namespaces, but with fewer keystrokes

A better option would be to add a `using` statement. The `using` statement is added to the top of a code file, and it resolves the class names that are used in the file, instructing the compiler to look at the list of namespaces to find all of the class names.

Here's another version of the application that adds a using statement to simplify the call to the `Reverse()` method:

```csharp
using System;
using MyNewApp.Utilities;

namespace MyNewApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string value = "Microsoft Learn";
            string reversedValue = Utility.Reverse(value);
            Console.WriteLine($"Secret message: {reversedValue}");
        }
    }
}

namespace MyNewApp.Utilities
{
    class Utility
    {
        public static string Reverse(string message)
        {
            char[] letters = message.ToCharArray();
            Array.Reverse(letters);
            return new string(letters);
        }
    }
}
```

Focus on this line of code, added on the second line:

```csharp
using MyNewApp.Utilities;
```

The `using` statement tells the compiler to look here when attempting to resolve any class names it needs to find. Now, we can call the `Reverse()` method using only the class name like so:

```csharp
string reversedValue = Utility.Reverse(value);
```

This is also why the template that generates the `Program.cs` file includes this line of code at the top:

```csharp
using System;
```

This makes it possible to call `Console.WriteLine()` instead of `System.Console.WriteLine()`.

### What does this have to do with code blocks?

Code blocks define the boundaries of higher-level structures like namespaces, classes, and methods, just as they define the boundaries of decision and iteration statements. These boundaries require consideration because they affect the visibility of both variables and other larger structures like methods and classes. In some cases, additional keywords like `public` and `using` must be used to pass into the boundaries of another block of code. In other cases, structures defined as siblings inside the same code block can reference each other freely.

## Recap

- Code blocks define higher-level structures like namespaces, classes, and methods.  
- Just as code blocks affect the visibility of variables defined inside of lower-level structures like decision and iteration statements, code blocks also affect the visibility of methods between classes and classes between namespaces.
- You can add the `using` statement to code files to instruct the compiler where to look for references to classes.
