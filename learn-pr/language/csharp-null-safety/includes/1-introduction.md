In this module, you'll gain an understanding of nullability in C#. You'll use null state analysis and compiler warnings to check code for null safety.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to maintain an existing .NET console app that's part of the order system. You've decided to enforce null safety in the app using nullable reference types.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to configure the nullable context of your C# project or code.
- Use a nullable enabled context to perform automatic static flow analysis.
- Understand the different ways in which you can declare nullable types.
- Learn how and when to use various null-related C# operators:
  - null-forgiving (`!`) operator
  - null-coalescing (`??`) operator
  - null-conditional (`?.`) operator

## Prerequisites

- Experience writing C# at the beginner level
- Visual Studio Code
- .NET SDK 6.0 or greater
- Git command-line client

## Get started

In the next unit, you'll learn about nullability and null safety in C#.
