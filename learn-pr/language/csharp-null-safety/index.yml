# NOTES
# Null Safety in C#

# Since we turned on nullable in all project templates in .NET 6 we need
# to create educational content on what null safety is, why use it,
# and how it impacts projects and code. 
#
# Microsoft Learn Module: Null Safety in .NET & C#
#
# Introduction
# Learn: What is Null & Null Safety?
#     “Here is null and here are the types that can be null”
#     How can reference types be null
#     What is Nullable<T>
#     Why does null matter -> Null reference exception
#     What is null safety
#     Why does null safety matter
#     <nullable> setting
# Exercise: Nullable reference types
#     File -> new console app
#     Explore the <nullable> add a class, see warnings, etc for reference types
# Learn: Checking for null
# Exercise: Checking for null
# Learn: Null-coalescing
# Exercise: Null-coalescing
# Summary

# Bill's brain:
# string vs string? "Tony Hoare"

# "The compiler will let you know when you might be de-referencing null"

# start with locals
# then params, ah ha... do we cover attributes
# variable = might be null or definitely not null`
