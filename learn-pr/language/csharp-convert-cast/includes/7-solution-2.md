The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```csharp-interactive
int value1 = 12;
decimal value2 = 6.2m;
float value3 = 4.3f;

int result1 = Convert.ToInt32((decimal)value1 / value2);
Console.WriteLine($"Divide value1 by value2, display the result as an int: {result1}");

decimal result2 = value2 / (decimal)value3;
Console.WriteLine($"Divide value2 by value3, display the result as a decimal: {result2}");

float result3 = value3 / value1;
Console.WriteLine($"Divide value3 by value1, display the result as a float: {result3}");
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because there's likely several ways to solve this challenge. The proposed solution (above) relies on casting alone; however, it's possible you have another approach that works equally well. Just make sure your result matches the following output:

```output
Divide value1 by value2, display the result as an int: 2
Divide value2 by value3, display the result as a decimal: 1.4418604651162790697674418605
Divide value3 by value1, display the result as a float: 0.3583333
```

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
