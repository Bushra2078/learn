Here's a second chance to use what you've learned about casting and conversion to solve a coding challenge.

## Second challenge

The following challenge will force you to understand the implications of casting values considering the impact of narrowing and widening conversions.

### Step 1: Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor then select the `del` or `backspace` key to delete it.

### Step 2: Write code in the .NET Editor to produce the desired output

Start with the following code:

```csharp-interactive
int value1 = 12;
decimal value2 = 6.2m;
float value3 = 4.3f;

// Your code here to set result1
Console.WriteLine($"Divide value1 by value2, display the result as an int: {result1}");

// Your code here to set result2
Console.WriteLine($"Divide value2 by value3, display the result as a decimal: {result2}");

// Your code here to set result3
Console.WriteLine($"Divide value3 by value1, display the result as a float: {result3}");
```

Replace the code comments with your own code to solve the challenge.

When you run your code, you should get the following output:

```output
Divide value1 by value2, display the result as an int: 2
Divide value2 by value3, display the result as a decimal: 1.4418604651162790697674418605
Divide value3 by value1, display the result as a float: 0.3583333
```
