  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You need to change a `string` value `4.123456789` into a `decimal`.  Which technique should you **avoid**?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Convert.ToDecimal()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using `ToDecimal` is a valid technique to use."
    - content: "`decimal.TryParse()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using `TryParse` is a valid technique to use."
    - content: "`(decimal)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  You can't cast a string into a decimal."
  - content: "You need to change a `float` into an `int`.  How would you describe this action?"
    choices:
    - content: "This is a narrowing conversion."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "This is a widening conversion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Changing a `float` into an `int` isn't a widening conversion because `float` can store more precision data than `int`."
    - content: "This is an illegal conversion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Changing a `float` into an `int` isn't an illegal conversion.  You can accomplish this (albeit, with the loss of precision data)."
    - content: "This is a parsing conversion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no such thing as a 'parsing conversion'."
