## Setup a new .NET project

1. Open a terminal window.

1. Create a new .NET console application by running this command:

    ```bash
    dotnet new console -n ManipulateData
    ```

1. Go to your files by running this command: 

    ```bash
    cd ManipulateData
    ```
    
    You should now have access to these files:
    ```bash
    -| bin
    -| obj
    -| ManipulateData.csproj
    -| Program.cs
    ```

1. Run the application by typing this command in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    You should see this output:

    ```output
    Hello World
    ```
