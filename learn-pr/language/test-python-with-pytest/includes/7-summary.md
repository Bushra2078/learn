In this module, we covered the basics of using Pytest, one of the most popular testing frameworks for Python. First, we covered some basics about writing tests for Pytest followed by examples of running the Pytest command-line tool. Then, you read about test classes and methods, which offer different flexibility from test functions.

Finally, you tried building tests for a function, which had an issue. The tests allowed you to figure out the problem, and make some fixes.

You should now feel comfortable looking at tests written for Pytest. With either test functions or classes, you should feel ready to write new tests or extend an existing test suite for Pytest.
