Our goal was to create a development environment to begin writing Python code.

You installed Python version 3, Visual Studio Code, and the Python extension for Visual Studio Code. You also created your first application.

You've taken your first steps toward learning Python. Soon you'll be writing programs and scripts to analyze data, run websites, and many other applications.
