Our goal was to create a development environment to begin writing Python code.

We installed Python version 3, Visual Studio Code, and the Python extension for Visual Studio Code. We started interactive mode, wrote Python, and ran code one line at a time. 

You've taken your first steps toward learning how to use Python to build programs and write scripts to automate tasks, analyze data, and build entire web-based applications, games, and more.
