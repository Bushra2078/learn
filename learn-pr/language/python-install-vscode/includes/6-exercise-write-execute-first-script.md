Now that you have Visual Studio Code installed, you'll install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code and, optionally, set up other tools and settings.

## Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a great lightweight general-purpose code editor.  Extensions provide additional functionality for only the programming languages or features that you want to enable. The Python extension for Visual Studio Code provides visual cues and tools to help you write better Python code, and to write code faster.

### Step 1 - Open Extensions view

You can browse through extensions and install them from within Visual Studio Code. 

Bring up the Extensions view. Go to **View** and select **Extensions**, or select the **Extensions** icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of Visual Studio Code.

Extensions view will display a list of the Visual Studio Code extensions that are the most popular on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

### Step 2 - Search for the Python extension

To filter the list of extensions, enter **python** in the search box at the top of the Extensions view.

Select the extension that's published by Microsoft (usually the first one in the list). The details about that extension will appear in a tab in the main area to the right.

### Step 3 - Install the Python extension

In the main area, where you see the details about the Python extension, select **Install**.

When the installation is complete, the button's text will change to **Uninstall**. This lets you know that you've successfully installed the Python extension.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="linux"

### Step 3 - Install the Python extension

In the main area, where you see the details about the Python extension, select **Install**.

When the installation is complete, the button's text will change to **Uninstall**. This lets you know that you've successfully installed the Python extension.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="macos"

### Step 3 - Install the Python extension

In the main area, where you see the details about the Python extension, select **Install**.

When the installation is complete, the button's text will change to **Uninstall**.  This lets you know that you've successfully installed the Python extension.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you install the Python extension, you might see a dialog box that asks you whether you want to install the command-line developer tools. You should select **Install**. You'll need to agree to the Command Line Tools License Agreement. The installation process could take as long as 20 minutes or more, depending on your internet connection. After the installation is done, you'll see a dialog box stating that the software is installed. You can select **Done** to proceed.

::: zone-end


### Step 4 - Address pop-up messages

When working with `.py` files which you will use to write Python code, you might see several pop-up messages.  The most critical of these messages is this one: 

"No Python interpreter is selected.  You need to select a Python interpreter to enable features such as IntelliSense, linting, and debugging."

If you click **Select Python Interpreter**, you'll see a list of Python interpreters near the top of Visual Studio Code, in the command bar.  Select the most recent version that you have installed, making sure that it's version 3 or later.

Your selection will be reflected in the Visual Studio Code status bar, near the lower-left corner.

Alternatively, you might see this message: 

"Tip: you can change the Python interpreter used by the Python extension by clicking on the Python version in the status bar."

This message just lets you know you have an interpreter selected, but you can change it if you want. You can change it by clicking the currently selected interpreter near the lower-left corner and then choosing from the list of Python interpreters displayed near the top of Visual Studio Code in the command bar.

Select **Got it!** to dismiss the tip, or select **Do not show again** to permanently disable it.

After you've addressed all the pop-up messages, you've successfully set up the Python extension for Visual Studio Code and are ready to begin writing Python code!
