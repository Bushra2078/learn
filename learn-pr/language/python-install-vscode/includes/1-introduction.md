The first step to working with any programming language is to obtain the necessary tools. While you could write Python applications in a basic text editor, using a code editor such as Visual Studio Code is the preferred method. Visual Studio Code and similar editors can highlight syntax errors and offer autocomplete. You'll also have access to a rich set of add-ons to further enhance your development experience.

In this module, you'll build your Python development environment, the environment you'll use to both learn Python and build many applications. You'll also learn how to use Visual Studio Code to create and run a Python file.

By the end of this module, you'll have installed the tools on your computer to move forward with your goal of building applications with Python.

## Objectives
