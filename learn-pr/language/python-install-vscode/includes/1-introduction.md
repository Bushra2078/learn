The first step to working with any programming language is to set up the necessary tools. Most developers use a code editor like Visual Studio Code, because these tools provide autocomplete for code and highlight syntax errors. Code editors also provide access to a rich set of add-ons to further enhance your development experience.

In this module, you'll set up your Python development environment. You'll use this space to learn Python and build several applications. You'll also learn how to use Visual Studio Code to create and run a Python file.

By the end of this module, you'll have installed the tools required to move forward with your goal of building applications with Python.
