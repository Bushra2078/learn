## Install Python on Windows

When this module was written, Python 3.8 was the latest version of Python available, so we'll be referring to that version in the following instructions.

Also, these instructions are specifically for Windows 10. If you're using a previous version of Windows, the basic instructions are the same, though the process in some steps might be slightly different.

> [!NOTE]
> At the time of this writing, Python 3.8.0 was the most current version of Python, so we refer to that version in these instructions. You should install the latest version available. If you install a different version, the text on buttons and the file names that you see might be slightly different from the ones in these instructions.

### Step 1 - Download the Python 3.8 installer for Windows

Go to the
[Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/?azure-portal=true).

Select the **Download Python 3.*x*** button. When your browser prompts you to save the file, note the download path, and then save the file to your local hard drive.  Most web browsers save downloaded files into your Downloads folder.

### Step 2 - Locate and run the installer application

Depending on the web browser you use, you might have the option to run the file immediately after it downloads.  

If not, you can open File Explorer, go to the download path that you noted in the previous step, and then double-click the file. The file's name should be **python-3.8.0.exe**.

### Step 3 - Choose options and start the installation process

After the installer's dialog box appears, select **Add Python 3.8 to PATH**.

Next, take note of the installation path under **Install Now**.

If you're satisfied with the installation location, select **Install Now**.

If you want to change the installation path, select **Customize installation**.

The first page of options is called **Optional Features**. You don't need to change the default selections. Select **Next**.

The second page of options is called **Advanced Options**. Near the bottom of the page, you can change the installation path under **Customize install location**.

After you're satisfied with the path, select **Install**.

### Step 4 - Accept the installation

Next, you'll see the Windows User Account Control dialog box, which prompts you to allow the app to make changes to your device.

Select **Yes** to continue.

### Step 5 - Close the installer

Select **Close**.

### Step 6 - Check your installation

To confirm that Python 3 installed correctly, type the following command at a Command Prompt and then select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

```dos
py --version
```

You should see the word `Python` with a set of numbers separated by `.` characters. Here's an example of the output you might see:

```output
Python 3.8.0
```
As long as the first of the three numbers is `3`, congratulations! You successfully installed Python 3 on your Windows computer.

## Install Python on Linux

When this module was written, Python 3.8 was the latest version of Python available, so we'll be referring to that version in the following instructions.

As you're probably aware, different Linux distributions use different package managers. Most popular Linux distributions include either APT (an acronym for "Advanced Packaging Tool") or YUM (an acronym for "Yellowdog Updater, Modified").

We provide instructions for APT and YUM in this unit. If your distribution of Linux uses a different package manager, you might need to search for **\<your Linux distribution> install python 3**.

### Install by using APT

#### Step 1 - Open a Terminal window

Assuming you're running a Linux graphical user interface desktop environment, locate and open a terminal window by using the Terminal icon.

#### Step 2 - Update the APT package indexes

Run this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
The `apt-get update` command updates the list of packages (the package indexes) from the repositories and Personal Package Archives (PPAs) that it's aware of. This update enables `apt-get` to find the latest versions of the packages that you want to install and their dependencies.

The `sudo` command temporarily elevates your permissions to root, the most powerful level of the system. When you use `sudo`, you'll usually be asked for your user account's password.

`apt-get update` will display all the items it will update. It might prompt you to approve by entering `y` or `yes` and then selecting the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

#### Step 3 - Install Python 3

Enter the following command at a Bash prompt and then select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

`apt-get install` will locate the appropriate packages from the package index, download the necessary files, and install the files into the appropriate folders.

#### Step 4 - Check your installation

To confirm that Python 3 installed correctly, enter the following command at a Bash prompt and then select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the word `Python` with a set of numbers separated by `.` characters. Here's an example of the output you might see:

```output
Python 3.6.7
```
As long as the first number is `3`, Python 3 installed successfully.

If the installation failed, you might see an error message. Enter the exact error message into a search engine's search box to find possible causes and solutions.

### Install by using YUM

The YUM package manager is used mainly by Red Hat systems, like Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, and by CentOS. If APT isn't installed on your system, you can try YUM instead. 

#### Step 1 - Open a Terminal window

Assuming you're running a Linux graphical user interface desktop environment, locate and open a terminal window by using the Terminal icon.

#### Step 2 - Update the YUM package indexes

Type the following command at a Bash prompt and then select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

```bash
sudo yum update
```
`yum update` will make sure all packages and their dependencies are up to date. It's a good idea to update the package list before you install new software.

#### Step 3 - Install Python 3

Type the following command at a Bash prompt and then select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

```bash
yum install rh-python36
```

#### Step 4 - Check your installation

To confirm that Python 3 installed correctly, type the following command at a Bash prompt and then select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the word `Python` with a set of numbers separated by `.` characters. Here's an example of the output you might see:

```output
Python 3.6.7
```
As long as the first number is `3`, Python 3 installed successfully.

If the installation failed, you might see an error message. If you do, continue to step 5.

#### Step 5 - (Optional) Enable the Software Collections feature in Bash

Software Collections allows you to install multiple versions of the same software components on your system. So you need to specify which version of Python you want to run in the shell. Enter the following command at a Bash prompt and then select the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key:

```bash
scl enable rh-python36 bash
```
Now retry step 4. The output should resemble this output:

```output
Python 3.6.7
```
As long as the first number is `3`, Python 3 installed successfully, in the context of a Software Collection.

`scl enable` starts a new Bash session, setting Python 3.6 as the default Python version. But Python 3.6 is the default version only for the current shell session. If you exit the session or open a new session from another terminal, Bash will revert to Python 2.7 as the default Python version.

For more information, see
[Red Hat Software Collections 2.4](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_software_collections/2/html/2.4_release_notes/chap-rhscl?azure-portal=true).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you needed to use `scl enable` to run `python3 --version`, you might need to enter that command every time you want to work in Python. There are workarounds, but this is the intended functionality of Software Collections.  See [Make a Red Hat Software Collection persist](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/527703?azure-portal=true) for a possible workaround.

## Install Python on macOS

Follow these steps to download the Python installer from the Python website.

> [!NOTE]
> At the time of this writing, Python 3.8.0 was the most current version, so we refer to that version in these instructions. You should install the latest version available. If you install a different version, the text on buttons and the file names that you see might be slightly different from the ones in these instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, you can use Homebrew to install Python and Visual Studio Code. For instructions, see the 
[Homebrew documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python?azure-portal=true).

### Step 1: Go to the Python download website and download the installer

Go to the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/?azure-portal=true).

The website should automatically direct you to a page specifically for Mac OS X. Select the **Download Python 3.8.0** button.

You might see a window prompting you to allow downloads from python.org. Select **Allow**.

After a moment, a file named python-3.8.0-mascosx10.9.pkg should download to the Downloads stack in your Dock.

### Step 2: Start the Python installer and accept options for a standard installation

Double-click the .pkg file that you downloaded to start the installer. The Python installer will prompt you to install, verify, and accept various options and license agreements. Take the time to read through these prompts to understand what the installer will do to your computer.

When the installation process finishes, a Finder window showing the contents of the Python folder will appear. You also should see a congratulations screen when the installation finishes. At that point you can select **Close**.

If you're prompted to move the Python installer to the trash, you can do so.

### Step 3: Check to ensure that Python 3 installed correctly

Using Spotlight (<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>), enter **terminal** and then select the <kbd>Return</kbd> key to launch Terminal.

At the Terminal prompt, enter the following command and then select the <kbd>Return</kbd> key:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the word `Python` with a set of numbers separated by `.` characters. Here's an example of the output you might see:

```output
Python 3.8.0
```
As long as the first number is `3`, Python 3 installed successfully.
