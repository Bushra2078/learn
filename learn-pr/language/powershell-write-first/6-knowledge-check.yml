  questions:
  - content: "How does PowerShell compile?"
    choices:
    - content: "You run a compiler as a step to output an executable program"
      isCorrect: false

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PowerShell isn't an interpreted language and doesn't get communicated to the computer as it runs"
    - content: "PowerShell doesn't compile at all and the computer knows what your code says automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PowerShell is compiled to something the computer can understand"
    - content: "PowerShell is compiled to an AST, checked for issues, then translated again so the computer can understand"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following statements is **true** about PowerShell."
    choices:

    - content: "`Prompt` is a cmdlet and `Read-Host` is a parameter"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "You can use double quotes and single quotes to create a string."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "If you make a mistake when writing code, you have to delete it all and start over."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, one of the great things about software development. If you make a mistake, you can fix it and no one has to know."
  - content: 'What is **wrong** with this line of code? `Read-host "What is wrong with this line of code?"`'
    choices:
    - content: "The `H` in `Read-host` should be lower-case."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `H` could be upper case, but it doesn't have to be."
    - content: "It's missing a semi-colon at the end"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PowerShell doesn't need semicolons to tell when a command is over."
    - content: "The string should use single-quotes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A string can be surrounded by either single or double-quotes."
    - content: "Nothing is wrong with this command. It will run normally."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! PowerShell's relaxed behavior allows this command to run normally."
