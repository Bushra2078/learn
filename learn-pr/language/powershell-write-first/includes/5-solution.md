The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```powershell
$date = Read-Host "What is today's date"
$name = Read-Host "Please enter your name"
Write-Output "Todays date is $date."
Write-Output "Today is the day $name began their PowerShell programming journey."
```

This code is only _one possible solution_. Your code could look different. However, you should
have used `Read-Host` and `Write-Output` to produce the desired output.

```output
Todays date is 02/05/2021.
Today is the day Chase began their PowerShell programming journey.
```

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
