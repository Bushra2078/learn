Code challenges throughout these modules reinforce what you've learned and help you gain confidence before you move on to the next lesson.

### Step 1: Close any open files in Cloud Shell code editor

Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> (<kbd>âŒ˜+Q</kbd> on macOS) to close any open files in the Cloud Shell code editor.

### Step 2: Create a new file to write your code

Create a new file named *GettingStarted.ps1*, and use the Cloud Shell code editor to open it.

### Step 3: Write code in Cloud Shell code editor to display two messages

Use the techniques you learned to print one message and then collect user input to reuse in a second message. In other words, you first learned how to display a message in just one line of code. You also learned how to request input from a user and then reuse that value to print a custom message. Use both techniques for this challenge.

No matter how you do it, your code should produce somethink like the following output. In this example, replace the placeholder text \<*current date*> and \<*your name*> with values that you choose.

```output
Today's date is <current date>.
Today is the day <your name> began their PowerShell programming journey.
```

### Step 4: Run the code

Close the code editor, and run the script in the Cloud Shell.
