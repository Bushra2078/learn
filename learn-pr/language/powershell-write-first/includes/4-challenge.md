Code challenges throughout these modules reinforce what you've learned and help you gain
confidence before moving on.

### Step 1: Close any open files in the Cloud Shell code editor

Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd> (<kbd>âŒ˜+q</kbd> on macOS) to close any open
files in the Cloud Shell code editor.

### Step 2: Create a new file to write your code

Create a new file named `GettingStarted.ps1` and use the Cloud Shell code editor to open it.

### Step 3: Write code in the Cloud Shell code editor to display two messages

Use the techniques you learned to print a message and take user input to reuse in a second message.
In other words, you learned how to display a message in just one line of code. You also learned how
to request input from a user, then reuse that value to print a custom message. Use both techniques
for this challenge.

No matter how you do it, your code should produce the following output. The `<text>` indicates a
custom value you need to replace.

```output
Todays date is <current date>.
Today is the day <your name> began their PowerShell programming journey.
```

### Step 4: Run the code

Close the code editor and run the script in the Cloud Shell.
