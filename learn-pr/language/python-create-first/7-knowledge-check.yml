  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: Which statement is false?
      choices:
        - content: All variables are of string data type by default.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: This is a false statement.  A variable can point to values in
            memory that are of many different data types.
        - content: The print() function can work with several data types, including
            string, int, float, and others.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is a true statement.
        - content: You use the same symbol for both addition and concatenation, and Python
            will understand which to perform based on the two values' data
            types.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is a true statement.
        - content: You must convert integer values to string values before performing
            string concatenation.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is a true statement.
    - content: You want to create a new variable to hold the count of items in
        inventory on hand.  Which of the following variable names would be your
        best choice?
      choices:
        - content: inventory_count_on_hand
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: While the variable name `inventory_count_on_hand` satisfies many
            aspects of Python's guidance on naming variables, there's a shorter
            option available that would likely suffice.
        - content: inventoryCountOnHand
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The Python naming convention suggests using all lowercase letters,
            separating each word with an underscore.  There's a better variable
            name choice you can make.
        - content: inventory_count
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: This two-word variable name adequately describes the value it is
            storing, and it uses the underscore character to separate the two
            words.
        - content: inv-ct
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This option uses odd contractions for the words 'inventory' and
            'count,' it uses a dash instead of an underscore, and it's difficult
            to read.  There's a better variable name choice you can make.
    - content: What is the purpose of the opening and closing parentheses next to a
        function name?
      choices:
        - content: They define the order of operations, as they do in math.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Although you'll soon learn that a set of parentheses can be used to
            define the order of operations, they do not serve this purpose when
            they're used next to a function name.
        - content: Parentheses are the function invocation operators that instruct Python
            to execute the function.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct!  Without parentheses, you're merely referencing the name
            of the function, not instructing Python what to do with it.
        - content: They instruct Python to return a value.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Calling a function can return a value, but this isn't the purpose
            of parentheses.
        - content: They instruct Python to display content to output.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The `print()` function displays content to output, and you can pass
            values to the function that you want to display between the
            parentheses. However, that's not their purpose.
