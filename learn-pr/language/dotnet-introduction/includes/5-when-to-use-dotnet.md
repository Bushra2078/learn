In this unit, we'll briefly discuss when you might want to use .NET.  When does it make sense to choose .NET?  What can you build with .NET?

## .NET is perfect for projects large and small

You may wonder if .NET is the right ecosystem to invest your time in learning. Millions of developers are using .NET every day to do amazing things since it gives them the tools to build the kinds of applications that matter to them.

### Choose .NET when productivity matters 

Once you learn how to build an application based on one app model, you can easily apply what you learned to building something else, even if it's for a different app model! For instance, once you learn how to build a web application, your .NET skills translate to building a mobile app. Repurposing your knowledge reduces the time and stress required to learn a new programming model or language, and for companies, it means saving time and expense as you ask developers to take on new challenges.

### Choose .NET for enterprise-scale applications

.NET is popular in enterprises due to its ecosystem, its integration with other Microsoft products including Azure cloud services and on-premise server products, and its strongly typed system that helps reduce the number of bugs that can arise in loosely typed systems. Developers can choose between an object-based paradigm in C# or a functional-based paradigm in F#, providing flexibility to choose the best language for the kinds of problems that enterprises try to solve.

### Choose .NET for prototype, start-up, and department-scale applications

.NET is also popular when used for smaller projects due to a long history of improvements to the design of the languages, APIs, and tools based on customer feedback and telemetry. New full-featured software can be developed quickly for prototyping purposes. Furthermore, .NET can run on inexpensive hardware and cloud services, and out-perform other popular platforms, which makes it a great fit for start-up businesses.

### Choose .NET for cloud and AI applications

The Azure SDK for .NET allows developers to provision and manage Azure resources. Alternatively, Azure App Service and Azure Functions can host applications built with .NET languages.

Furthermore, ML.NET is a free software machine learning library for .NET languages. It enables model-based Machine Learning analytic and prediction capabilities.

### Choose .NET to build IoT applications

.NET can be used to build IoT applications for IoT devices and scenarios. IoT applications typically interact with sensors, displays, and input devices that require the use of GPIO pins, serial ports, or similar hardware. For example, there are libraries available for working with popular boards like Raspberry Pi and Hummingboard.
