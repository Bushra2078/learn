If you're new to programming, understanding exactly what .NET is can be challenging.  It seems like the term .NET is applied to many things, but how are they related?  How do the various aspects of .NET work together to create a working application?

In this module, you will learn about .NET and its ecosystem.  You'll learn about both the technical aspects of the system and the role each part places to build software.  You'll learn about the ecosystem as a whole and the resources that are available.  You'll learn how .NET can be used to address many different software development needs.  And you'll write your first lines of C# code using a web based editor so that you can see how each part of .NET works together to create a .NET application.

By the end of this module, you will have started building a mental model of .NET. This mental model will prove vital as you take your next steps in building .NET applications.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe the major parts of .NET and its ecosystem.
- Write code in Try .NET and explain how the different parts of .NET come together to produce a running application.
- Choose when it makes sense to use .NET to build your applications.

## Prerequisites

- No familiarity with C# or .NET is assumed, though it might be helpful
