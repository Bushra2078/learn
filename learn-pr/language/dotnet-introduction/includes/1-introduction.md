If you're new to programming, understanding exactly what is .NET might be challenging. The term *.NET* seems to be applied to many things, but how are they related? How do the various aspects of .NET work together to create a working application?

In this module, you'll learn about .NET and its ecosystem. You'll learn about both the technical aspects of the system and how each part helps to build software. You'll learn about the ecosystem as a whole and the available resources. You'll learn how to use .NET to address many software development needs. Finally, you'll write your first lines of C# code by using a web-based editor so that you can see how the parts of .NET work together to create a .NET application.

By the end of this module, you'll have started building a mental model of .NET. This mental model will prove vital as you take your next steps in building .NET applications.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the major parts of .NET and its ecosystem.
- Write code in Try .NET and explain how the parts of .NET come together to produce a running application.
- Choose when it makes sense to use .NET to build your applications.

## Prerequisites

- No familiarity with C# or .NET is assumed, but it might be helpful.
