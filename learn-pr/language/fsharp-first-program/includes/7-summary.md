In this module, you've built several programs. You learned to declare and use variables to store data. Variables can be declare with or without the type. If it's the former, then the type will be inferred from the value it's assigned initially. 

You also learned how to print values to a screen and you now know the difference between various print functions. As part of printing to a screen, depending on used print function, you need to use a formatter to indicate the data type you are printing, if you combine it with a string.

Next you learned about reading from a console. Reading input from a console turns the read data into a string and to be able to work with such data you need to convert it to the intended target type. There's conversion functions for most basic types and you can use an idiomatic way of converting or a converter from the `System` namespace.

Finally you explored some operators and how they could be used to carry out arithmetic operations.
