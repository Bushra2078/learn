    "\n",
    "To create an `if` statement in Python, define a test expression that can have a value of either `True` or `False`, followed by an indented block of code that will run if the condition is met. \n",

    "```python\n",
    "if test_expression:\n",
    "    # statement(s) to be run\n",
    "```\n",

    "To write a program with more complex conditional logic, you can add `else` and `elif` statements to your code block. You can also nest conditional statements. \n",
