Booleans are a common type in Python. Their value can only ever be one of two things: true or false. Understanding how to use Boolean values is critical, because you'll need them to write *conditional logic*. 

## Scenario: Print warning messages

Suppose you're creating a program that identify if a piece of space debris is a danger to a spacecraft. If the object is larger than a specified size and will come within range of the spacecraft, a maneuver needs to be performed to avoid a collision. Otherwise, the spacecraft can stay on course.

In this module, you'll use Boolean keywords and operators to write several types of conditional expressions, and determine the spacecraft's reaction.

## What will you learn?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Run code under a variety of conditions by using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.
- Combine conditional logic and create more complex conditions by using `and` and `or` operators.

## What is the main objective?

This module teaches you how to use conditional logic to create decision-driven programs.
