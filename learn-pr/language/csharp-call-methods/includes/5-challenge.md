Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

In this exercise, you'll use either Intellisense or Microsoft Learn documentation to find and call a method that returns the larger of two numbers.

### Step 1: Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor, then select the <kbd>Del</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to delete it.

### Step 2: Use a method of the System.Math class to determine which of two numbers is larger

Use the following code as the starting point for your code:

```csharp-interactive
int firstValue = 500;
int secondValue = 600;
int largerValue;

Console.WriteLine(largerValue);
```

Your job is to research and fill in the missing line of code that calls a method from Math class that will accept two values and return the larger of the two values into the variable `largerValue`, which will be printed to the console.

When you run your code, you should get the following output:

```output
600
```

To accomplish this, you'll use a method on the `System.Math` class. You can use either Intellisense or Microsoft Learn to find the method and figure out how to call it properly.

Whether you get stuck and need to peek at the solution or you finish successfully, continue on to view a solution to this challenge.
