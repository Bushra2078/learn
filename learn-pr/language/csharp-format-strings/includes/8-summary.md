Our company needed to create a personalized marketing message to promote a new financial product to our customers. Using C#, we were able to write code that combined string and numeric data about our current customers.

We exercised different techniques for merging a string template with variables using composite formatting and string interpolation. The various specifiers allowed us to properly format large numbers, currency, and percentages. The built-in methods on variables of type string allowed us to add padding to left and right align data.

Imagine how much extra work this task would've required if we didn't have a wealth of string and number formatting tools and techniques available to us in C#. We'd likely attempt to use string concatenation everywhere, possibly making it difficult to maintain or update.

Techniques and tools for formatting strings and numeric data have a wide array of applications. For example, we can use these techniques to present data for display on screen as well as format data to transfer between disparate systems. It's a critical skill to master. This module discussed some of the most popular and useful, but there are more.
