From a high-level perspective, software developers are concerned with:

- **Data input**, including data typed in by a user from a keyboard, using their mouse, a device, or by another software system via a network request.
- **Data processing**, including decision logic, manipulating data, performing calculations, and so on.
- **Data output**, including presentation to an end user via a command-line message, a window, a web page, or saving the processed data into a file, sending it to a network service, and so on.

In this module, we'll focus on that last concern. We'll work with string data, formatting it with alignment and spacing. We'll format data for presentation as currency and other numbers. By the end of this module, we'll have new tools we can use to output data to our users that conveys and clarifies its meaning.

Suppose we work for a marketing department that will send thousands of personalized letters to our company's existing clients, who are institutional investors. Our team's job is to promote new financial products to the customer. Each letter we send will merge personalized information about the customer. It'll compare the returns of their current portfolios with projected returns using our newest products. How will we merge and format the data correctly?

In this module, you'll learn how to work with string and numeric data to solve real-world business problems in C#. You'll create a mockup of a receipt issued for products sold, and you'll merge data to send a personalized marketing message to customers.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Merge string templates with variables using composite formatting.
- Use various format specifiers to properly display percentages, currency, and numbers.

## Prerequisites

- Introductory experience with creating and initializing variables of type `string` and `decimal`
- Introductory experience with literal values of type `string` and `decimal`
- Introductory experience with `Console.WriteLine()`
