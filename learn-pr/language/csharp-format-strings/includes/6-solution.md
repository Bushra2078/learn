The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```csharp-interactive
string customerName = "Mr. Jones";

string currentProduct = "Magic Yield";
int currentShares = 2975000;
decimal currentReturn = 0.1275m;
decimal currentProfit = 55000000.0m;

string newProduct = "Glorious Future";
decimal newReturn = 0.13125m;
decimal newProfit = 63000000.0m;

Console.WriteLine($"Dear {customerName},");
Console.WriteLine($"As a customer of our {currentProduct} offering we are excited to tell you about a new financial product that would dramatically increase your return.\n");
Console.WriteLine($"Currently, you own {currentShares:C} shares at a return of {currentReturn:P}.\n");
Console.WriteLine($"Our new product, {newProduct} offers a return of {newReturn:P}.  Given your current volume, your potential profit would be {newProfit:C}.\n");

Console.WriteLine("Here's a quick comparison:\n");

string comparisonMessage = "";

comparisonMessage = currentProduct.PadRight(20);
comparisonMessage += String.Format("{0:P}", currentReturn).PadRight(10);
comparisonMessage += String.Format("{0:C}", currentProfit).PadRight(20);

comparisonMessage += "\n";
comparisonMessage += newProduct.PadRight(20);
comparisonMessage += String.Format("{0:P}", newReturn).PadRight(10);
comparisonMessage += String.Format("{0:C}", newProfit).PadRight(20);

Console.WriteLine(comparisonMessage);
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because a lot depends on how you decided to implement the logic.  As long as you used the techniques that we covered in this module to format strings, pad strings, and so on, and the output matches the challenge output, then you did great!

```output
Dear Mr. Jones,
As a customer of our Magic Yield offering we are excited to tell you about a new financial product that would dramatically increase your return.

Currently, you own 2,975,000.00 shares at a return of 12.75 %.

Our new product, Glorious Future offers a return of 13.13 %.  Given your current volume, your potential profit would be ¤63,000,000.00.

Here's a quick comparison:

Magic Yield         12.75 %   ¤55,000,000.00      
Glorious Future     13.13 %   ¤63,000,000.00  
```

If you succeeded, congratulations!  Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
