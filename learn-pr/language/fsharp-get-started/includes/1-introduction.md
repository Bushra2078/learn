F# is an open-source, cross-platform programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, performant, robust, and practical code

F# runs anywhere .NET runs. That means you can leverage the vast .NET ecosystem and tools to build different kind of applications such as:

- Web APIs
- Single-Page applications (SPA)
- WebAssembly
- Desktop
- Mobile
- Big data
- Data science & machine learning
- Internet-of-Things (IoT)
- Gaming

F# is extensible as well and in cases where your application needs to run in a JavaScript environment, there are various libraries you can use.

In this module you will:

- Understand why F# is a great language for building all types of applications.
- Write your first line of F# code.
- Build your first F# console application.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to write F# code to print a message to a text console, like the Windows command prompt or Linux bash shell. These lines of code will give you your first look at the F# syntax, and immediately provide invaluable insights into what makes F# a great choice for developing applications.
