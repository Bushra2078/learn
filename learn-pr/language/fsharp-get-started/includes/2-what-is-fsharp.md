F# is an open-source, cross-platform programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, performant, robust, and practical code.

## Why F#?

There are many language features and aspects of the F# language that make it easy to be productive when writing code:

### Succinct

Being able to write less code not only cuts down on your development time, but it also makes your code easier to read. 

- **Type inference**: As a result of its strong type system, the F# compiler is able to analyze your code and infer the data types you're working with without explicitly defining them.
- **Lightweight syntax**: F# lets you be productive without writing too much boilerplate code. Its lightweight syntax let you focus on the core components of your application.

### Performant

F# code is able to handle any workload. 

- **Built-in parallelism & concurrency**: F# has language features like `async` expressions that simplify the process of writing concurrent code to safely make the most of your compute resources.
- **Leverage the performance of the .NET Runtime**: The .NET runtime is able to efficiently handle large workloads across a wide range of deployment targets.

### Robust

When you develop code, you want to make sure that it stands the test of time. By using tooling, you 

- **Immutable by default**: Having immutability by default makes you can process your data without affecting the original data. Therefore you're able to apply changes to your data and have a high degree of certainty in what the outcome is making code simpler to reason about and test.
- **Null value handling**: Errors in an application due to null values can be costly. As a result, code bases can often be riddled with code to check for and handle null values. In F#, you can use the `Option` type to safely handle scenarios where `null` values may arise.
- **Works with .NET libraries**: The .NET ecosystem has a rich ecosystem of libraries. As a .NET language, F# can take advantage of those libraries and use them inside your applications.
- **Professional-grade tooling**: Use lightweight text editors such as Visual Studio Code or an IDE like Visual Studio.

### Practical

By providing support for multiple and letting you get straight into code through it's interactive programming environment.

- **Strong functional & object programming support**: Regardless of the patterns you implement in your applications, with F# you don't have to choose because it provides strong support for both functional and object programming. 
- **Interactive programming**: F# via F# Interactive provides scripting capabilities. Instead of compiling your code inside an F# project, you can get started writing and evaluating your code logic interactively via the console or through script files. For more visual environments such as when building visualizations, you can use tools like .NET notebooks via .NET Interactive.
