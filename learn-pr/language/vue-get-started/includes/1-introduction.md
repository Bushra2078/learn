*Vue.js* (also called *Vue*) was created by Evan You and was first released in February 2014. His objective for Vue was to create a progressive, lightweight version of JavaScript.

Vue was designed to allow developers to create a user interface by adding a set of custom HTML attributes that connect software components with data. To accomplish this task, Vue.js interprets the HTML attributes as *directives* that bind input or output parts of the page to a model. The model is represented by standard JavaScript variables. 

You can add the Vue core library to any page and immediately start creating dynamic HTML markup that uses powerful features for data binding and event handling. When you finish this training module, you'll be able to use the Vue.js framework to create a functional application.
