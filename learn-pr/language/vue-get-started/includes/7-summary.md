Vue.js is a powerful, lightweight framework based on JavaScript. It's simple to use, and it allows you to create responsive front-end applications. You can apply Vue.js incrementally, without breaking your existing application. You can also scale up the complexity of your app, adding server-side functionality by using the Vue CLI and other builder tools.

This module introduced you to the Vue.js JavaScript framework. You saw how to start by using a code editor. You set up an HTML application page and created a Vue.js code file that you linked in the HTML file. Finally, you created a starter application and displayed dynamic data on the page by using HTML attributes and attribute bindings.
