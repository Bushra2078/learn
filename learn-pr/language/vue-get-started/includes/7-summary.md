In summary, Vue.js is a powerful, lightweight framework based on JavaScript. It's simple to use, and allows you to create responsive front-end applications. You can apply Vue.js incrementally, without breaking your existing application. You can also scale up the complexity of your app by adding server-side functionality using the Vue CLI and other builder tools.
