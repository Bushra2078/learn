quiz:
  questions:
  - content: Select the correct statement from options listed.
    choices:
    - content: Vue applications must make an external call to a back end server that hosts a database application.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While a Vue application can make use of a back end server and database, it is not necessary because Vue is capable of allowing you to build powerful single-page applications on the front end in an HTML web browser.
    - content: In order to create a Vue application, you will need to re-write your existing framework.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Vue is described as a progressive application, which means it can be added to any existing framework and implemented in a progressive manner. This means you can start with simple functionality and continue to build a more complex application, as needed.
    - content: A Vue application can be implemented by entering a simple script tag in an HTML document that references the Vue core library.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: There is no need to use external tools or an external server to build a powerful single-page application in an HTML web browser. The Vue application details can be scripted within the HTML page, or the page can be linked to a separate JavaScript file that contains the Vue application code.
  - content: Which of the following represents the correct way to dynamically bind an attribute to an expression within an HTML interface?
    choices:
    - content: "<img v-bind src=''selected_prod_img'''>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While v-bind is the correct directive for dynamically binding an attribute to an expression, you must use the colon (:) between v-bind and the name of the attribute. The correct answer is `<img :src="selected_prod_img">`, which uses a simple colon as shorthand notation for `v-bind:`.
    - content: "<img src=''{{ selected_prod_img }}''>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While placing the data object name within curly braces is the correct way to tell Vue to print the data inside an HTML tag, you must use the v-bind directive to bind application data to an attribute for an HTML tag. The correct answer is: `<img :src=''selected_prod_img'''>`, which uses a simple colon as shorthand notation for `v-bind:`."
    - content: "<img :src=''selected_prod_img'''>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: While placing the data object name within curly braces is the correct way to tell Vue to print the data within an HTML tag, you must use the v-bind directive to bind application data to an attribute for an HTML tag. Include a colon (:) between v-bind and the name of the attribute, or use the colon by itself as a form of Vue shorthand notation.
  - content: Which of the following statements is correct with regard to the way Vue.js lets you manage style and class bindings?
    choices:
    - content: Vue allows you to use shorthand notation for `v-on` directives but you cannot use shorthand for `v-bind` when applying class and style bindings.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Vue allows you to use shorthand notation for `v-on` directives and all `v-bind` directives.
    - content: If you want to add several style properties to an HTML element, you need to apply `v-bind` directives using separate in-line styles.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can bind to an entire class of styles, including properties that are defined in your application.
    - content: You can apply multiple style and class bindings simultaneously on one HTML element.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! Well done.
