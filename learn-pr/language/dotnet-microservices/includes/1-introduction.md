In recent years, enterprises are choosing microservices over monolithic architectures for their large consumer applications to meet user demand, and increase scalability and availability.

Suppose that you started a new job as a software developer at the Contoso outdoor equipment company. Business is booming, and so is Contoso's website that indicates whether items are in stock or not. That website is a monolith right now, but is an ideal candidate for the microservice architecture. A team member refactored the monolith website into an ASP.NET Blazor page application and a .NET web API. Your job is to deploy the services.

In this module, you'll gain an understanding of the microservice architectural pattern and the problems it solves. You'll see how you can use Docker to implement the microservice architectural pattern with an ASP.NET web API.

By the end of this module, you'll have the foundation necessary to build microservices with .NET and understand how you can use Docker to implement the microservice architectural pattern.

## Learning objectives
