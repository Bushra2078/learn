In recent years, enterprises have been choosing microservices over monolithic architecture for their large consumer applications to meet user demand and increase scalability and availability.

Suppose that you've started a new job as a software developer at the world's most popular pizza joint, Contoso Pizza. Business is booming, and Contoso Pizza has a website that indicates whether pizzas are in stock or not. That website is a monolith right now, but it's an ideal candidate for the microservice architecture. A team member has already refactored the monolith website into an ASP.NET Core Razor page application and ASP.NET Core web API. Your job is to deploy the services.

In this module, you'll gain an understanding of the microservice architectural pattern and the problem it solves. You'll see how you can use Docker to implement the microservice architectural pattern with an ASP.NET Core web API.

By the end of this module, you'll have the foundation necessary to build microservices with .NET and understand how you can use Docker to implement the microservice architectural pattern.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain what microservices are.
