  title: Build your first microservice with .NET
  description: Microservice applications are composed of small, independently versioned, and scalable customer-focused services that communicate with each other by using standard protocols and well-defined interfaces. Each microservice typically encapsulates simple business logic, which you can scale out or in, test, deploy, and manage independently. Smaller teams develop a microservice based on a customer scenario and use any technologies that they want to use. This module teaches you how to build your first microservice by using .NET.
