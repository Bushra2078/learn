In this module you've learned about functions and some patterns that go with it. Functions enable you to reuse functionality by acting as named references to a group of statements that you are likely to repeat often. Function also takes parameters, which makes them flexible. 

Additionally, you also learned that most of the time, the F# compiler is able to figure out the type of your parameters and the type your functions return, but sometimes you need to help the compiler and state what type it should be explicitly. Another benefit of adding types is that it makes for an easier read (most tools help out pointing types though).

Apart from the foundations of functions, you learned some useful patterns, patterns like composition, pipeline, and partial applications. Some of these patterns are part of the functional programming paradigm and some are implementation details with F#. Composition is about combining several functions into a more advanced function and pipelines is more about operating on data and take a function, add an argument, and produce a value and doing so in longer sequence.
