In this module, you've learned about functions and some patterns that go with it. A function enables you to reuse functionality by acting as as a named reference to a group of expressions that you are likely to repeat often. Functions also take parameters, which makes them flexible.

Additionally, you learned that, most of the time, the F# compiler is able to figure out the types for your parameters and the types your functions return. Sometimes, though, you need to help the compiler and explictly state a type for a parameter or return. Another benefit of adding types is that it makes for an easier read (most tools help out pointing types).

Apart from the foundations of functions, you learned some useful patterns, like composition and pipeline. Composition is about combining several functions into a more advanced function. Pipelines are about operating on data, and take a function, add an argument, and produce a value, doing so in longer sequence.
