In this module, you've learned about functions and some patterns that go with it. A function enables you to reuse functionality by acting as a named reference to a group of expressions that you are likely to repeat often. Functions also take parameters, which makes them flexible.

Additionally, you learned that, most of the time, the F# compiler can figure out the types for your parameters and function returns. Sometimes, though, you need to help the compiler and explicitly state a type for a parameter or return. Another benefit of adding types is that it makes for an easier read (most tools help out appointing types).

Apart from the foundations of functions, you learned some useful patterns, like composition and pipeline. Composition is about combining several functions into a more advanced function. Pipelines are about operating on data; a pipeline takes a function, adds an argument, and produces a value, doing so repeatedly in a longer sequence.
