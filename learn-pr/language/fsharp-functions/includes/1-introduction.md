You will often find yourself writing code that can be reused in the project you're in, or you might even want to reuse said functionality across many projects. To make reuse of possible, you need to create functions, a named reference to a set of statements. There's more to functions than just serving as named references though. Architecting with functions allows you to go down the route of functional programming, should you wish. There, you can apply focus more on a declarative approach, specify what you want done over exactly how.

It should be stated though that F# is a multi paradigm language that supports object programming and functional programming.

In this module, you will be taken through a journey from understanding what a function is, how it can be defined and called, to learning about more advanced concepts you'd find in the functional programming paradigm.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Define and use functions.
- Explore Functional programming.
- Compose functions and use pipelines.
