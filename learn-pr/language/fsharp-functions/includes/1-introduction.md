You'll often find yourself writing code that can be reused in a project, or even across many projects. To reuse code, you need to know how to create a function, which is a named reference to a set of expressions. There's more to functions than just serving as named references though. When you architect with functions, you can compose smaller functions into larger functions.

In this module, you'll learn what a function is and how it can be defined and called. You'll also learn about more advanced concepts like how to compose functions and create pipelines.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Define and use functions.
- Use pipelines to operate on data.
- Compose functions to create larger functions.
