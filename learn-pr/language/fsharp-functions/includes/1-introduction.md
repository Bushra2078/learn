You will often find yourself writing code that can be reused in the project you're in, or you might even want to reuse said functionality across many projects. To make reuse of code possible, you need to create functions, a named reference to a set of expressions. There's more to functions than just serving as named references though. Architecting with functions allows you to compose smaller functions into larger functions.

In this module, you will be taken through a journey from understanding what a function is, how it can be defined and called, to learning about more advanced concepts like composing functions and creating pipelines.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Define and use functions.
- Use pipelines to operate on data.
- Compose functions to create larger functions.
