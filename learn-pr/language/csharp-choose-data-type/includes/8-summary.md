Choosing the right data type for your application is a vital programming skill. Our goal was to understand the differences between each data type so that we could make an informed decision when it comes time to choose the data types on which we'll rely when writing code.

You've started building a mental model of how data is stored as your application executes. You have experience working with new *integral* and *floating point* data types. You have criteria you can use when deciding which data types to employ in your code. Finally, you understand why you need to use the `new` keyword when creating instances of reference types.

There's even more to learn about data types. In this module, we merely looked at built-in types, but you can also design and implement your own custom data types using structs, enums and classes. You'll learn about these in other modules.
