Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before proceeding.

You've been asked to add a feature to your company's software. The feature is intended to improve the renewal rate of subscriptions to the software. Your task is to display a renewal message when a user logs into the software system and is notified their subscription will soon end. You'll need to add a couple of decision statements to properly add branching logic to the application to satisfy the requirements.

### Step 1 - Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor, and then press <kbd>Delete</kbd>, or press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to delete it.

### Step 2 - Copy the following code as a starting point to the .NET Editor

```csharp-interactive
Random random = new Random();
int daysUntilExpiration = random.Next(12);
int discountPercentage = 0;

// Your code goes here
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only remove the code comments. In other words, you may remove the line of code that starts with `//`, but you may not remove any other code. Furthermore, you must use all of the variables in your code.

### Step 3 - Use two if statements to implement the following business rules (nest three in first if statement)

**Rule 1**. If the user's subscription will expire in 10 days or less, display the message:

```output
Your subscription will expire soon. Renew now!
```

**Rule 2**. If the user's subscription will expire in five days or less, display the messages:

```output
Your subscription expires in _ days.
Renew now and save 10%!
```

Make sure to substitute _ for the value stored in the variable `daysUntilExpiration`.

**Rule 3**. If the user's subscription will expire in one day, display the message:

```output
Your subscription expires within a day!
Renew now and save 20%!
```

**Rule 4**.  If the user's subscription has expired, display the message:

```output
Your subscription has expired.
```

**Rule 5**. If the user's subscription doesn't expire in 10 days or less, display nothing.
