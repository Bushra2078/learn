In this module, you explored concepts, basic syntax of the C++ language. You constructed a program in C++ by writing your first lines of C++ code.

Additionally, you learned a technique for displaying literal string data to the console. You learned to identify programming errors in your code and their corresponding error message. 

Lastly, you identified C++ syntax elements like objects and functions and the purpose of several special symbols that are known as operators.

Congratulations on taking your first steps to building more sophisticated applications.
