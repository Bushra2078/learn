Let's briefly go over the terms and syntax you used in the *Hello World* program. Breaking down the syntax can give you insight into the concepts behind the language and its structure.

## Syntax

To better understand what's going on, it's helpful to go through the syntax of the program line by line, starting at the top row:

- **`#include <iostream>`**: `iostream` is part of a standard library. Many components in a program are defined either by standard libraries or by libraries that you or a third party write. The code uses `iostream`, which is part of a standard library, to use the object `cout` to print something as output.

   :::code language="cpp" source="../code/include.cpp" range="1" highlight="1":::

- **`using namespace std;`**: A *namespace* helps prevent name conflicts in large projects. You want to use the functionalities of a namespace throughout the code without repeatedly calling the namespace when it's required. So, you declare the namespace at the beginning of the code. Also, the syntax that's required for using `cout` is `std::cout`. By adding the line `using namespace std;`, you don't need to repetitively use `std`.

   :::code language="cpp" source="../code/include.cpp" range="1-2" highlight="2":::

- **`int main()`**: `main()` is a global function and the designated start of a program. Every C++ program has a mandatory `main()` function. A *function* is a set of statements that perform a task together. The `int` used before `main()` says that this function expects an integer to be returned.

- **`cout`**: `cout` prints a specific string as output. `std::cout` is part of a collection of data and operations of the `std::ostream` class.

   :::code language="cpp" source="../code/include.cpp" highlight="5":::

- **`"Hello World"`**: The output *Hello World* is written in double quotes (`""`). You can use `std::string` in many ways. The main two ways to use `std::string` are as a *C-string (character array)* or as a *`string` class*. `char` is a primitive data type.

  We use different data types, like *integer*, *float*, *double*, and *char*, to express and store values. For example, an integer might be `123`, a float might be `9.02`, and a char might be `'a'`.

- **`\n`**: Use `\n` to terminate the string and move to the next line. `\n` is called an *escape sequence*.

- **`return 0`**: When you declare the `int main()` function, you specify `int` to declare the function, which returns an integer. If the function is preceded by `int`, it expects an integer in the return. By using `return 0`, you make sure that an integer is returned to complete the function. Here, `return` is the keyword and `0` is the integer.
