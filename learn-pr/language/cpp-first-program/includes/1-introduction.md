C++ was modeled to be an extension of C Language to support procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. It's a compiler-based programming language, which is statically typed and case-sensitive.
The uses of C++ are limitless.  Here's some example of where C++ is used:

- **For the Web**. C++ is used in making of **Web Browser** and their plugins and extensions.
- **In operating systems**. It has contribution in **Operating Systems** as many parts of windows versions were written in C++. The Symbian OS is mostly written in C++.
- **Compilers** for languages like C# and Java are written in C++. In fact, many C++ compilers are written in C++.
- **Media applications**. Used for making **media applications** and managing audio/video files. Example - Win-amp. Even used in applications where real-time audio is implemented like the audio books or transcribing a real-time video.
- **Created database engines**. C++ has been used in developing **database applications** like MYSQL.
- **Game development**. A wide variety of **Animation** and **Games** require C++ for modeling, 3D animation, rendering, and simulations. The **Games Engines** used to make games are frequently developed in C++. 
- **Medical engineering**. In recent times, we've also seen a huge rise in applications of C++ in Medical Engineering. Widely used in machines that have scanning such as MRI. C++ is used in various embedded systems.
- **Robotics**. In many cases, C++ is used to program the micro-controller to increase the performance and productivity of the system. The reason behind why C++ is used in robotics is because a lot of hardware libraries are written in C++ as they allow  interaction with low-level hardware.

## Scenario

As a developer on team, you're looking to evaluate C++. And if it can be a good fit for the applications, you and your team builds. What's important for your team and your company is to develop applications that are fast and are memory efficient? Also, the language needs to have many users and a large community to ensure there's support for issues and tutorials.

## What will you learn

In this module you'll learn to:

- Write C++ using basic syntax.
- Distinguish terminologies of C++ like datatypes, libraries, Functions, and so on.
- Explain the basic makeup of a program in C++.

## What is the main goal

The module covers writing your first C++ program and getting you the confidence to develop in C++.
