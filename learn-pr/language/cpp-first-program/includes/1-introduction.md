C++ was modeled as an extension of the C language. C++ was designed to support procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. It's a compiler-based programming language, so it's statically typed and case-sensitive. The uses of C++ are limitless.

Here's some example of where C++ is used:

- **For the web**. C++ is used to create web browsers and their plugins and extensions.

- **In operating systems**. C++ contributes to operating systems. Many versions of Windows were in part written in C++. The Symbian OS is mostly written in C++.

- **Compilers**. Compilers for languages like C# and Java are written in C++. In fact, many C++ compilers are written in C++.

- **Media applications**. C++ is used to create media applications and manage audio and video files. C++ is used in applications that implement real-time audio, like audiobooks and apps that transcribe video in real time.

- **Database engines**. C++ has been used to develop database applications, like MySQL.

- **Game development**. A wide variety of animation and games require C++ for modeling, 3D animation, rendering, and simulations. Game engines that are used to make games frequently are developed by using C++.

- **Medical engineering**. Developers who work in the field of medical engineering recently have created more applications by using C++. C++ is widely used in machines that use scanning technology, like MRI. C++ also is used in various embedded systems.

- **Robotics**. In many cases, developers use C++ to program a microcontroller, to increase the performance and productivity of a robotics system. Numerous hardware libraries are written in C++ because they allow interaction with low-level hardware.

## Scenario

As a developer on a team of developers, you're looking to evaluate C++. You want to determine whether C++ might be a good fit for the applications you and your team build. What's important for your team and for your company is to develop applications that are fast and memory-efficient. Also, the language needs to be common and well established, with a large community to ensure support for issues and access to tutorials.

## What will you learn

In this module you'll learn to:

- Write a program in C++ by using basic syntax.
- Learn C++ terminology, including data types, libraries, and functions.
- Learn how to identify and correct common programming errors.

## What is the main goal

This module shows you how to write your first C++ program and helps you gain confidence in developing in C++.
