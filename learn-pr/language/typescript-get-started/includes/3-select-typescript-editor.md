You can write TypeScript code in any text editor or IDE of your choice.

In this exercise, you'll learn about your text-editor options and then set up Visual Studio Code so you can complete the remaining exercises in this module.

## The TypeScript Playground

Earlier, you wrote some simple TypeScript code in the [Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?azure-portal=true). The Playground is a place where you can write, share, and learn TypeScript. You can use it to:

- Learn TypeScript in a place where nothing can break.
- Experiment with TypeScript syntax and share the URLs with others.
- Experiment with the various compiler features of TypeScript.

In this course, you'll occasionally visit the Playground to try out new TypeScript concepts.

## Integrated development environments

For more full-featured TypeScript editing and tools, you'll find many [integrated development environments (IDEs)](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support?azure-portal=true) that support TypeScript or have plug-ins or tooling packages that are developed to support it. In this module, we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true), but you're free to use whatever editor you prefer.

### Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a free, lightweight source code editor that runs on your desktop on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, and it has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes.

To install Visual Studio Code:

1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true) page, and select the download option for your operating system.

1. If you want more setup guidance, visit the installation page for your operating system:

   - [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux?azure-portal=true)
   - [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac?azure-portal=true)
   - [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows?azure-portal=true)

Now that you have a code editor, you're ready to install TypeScript.
