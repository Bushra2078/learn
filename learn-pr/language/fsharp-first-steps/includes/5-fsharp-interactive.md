Sometimes you don't want to go through the process of creating, packaging, and distributing an application. F# Interactive is an interactive programming and scripting environment makes it simple to go from idea to code by letting you write and evaluate code in real-time through the console or standalone script files.

## Starting F# Interactive

F# Interactive is built into the .NET SDK and can be started with the .NET CLI `dotnet fsi` command.

```dotnetcli
dotnet fsi
```

## Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL)

Starting F# Interactive launches you into a read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) session where you can write your F# code and immediately evaluate its output in the console.

```fsharp
Microsoft (R) F# Interactive version 11.4.2.0 for F# 5.0 
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved.

For help type #help;;

>
```

## Run and evaluate expressions

To evaluate your input, you must enter it after the `>` character.

```fsharp
> #help;;
```

Running the `#help` command for example outputs the F# Interactive help menu

```console
F# Interactive directives:

    #r "file.dll";;                               // Reference (dynamically load) the given DLL
    #i "package source uri";;                     // Include package source uri when searching for packages
    #I "path";;                                   // Add the given search path for referenced DLLs
    #load "file.fs" ...;;                         // Load the given file(s) as if compiled and referenced
    #time ["on"|"off"];;                          // Toggle timing on/off
    #help;;                                       // Display help
    #r "nuget:FSharp.Data, 3.1.2";;               // Load Nuget Package 'FSharp.Data' version '3.1.2'
    #r "nuget:FSharp.Data";;                      // Load Nuget Package 'FSharp.Data' with the highest version
    #quit;;                                       // Exit
    
F# Interactive command line options:

    See 'dotnet fsi --help' for options
```

Note that the end of an expression is delimited by the `;;` characters. This means that no code is evaluated until you input the `;;` characters. This is useful when writing multi-line expressions since your code is not delimited by new line characters.

Evaluating F# code works the same way. The following code prints out a message to the console.

```fsharp
> printfn "Hello World!";;
```

The evaluated output is the following:

```console
Hello World!
val it : unit = ()
```

The first line displays the output from the evaluated code while the second line displays output's type information. In this case, the value output to the console is of type `unit`, which is represented by the `()` token and bound to the `it` name. You can access the `it` value later on in your program if you want to perform additional operations.

## Exiting the REPL

Once you're done using the F# Interactive REPL, use the `#q` or `#quit` commands to exit.

```fsharp
> #q;;
```

## fsx script files

As you write more code, you can save your code in a script with the *fsx* file extension.

Using the same example of printing out a message to the console, I can create a file called *my-script.fsx* to write my code in.

```fsharp
printfn "Hello World!"
```

One thing to note though is that in *fsx* files, you no longer need to use `;;` at the end of your expressions. This is because in script files, F# Interactive is able to use standard F# code formatting guidelines like indentation and new lines.

Instead of compiling source code and then later running the compiled assembly, you can just run `dotnet fsi` and specify the name of your script file containing your F# code, and F# interactive reads the code and executes it in real time.

```dotnetcli
dotnet fsi my-script.fsx
```

Running this script produces the following output.

```console
Hello World!
```
