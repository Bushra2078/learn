F# is an open-source, cross-platform programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, performant, robust, and practical code

F# runs anywhere .NET runs and F# is extensible as well and in cases where your application needs to run in a JavaScript environment, there are various libraries you can use.

F# has numerous features that include:

- **Lightweight syntax:** Write low-ceremony code and focus on the core logic of your application.
- **Immutable by default:** Apply predictable & repeatable transformations to your data without worrying about side-effects.
- **Type inference and automatic generalization:** Leverage the compiler to get the benefits of a statically typed language without explicitly defining your types.
- **Powerful data types:** Represent complex data & model domains using tuples, records, and discriminated unions.
- **Pattern matching:** Enforce correctness in your application's behavior using the compiler.
- **Asynchronous programming:** Support for asynchronous workflows out of the box.

In this module you will:

- Understand what makes F# a good language for building applications
- Write your first line of F# code.
- Build your first F# console application.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to write F# code to print a message to a text console, like the Windows command prompt or Linux bash shell. These lines of code will give you your first look at the F# syntax, and immediately provide invaluable insights into what makes F# a great programming language.
