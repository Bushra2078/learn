The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```python
value = input('Would you like to continue? ')

if value == 'y' or value == 'yes':
    print('Continuing ...')
    print('Complete!')
elif value == 'n' or value == 'no':
    print('Exiting')
else:
    print('Please try again and respond with yes or no.')
```

This code is only *one possible solution* because we didn't specify that you had to use the logical operators. You could have solved this challenge by using nested if statements instead. Or you could have checked for the "no" scenario before the "yes" scenario. You might have selected a different variable name to use to store the user's input.

If you matched the expected output in the challenge, you were successful.

Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
