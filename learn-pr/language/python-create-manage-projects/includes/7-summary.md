This module introduced you to the idea of using libraries that someone else has written. You learned how to use `pip` to install these libraries and to upgrade or remove them as needed.

Libraries are continuously worked on. To track that improvement work, each version of a library is assigned a version number. Different applications on your computer may rely on different versions of the same library.

You then learned about the concept of a virtual environment. By using a virtual environment, you isolate yourself and your Python project from the rest of the machine.

Within the virtual environment, you bring your own Python runtime and libraries that are installed only within the virtual environment. A benefit to using a virtual environment is that you don't affect other Python projects running on the same machine that needs libraries and Python runtimes of a version that's not compatible with what your project needs.

You also learned how to install libraries from a list of libraries and how to upgrade libraries in a responsible way.
