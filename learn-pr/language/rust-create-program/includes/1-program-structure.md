Let's examine the following code and learn how a simple Rust program is structured:

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, world!");
}
```


## The main function

Our first Rust program defines a *function* named `main`. A function is a block of code that does a specific task. We separate the code in our program into blocks based on task. This separation makes the code easier to understand and maintain. After we define a function for a task, we can call the function when we need to do that task. 

Every Rust program must have **one** function named `main`. The code in the `main` function is always the first code run in a Rust program. We can call other functions from within the `main` function, or from within other functions. 


## Functions and arguments

To declare a function in Rust, we use the `fn` keyword. After the function name, we tell the compiler how many parameters or *arguments* the function expects as input. The set of arguments is listed inside parentheses `()`. When the parentheses are empty, the function doesn't have any input arguments. Our `main` function is an example of a function that doesn't have any input arguments.

```rust
fn main() // Our main function has no input arguments
```


## The function body

The code that does the task of a function is defined inside curly brackets `{}`. We call this code the *function body*. It's a best practice to format the code so the opening curly bracket for the function body appears right after the argument list in parentheses. 

```rust
fn main() {
    // Code for the function body
}
```


## Code indentation

In the function body, most code statements end with a semicolon `;`. Rust processes these statements one after the other in order. When a code statement doesn't end with a semicolon, Rust knows the next line of code must be executed before the starting statement can be complete. 

To help see the execution relationships in the code, we use indentation. This format shows how the code is organized and reveals the flow of steps to complete the function task. A starting code statement is indented four spaces from the left margin. When the code doesn't end in a semicolon, the next line of code to execute is indented four more spaces.

Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() { // The function declaration is not indented

    // First step in function body
        // Substep: execute before First step can be complete

    // Second step in function body
        // Substep A: execute before Second step can be complete
        // Substep B: execute before Second step can be complete
            // Sub-substep 1: execute before Substep B can be complete

    // Third step in function body, and so on...
}
```


## The println! macro

Our `main` function does one task. It calls the `println!` macro that's predefined in Rust. A macro is a like a function, and it takes a variable number of input arguments. The `println!` macro expects one or more input arguments, which it displays to the screen or *standard output*. In our example, we pass one input argument to the macro, the text string "Hello, world!"

```rust
fn main() {
    // Our main function does one task: call the println! macro
    // println! displays the input "Hello, world!" to the screen
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```


## Value substitution for {} arguments

In the Rust Learn module lessons, we often call the `println!` macro with a list of arguments that includes text strings with instances of curly brackets `{}` and other values. The `println!` macro replaces each instance of curly brackets `{}` inside a text string with the value of the next argument in the list. 

Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Call println! with three arguments: a string, a value, a value
    println!("The first letter of the English alphabet is {} and the last letter is {}.", 'A', 'Z');
}
```

We call the `println!` macro with three arguments: a string, a value, and another value. The macro processes the arguments in order. Each instance of curly brackets `{}` inside the text string is replaced with the value of the next argument in the list.

The output is:

```output
The first letter of the English alphabet is A and the last letter is Z.
```
