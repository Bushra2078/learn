Visual Studio provides powerful tools to help you debug and diagnose issues in your applications as you develop. These tools can also be used to debug problems with apps that are running on other computers, or even hosted in Azure.

## Fix Bugs Before the Application Launches

Suppose you work for a team that recently built and deployed an application to Azure App Service. However, although the app runs finally locally, you have started to notice issues once it is deployed to production in Azure. You're looking for additional tools and assistance to quickly track down the problems that are impacting real users. It is sometimes faster to troubleshoot these issues directly in production, rather than spending time trying to recreate the issue in development environments.

## What will we be doing?

This module shows you how to use Visual Studio remote debugging features with Azure App Service. You'll see how to attach to and directly debug processes that are running externally in the cloud.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to use Visual Studio's debugging tools to diagnose problems in your applications hosted on Azure App Service.
