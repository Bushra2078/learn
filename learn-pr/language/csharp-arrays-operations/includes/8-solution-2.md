The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit:

```csharp-interactive
string orderStream = "B123,C234,A345,C15,B177,G3003,C235,B179";
string[] items = orderStream.Split(',');

foreach (var item in items)
{
    if (item.StartsWith("B"))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(item);
    }
}
```

This code is merely *one possible solution*, because we didn't specify which technique to apply to which line of output. You could've used either the `Console.WriteLine()` or `Console.Write()` methods to produce the desired output.

```output
B123
B177
B179
```

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue to the knowledge check in the next unit.
