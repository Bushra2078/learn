In this module we explored how we can manage state and events in React. React requires state be immutable, which means we need to replace any stateful values with completely new objects. One way to manage this is through the use of hooks, which give us access to both the state object and a function we can use to update it.

We then saw how we can add events to a component, allowing our user to interact with data on the page. We finished by using the effect hook, which allows us to execute code in response to state being updated.
