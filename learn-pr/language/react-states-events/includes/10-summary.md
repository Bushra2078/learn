In this module, we explored how to manage state and events in React. React requires state to be immutable. So we need to replace stateful values with new objects. One way to manage this process is by using Hooks. Hooks give us access to both the state object and a function we can use to update it.

We also saw how to add events to a component, allowing the user to interact with data on the page. We finished the module by using the Effect Hook to run code in response to an update in state.
