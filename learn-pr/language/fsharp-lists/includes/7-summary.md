In this module, you first learned about collections. There are three main types of collections: lists, arrays, and sequences. Each type has its own purpose. 

You then learned about lists and list properties. Lists are implemented as linked lists, which facilitate accessing items at the start of the list and use a zero-based index.

Finally, you learned about operations in the list module, which allow you to iterate, perform mathematical operations, sort, and much more.
