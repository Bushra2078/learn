Your program usually consists of many different types of data. The idea is to represent data as different types, like string or numbers. But there's also another important type, collections. A collection is more than one piece of data that can be accessed via a named reference. The reason for grouping data in a collection can simply be that, that's how the data looks, like a list of order items or maybe contacts in an address book. 

In F# there's three different data structures you could use to represent collections, each with their own pros and cons and also accompanied by their own methods. The methods that come with these data structures does everything from adding, removing, ordering to perform mathematical operations. You might even find that using a collections method could in some instances replace the need to, for example,  use a loop or event conditional structures like `if...else`. Ultimately it's up to you what you use, but collections are powerful.

In this module, you'll learn about these collection data structures, get introduced to their APIs and some scenarios where to use them.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Explore the collection data structures.
- Understand basic properties on a list structure.
- Use the list module to carry out some more advanced operations.
