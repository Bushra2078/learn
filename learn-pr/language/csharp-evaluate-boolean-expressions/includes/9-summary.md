Our goal was to write code that compares and evaluates equality so we can write more expressive decision statements.

Using various operators and techniques, we wrote code that evaluated equality and compared values to see if one was greater or less than (or equal to) the other. We compared strings, massaging them to create a more accurate comparison that eliminated issues like casing and spaces that might interfere with the result we were hoping for. We learned how to use logical negation to flip a value for comparison, and used the result of methods in our Boolean expressions. Finally, we used the conditional operator to succinctly evaluate a condition and return a result.

Without this full complement of operators and techniques, we'd be limited in the kinds of decision statements we could build. Because all business logic requires some Boolean expressions, we've added a valuable tool to our programming toolbox.
