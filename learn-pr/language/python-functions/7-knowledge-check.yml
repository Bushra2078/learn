  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements is _not_ a good reason to create a function?"
    choices:
    - content: "When you need to encapsulate often-needed functionality in one place."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is incorrect. Encapsulation is actually a great reason to create a function."
    - content: "When you need to help break down a larger problem into smaller, more manageable pieces."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is incorrect. Breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable pieces is actually a great reason to create a function."
    - content: "When you need to share functionality across one or more programs by adding it to a module."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is incorrect. Sharing functionality is actually a great reason to create a function."
    - content: "When you need to store information that will be used throughout your program."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. Storing information isn't a good reason to create a function."
  - content: "How can you make an input argument optional?"
    choices:
    - content: "By adding the **required** keyword."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no **required** keyword."
    - content: "By supplying a default value that should be used if the caller doesn't pass an argument."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "By using keyword arguments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you can use keyword arguments this way, they aren't the right technique to make an argument optional."
    - content: "By checking its value to see if it equals **None**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Your program will throw an error before it reaches any line of code that checks an input parameter for the value **None**."
