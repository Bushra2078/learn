Beyond the fundamental tasks of running tests and generating comprehensive reports, pytest offers a wealth of additional features. 

While not mandatory for test execution or creation, these advanced features can enhance and simplify your testing and enable you to craft more robust tests, expand test coverage, and more efficiently troubleshoot failures.

In this module, you'll learn about features of the pytest framework that will help you write effective tests that are also simple and readable.

## What you will learn

After completing this module, you'll be able to take advantage of a few features of the pytest framework to write better tests. You'll find about how using _parametrize_ in your tests can reduce code repetition while allowing more and better test coverage. You'll also learn about fixtures, which enable sharing common setups and cleanups in tests.

This will allow you to:

- Increase code coverage by adding input values using parametrize
- Build common test code with custom _fixtures_ and avoid code repetition
- Use the _monkeypatch_ fixture to safely invoke code by calling mock functions and setting mock values

## What is the main goal

You should feel empowered by leveraging some of the advanced features of pytest. This will allow you to enhance a test suite, and write new, better, and more powerful tests with improved coverage and more robust tests.
