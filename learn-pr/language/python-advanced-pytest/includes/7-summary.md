In this module, we went through a few advanced features of the Pytest framework. First, we started with _parametrize_, a useful Python decorator that can inject inputs for a single test while treating them as individual tests. Then we covered fixtures, which are reusable test helpers that can clean up automatically. 

Finally, you tried writing tests with _parametrize_ and ported a test class to use a custom fixture for temporary files.

With these Pytest features, you should be able to improve tests by using _parametrize_ and create robust test helpers with fixtures. Extending a test suite with these features or updating an existing test suite allows the following:

- Makes tests easier to read
- Reduces test code with reusable helpers
- Creates granular tests, which improve error reports
- Robust setup and cleanups that happen automatically
