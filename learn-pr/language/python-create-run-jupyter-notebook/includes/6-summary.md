As an astronaut, you need to have a ship's manual on hand to troubleshoot common problems on your spaceship. In this module, you learned how to build an interactive manual by using Jupyter notebooks.

You learned how to:

- Create a Jupyter notebook locally.
- Run a Jupyter notebook by using Python in Visual Studio Code.
- Describe some of the ways to build a notebook.
