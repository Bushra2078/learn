A *notebook* is an interactive environment where you can both write code and document it. Notebooks can also display mathematical computations and charts.

Here, you will create a local *.ipynb* file and run it in Visual Studio Code. The suffix *.ipynb* is used to refer to Jupyter notebooks, which were previously called `iPython notebooks`: `ipynb`.

## Create a notebook

On your local computer, create a file called *ship-manual.ipynb*. You can create the file by using the terminal or command line: type `touch ship-manual.ipynb`. You can also create the file via the command palette in Visual Studio Code, by opening the palette and typing `Jupyter > Create New Blank Notebook`. Open this file in Visual Studio Code. The Jupyter extension should display the file as blank, with the option to add code and Markdown blocks.

## Create a document element in Markdown

At the top of the notebook, you see two options to create two different types of content blocks in the notebook: Markdown and runnable code. Your first task is to create a document title. At the top of the notebook interface in Visual Studio Code, select the plus (**+**) button next to **Markdown**. A box will appear. Add the following Markdown to the box:

`# Ship's Instruction Manual`

## Run your notebook

Now you need to run your notebook. Choose a kernel from the dropdown list on the top right. You might have one or several kernels to choose from, so make sure to choose a Python 3 kernel.

Select the checkbox, and you will find the text is rendered as an `<h1>`, or header text. You just named your notebook! To see how this Markdown file is rendered, choose **run all** from the top of the notebook, or the small arrow to the left of the Markdown box.

## Create runnable code

Now you can add some code to the notebook. Let's add a way to display a widget to start the ship's engine.

First, you need to install a library called [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/?azure-portal=true). Install the library by adding a new code block under the notebook title block. Use Python's package manager, `pip`, to install the library.

1. Add this line to the new code block: `pip install ipywidgets`. 

   ```bash
    pip install ipywidgets
    ```

1. Run this block by using the arrow on the left to install the library.

   You should see `ipywidgets` being installed. Wait for it to finish before continuing.

   Then, create a button right in your notebook that, when pressed, displays a message. 

1. In a new code block, add the following code:

   ```python
   import ipywidgets as widgets

   ignition = widgets.ToggleButton(
       value=False,
       description='Start Engine',
       button_style='success',
       tooltip='Engage your Engine',
       icon='rocket'
   )

   output = widgets.Output()

   display(ignition, output)

   def on_value_change(change):
       with output:
           if change['new'] == True:
               print("engine started!")
           else:   
               print("engine stopped")

   ignition.observe(on_value_change, names='value')

What's going on here? You use the `ipywidget` library to create a button, and listen for its value to change, printing the observed message. Now your manual is starting to look good, and you can start your ship's engine if it stalls!
