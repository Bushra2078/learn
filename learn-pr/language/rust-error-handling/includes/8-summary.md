In this module, you learned:

- How to halt a Rust program in the face of unrecoverable errors by using `panic!`.
- How to represent the possibility of the *absence* of values by using the `Option` enum.
- How to represent operations by using the `Result` enum.
- How to use pattern matching to safely access all possible values of a given type.

In the next module in this learning path, you'll learn about one of Rust's most novel aspects, the *borrow checker*, and how it can prevent many types of bugs in your code.
