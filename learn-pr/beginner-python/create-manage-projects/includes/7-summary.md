In this module, you were introduced to the idea of using libraries written by someone else and how `pip` can be used to both install these libraries and to upgrade or remove them as needed.

Libraries are continuously worked on, and to track that improvement work, different versions of a library is assigned a version number. Different applications on your computer may rely on different versions of the same library.

You were then presented to the concept of a virtual environment. By using a virtual environment, you isolate yourself and your Python project from the rest of the machine.

Within the virtual machine, you bring your own Python runtime and libraries that are installed only within the virtual environment. A benefit to using a virtual environment is therefore that you don't affect other Python projects running on the same machine that needs libraries and Python runtimes of a version that's not compatible to what your project needs.

You were also taught how you can install libraries from a list of libraries and how to upgrade libraries in a responsible way.
