Math will be a part of almost every project you create throughout your journey as a developer. If you're a data scientist, it may be rather complex calculations. If you're creating websites, it might be determining pricing or items in a shopping cart. Python, like any other programming language, provides numerous operators and libraries for performing mathematic operations.

## Scenario

Imagine you're creating a program to calculate the distance between planets. The program will allow a user to enter the distance of two planets from the sun, and it will calculate the distance between one another. Additionally, you want to provide the distance in miles and kilometers.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will explore the core mathematic capabilities of Python. You will learn:

- The mathematic operators available in Python.
- The order of operations.
- How to convert strings to numbers.

## Prerequisites

- Adding and running cells in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Python, including declaring variables and using `input` to read values from a user.
