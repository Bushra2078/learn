As a developer you will frequently work with sets of data. You might need to manage multiple names, ages, or addresses. Storing each value in an individual variable makes code more difficult to read and write. To store multiple values you can use a Python list.

Imagine your a developer who wants to create an application to work with the list of planets. You would like to ask the user for the name of a planet, and display the planets closer to and further away from the sun.

In this module you will learn how to use lists, and some of the most common operations.
