Computer programs are great at dealing with repetitive tasks. As a developer, you'll often find yourself needing to loop over sequences of values, such as strings, numbers, and objects. Python provides two mechanisms for performing such tasks: `while` and `for` loops.

## Scenario: Working with flow control on a planetary app

Imagine you're creating an application where users will enter a list of planet names. After they enter the list, you'll display the results back to them. This will require prompting users multiple times to enter values. When they're done, your code will print out all the data in the list. In this module, we'll explore how you can use `while` and `for` loops to create this application.

By the end of the module, you'll be able to use `for` and `while` loops.

## What will you learn?

After you've completed this module, you'll be able to:
  - Identify when to use `for` and `while` loops.
  - Run a task multiple times by using `while` loops.  
  - Loop over list data by using `for` loops.

## What is the main objective?

In this module, you'll learn how to apply flow control to your app to repeat statements and work with list structures.
