Computer programs are great at dealing with repetitive tasks. You'll often find yourself needing to loop over sequences of values such as strings, numbers, and objects. Python provides two mechanisms for performing a task multiple times - `while` and `for` loops.

Imagine you're creating an application where a user will enter a list of planets. After they've entered the list you will display the results back to them. This will require prompting the user multiple times for values, followed by printing out all the data in the list. We will explore how `while` and `for` loops can be used to create this application.

By the end of the module, you will be able to use `for` and `while` loops.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- identify when to use a for or while
- use `while` to run a task multiple times
- use `for` to loop over list data

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge which includes use of variables, strings, integers and math
- Experience working with dictionaries in Python
- Experience modifying and running code in Jupyter notebooks
