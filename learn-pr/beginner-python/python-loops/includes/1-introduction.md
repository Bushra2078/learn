Computer programs are great at dealing with repetitive tasks. You'll often find yourself needing to loop over sequences of values such as strings, numbers, and objects. Python provides two mechanisms for performing a task multiple times - `while` and `for` loops.

## Scenario: working with flow control on a planetary app

Imagine you're creating an application where a user enters a list of planets. After they enter the list, you'll display the results back to them. This will require prompting the user multiple times for values, followed by printing out all the data in the list. We'll explore how `while` and `for` loops can be used to create this application.

By the end of the module, you'll be able to use `for` and `while` loops.

## What will I learn?

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify when to use `for` or `while`
- Run a task multiple times using `while`
- Loop over list data using `for`

## What is the main objective?

Learn to apply flow control to your app to repeat statements and work with list structures.
