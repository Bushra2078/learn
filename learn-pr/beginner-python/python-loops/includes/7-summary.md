In our scenario we wanted to create an application to prompt a user for a list of planets, store those planets, and display them.

As we didn't know how many planets the user would enter, we used a `while` loop. The `while` loop is used to run a block of code while a condition remains true. We stored each planet in a list.

Once the data was in a list, we used a `for` loop to iterate over it. `for` loops are used with lists and other iterables, where we will run code a known number of times - once for each item in the collection.

In this module, you learned to:

- identify when to use a for or while
- use `while` to run a task multiple times
- use `for` to loop over list data
