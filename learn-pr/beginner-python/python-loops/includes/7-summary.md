In this module, you created an application that prompts users to enter a list of planet names, stores those planet names, and then displays them.

Because you didn't know how many planets users would enter, you used a `while` loop. You use `while` loops to run a block of code while a condition remains true. 

You stored each planet name in a list.

After the planet list was created, you used a `for` loop to iterate over it. You use `for` loops with lists and other iterables, to run code a known number of times, once for each item in the list of planet names.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Identify when to use either a `while` loop or a `for` loop.
- Use a `while` loop to run a task multiple times, as long as a certain condition remains true.
- Use a `for` loop to loop over list data.
