There are many ways to run notebooks. You can run them right within this environment, on Microsoft Learn, and in fact in several of this path's modules you will run notebooks. In this module, however, you will learn how to get setup to run notebooks locally using Visual Studio Code.

In the following video, Cloud Advocate Alfredo Deza explains how to download Python, get setup in Visual Studio Code, and run a notebook locally.

To start building your notebook, you need to have some software available on your computer.

- Python
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio Code Jupyter extension

## Install Python

If you do not have Python installed on your computer, you need to download it. On a Mac, go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/?azure-portal=true) to install the latest version compatible with your operating system. On Windows, go to the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/top-free/apps/pc?category=Developer+tools%5cDevelopment+kits?azure-portal=true) to download the most recent version. If you already have Python installed, you might need to update your installation to the latest version. Make sure you have Python 3 by typing `python3 --version` in your terminal or command line. If it is installed, the version will be displayed.

## Install Visual Studio Code

Next, install Visual Studio Code. Instructions to install Visual Studio Code can be found on this [web site](https://code.visualstudio.com/?azure-portal=true). When complete, configure it to your liking. There are several good videos teaching the best way to set up Visual Studio Code in the [Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos?azure-portal=true).

## Install the Python extension

Once these two installations are complete, you will need to install a Visual Studio Code [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter?azure-portal=true) to allow you to run Jupyter notebooks from within Visual Studio Code using a kernel. 

A [kernel](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)?azure-portal=true) in Visual Studio Code helps you activate an Anaconda environment so you can run your notebooks using your Python installation. Read more about how it works in [this documentation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter?azure-portal=true).

In Visual Studio Code, open the extensions panel in the left navigation and Search Extensions in Marketplace for 'Jupyter' by Microsoft. Install this extension by clicking 'install'.

Now that you have the three elements of your workspace set up, you can start working with Jupyter notebooks in Visual Studio Code.
