Python strings are one of the most common types used in the language. In this module, you learned some of its  properties and the most common methods for manipulation. Finally, you went through examples for formatting using three different techniques:

- The `%` formatter.
- Using `.format()` in a string.
- Using f-strings.

This foundational knowledge will help you with other data structures in Python that work well with strings like dictionaries and lists.
