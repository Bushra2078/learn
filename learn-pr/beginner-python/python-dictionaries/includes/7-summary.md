Most programs require data more complex than string and number values. In our scenario, we were attempting to work with information about the planets in the solar system, which included properties such as the number of moons and circumference.

By using dictionaries, you were able to create a variable to store all related data. You then used `keys` and `values` to interact with the data directly without using key names to perform calculations.

Python dictionaries are flexible objects, allowing you to model complex and related data.
