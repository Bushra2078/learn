You will frequently need to work with more complex data besides strings and Boolean values. Suppose you are creating a program to analyze the number of moons on different planets in the solar system. You want to display information to the user, and be able to calculate different values like the total number of moons in the solar system. Doing this with variables which can only store a string or a number would be tedious.

In this module you will build a program which can perform these types of operations. You will use Python dictionaries to model the data. By the end of the module, you will be able to use Python dictionaries to store complex data.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will be able to:

- identify when to use a dictionary
- create and modify data inside a dictionary
- utilize dictionary methods to access dictionary data

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge which includes use of variables, strings, integers and math
- Experience working with lists in Python
- Experience modifying and running code in Jupyter notebooks
