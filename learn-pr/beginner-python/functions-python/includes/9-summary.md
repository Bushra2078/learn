Python functions help when writing modular and reusable code, compute values, and perform actions given some context. In this module, you learned some of the rules and behavior associated with functions. These rules included dealing with inputs and outputs. Finally, you had the chance to extract and enhance code to make it more readable and maintainable. went through examples for formatting using three different techniques:

These are some of the essentials you now know about functions:

- Functions can require arguments, but can also optionally require them
- When identifying reusable code, it can be extracted and reused in a function
- Variable arguments and variable keyword arguments are useful when the exact inputs aren't known

With these techniques and the knowledge of functions, you should feel more comfortable tackling bigger problems when writing Python.
