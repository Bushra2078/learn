Booleans are a common type in Python. Their value can only ever be one of two things: true or false. Understanding how to use Boolean values is critical, because you'll need them to write *conditional logic*. 

## Scenario: Print warning messages

Suppose you're creating a program that will alert people worldwide that a large, fast asteroid is zooming toward Earth. If the asteroid is close enough to earth to pose a danger, you want to print a warning message on people's devices. If there's no danger, you want to let everyone know that, so they can go on with their day. To be able to provide these messages, you would have to find a way to reason whether a condition is true or false. 

In this module, you'll use Boolean keywords and operators to write several types of conditional expressions.

## What will you learn?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Run code under a variety of conditions by using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.
- Combine conditional logic and create more complex conditions by using `and` and `or` operators.

## What is the main objective?

This module teaches you how to use conditional logic to create decision-driven programs.
