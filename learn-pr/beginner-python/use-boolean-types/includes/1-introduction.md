Booleans are a common type in Python. Their value can only ever be one of two things: true or false. Understanding how to use Boolean values is critical, because you'll need them to write *conditional logic*. 

## Scenario: Print warning messages

Suppose you are creating a program that warns the people of earth if a large, fast asteroid is zooming towards earth. You'd want to print a warning message when the asteroid is large and fast enough, but otherwise, you'd want to let folks go on with their day. To do this, you would have to find a way to reason whether a condition is true or false. 

In this module, you'll use Boolean types to write several types of conditional expressions.

## What will you learn?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Execute code under specific conditions using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.
- Combine conditional logic and create more complex conditions using `and` and `or` operators.

##Â What is the main objective?

Use conditional logic to create decision-driven programs.
