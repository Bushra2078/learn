Test expressions, otherwise known as Boolean expressions, allow you to conditionally execute Python code. They are commonly used in Python to "make decisions" about what should happen next while a program is running. In the previous exercises, we wrote test expressions as part of `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements, and further fine-tuned our conditions using the operators `and` and `or`.

Boolean expressions and statements are a key part of creating complex Python programs, where you can have code run only under certain conditions.

These are some of the essentials you now know about conditional logic:

- Booleans can have one of two values, `True` or `False`.
- `If`, `else`, and `elif` statements can be used to execute code under specific conditions.
- `And` and `or` operators can be used to combine test expressions and create more complex conditions.

With these tools, you should feel ready to write more complex code blocks in Python.
