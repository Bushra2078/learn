    "# Exercise: Use `and` and `or` operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you worked with `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to write programs with complex conditional logic. To create even more interesting Boolean expressions, you can use the `and` and `or` operators in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "`And` expressions are true only if both subexpressions are true. \n",
    "\n",
    "`expression1 and expression2`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Or` expressions are true if *at least* one subexpression is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "`expression1 or expression2`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll learn more nuanced information about when asteroids pose a danger to Earth, and you'll use that information to improve our warning system. Here's the new information you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Asteroids smaller than 25 meters in their largest dimension will most likely burn up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere. \n",
    "* If a piece of an asteroid that's larger than 25 meters but smaller than 1000 meters were to hit Earth, it would cause a lot of damage. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also discussed in the previous exercise that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Asteroid speed varies based on how close it is to the sun, and any speed greater than 25 kilometers per second (km/s) merits a warning.\n",
    "* If an asteroid enters Earth's atmosphere at a speed greater than or equal to 20 km/s, it sometimes produces a streak of light that can be seen from Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using all of this information, write a program that will issue the correct warning or information to the people of Earth, based on an asteroid's speed and size. Use `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements, and use the `and` and `or` operators. \n",
