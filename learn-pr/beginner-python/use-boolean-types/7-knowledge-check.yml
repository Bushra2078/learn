  questions:
  - content: "Under what conditions is a test expression that uses the `and` operator `true`?"
    choices:
    - content: "A test expression uses the `and` operator `true` when both subexpressions are true."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Both conditions in the test expression must be true in order for the entire test expression to be true. "
    - content: "A test expression uses the `and` operator `true` when  one subexpression is true and the other is false."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is true for the `or` operator, but not the `and` operator."
    - content: "A test expression uses the `and` operator `true` when both subexpressions are false."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A test expression uses the `and` operator `true` when both subexpressions are false, the value of the whole test expression is also false."
  - content: "What is the key word `elif` short for in Python?"
    choices:
    - content: "else if"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can use the `elif` key word to add multiple test expressions to your program."
    - content: "only if"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If you want to execute a code block 'only if' a condition is true, you might use an `if` statement."
    - content: "else"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`else` is a separate key word in Python."
  - content: "What values as a test expression are always interpreted as `False`?"
    choices:
    - content: "Any non-zero values."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Some non-zero values may be `False`, depending on the test expression."
    - content: "Empty."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Empty is not a valid Python value."
    - content: "None and 0."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! None and 0 are interpreted as `False` in Python."
