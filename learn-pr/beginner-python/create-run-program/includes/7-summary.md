Throughout the course of this module, you have been made familiar with many new concepts.

You were introduced to the `print()` function that lets you output to the console. Then you looked at variables and how those could be used to store values that you wanted to refer to later in the code. In important part to realize about variables was that a variable must have a type. There are different types in Python that lets you store everything from string, numbers to boolean values.

You also looked at operators, that's used for both arithmetic operations and for assigning values to operators.
