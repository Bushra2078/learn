A common task is developing programs that's able to output information to a screen, a console, but also be able to take input from users or even other programs. In this module, you are looking to build your first programs in Python to learn how to handle input and output on the console. You will also be subjected to concepts you will need to know about such as variables, casting between types and more.

## Scenario: A junior programmer building their first apps

In this scenario, you are a young space cadet on the SS [Sally Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride?azure-portal=true), a spaceship with the mission to find, and explore new solar systems. You train to be an engineer and as such you are looking to develop a series of utility programs for more senior staff onboard. The year is 2203 but it could be 2021.

## Learning objectives

You will learn how to:

- Use functions to manage input and output to the console.
- Create variables to store data.
- Distinguish between different data types.
- Use type conversion to convert between data types.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic programming concepts.
