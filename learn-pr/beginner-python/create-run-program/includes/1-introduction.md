A common task is developing programs that's able to output information to a screen, a console, but also be able to take input from users or even other programs. In this module, you are looking to build your first programs in Python to learn how to handle input and output on the console. You will also be subjected to concepts you will need to know about Python programming aspects, like variables, casting between types, and more.

## Scenario: A junior programmer building your first apps

In this scenario, you are a young space cadet on a spaceship, with the mission to find and explore new solar systems. You train to be an engineer, and as such, you're looking to develop a series of utility programs for more senior staff onboard. The year is sometime in the future.

## What will you learn?

- Use functions to manage input and output to the console.
- Create variables to store data.
- Distinguish between different data types.
- Use type conversion to convert between data types.

## What is the main objective?
