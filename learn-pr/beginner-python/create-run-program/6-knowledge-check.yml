      choices:
        - content: It will evaluate to 3
          isCorrect: false

          explanation: Correct. It will show the error message "cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects".
        - content: I would become "12"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. It would crash. You need to convert the string to an integer for this statement to work. For the answer to become "12", both values would need to be strings "1" + "2".
