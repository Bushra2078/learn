Azure is uniquely designed to align with your business goals and needs by delivering unique value in four key areas: 

- **Productive:** Improve productivity in your business and with your developers.
- **Hybrid:** Take advantage of the flexibility that the Azure hybrid cloud provides. 
- **Intelligent:** Gain insights and build intelligence into all your solutions.
