The taxi industry, for instance, has been fundamentally transformed by the introduction of digitally-powered, ride-on-demand services. Whether you're looking to
migrate to the cloud or consider yourself a cloud-native company, Azure delivers unique value that helps keep you ahead of your competition.

As the video shows, using the power of Azure to apply intelligence and improve decision-making can fundamentally transform your business. Azure provides unique
value in four areas, which we explore next.

## Why Azure?

When it’s time to find solutions to achieve your business objectives, Azure allows you to build on a platform that you can trust, that will grow with you, and 
that provides the flexibility to design a solution around your specific capabilities and business objectives. This all happens regardless of your company’s 
approach to the cloud: on-premises, cloud only, or hybrid.

To help meet your digital transformation goals, Azure is built on four unique values (or promises):
* **be future ready**
* **build on your terms**
* **operate hybrid seamlessly**
* **trust your cloud**

Microsoft will be a partner with you throughout your digital transformation journey. We have additional training to help you learn more, and tools to help you
determine where you are today and then outline your next steps.
