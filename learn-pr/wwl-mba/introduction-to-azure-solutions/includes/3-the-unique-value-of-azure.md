Azure is designed to align with your business goals and needs by delivering unique value in four key areas: 

- **Be future ready**: Capabilities you need today but more added continuously to meet your needs tomorrow and beyond.
- **Build on your terms**: Developers can build with the frameworks, languages, tools, and Open Source software they want. 
- **Operate hybrid seamlessly**: Seamlessly operate technology on-premises, in the cloud, and sitting on Edge devices.
- **Trust your cloud**: Build and deploy on a platform you can trust - secure and compliant.

The value that Azure provides across these four areas ensures that your adoption of the cloud is successful starting on day one, and in the future.
