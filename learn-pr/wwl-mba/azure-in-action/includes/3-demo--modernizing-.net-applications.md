Tailwind Traders is a local retail company. They are in the process of expanding their business worldwide and, in order to do that, they need to scale their applications with robust solutions that allow them to reach more customers without worrying about their application performance.

The process by which Tailwind Traders can host their Rewards application in **Azure App Service** and modernize it with **Azure Logic Apps** has been separated into three segments as illustrated by the following animation:

>Once an application is running in Azure App Service, administrators can take advantage of the many benefits available. Just a few of the options that can be configured using Azure App Service are:
>- Application authentication or authorization - Fully control access to an app by activating authentication providers such as Microsoft Live ID, Facebook, Google, Twitter, or even put it behind an active directory tenant.
>- Networking - Connect to on-premises resources, such as a database, and fully customize security, using networking policy to define how traffic and data flows through an app.
>- Scale up - Increase the size of an instance by adding more resources.
>- Scale out - Increase the number of instances running.
>- Diagnostics monitoring - Get real-time insights using alerts, logs, and performance testing.

## Modernize

**Azure Logic Apps** simplifies the creation of automated scalable workflows that integrate apps and data across cloud services and on-premises systems.
