## Introduction

When an application is outgrowing the local infrastructure on which it is hosted, you need to look at other options to meet those growing demands. The Azure cloud offers a number of platforms and service offerings to host the applications.

Tailwind Traders is a local retail company. They are in the process of expanding their business worldwide and, in order to do that, they need to scale their applications with robust solutions that allow them to reach more customers without worrying about their application performance.

In this demo you will see the process by which Tailwind Traders can host their Rewards application in **Azure App Service** and modernize it with **Azure Logic.**

You have just seen how easy it is to migrate an application using Azure App Service and then update it without any code using Azure Logic Apps. Automation of manual tasks like this one will allow Tailwind Traders to scale, making it possible for them to expand their business.

### Key points

- Azure offers tools and capabilities that simplify the process of migrating your existing workloads to the cloud, where you can immediately take advantage of cloud scale and elasticity and easily modernize to align to changing business goals.

- **Azure App Service** provides a way to easily migrate applications to Azure using the publishing tools available in Visual Studio, a very common development tool that can automatically create necessary resources such as an **Azure SQL Database**.

- Once an application is running in **Azure App Service**, administrators can take advantage of the many available benefits. Just a few of the options that can be configured using **Azure App Service** are:

  - Application authentication or authorization - Fully control access to an app by activating authentication providers such as Microsoft Live ID, Facebook, Google, Twitter, or even put it behind an active directory tenant.

  - Networking - Connect to on-premises resources, such as a database, and fully customize security, using networking policy to define how traffic and data flows through an app.

  - Scale up - Increase the size of an instance by adding more resources.

  - Scale out - Increase the number of instances running.

- **Azure Logic Apps** makes it possible to modernize an application without modifying the production code, offering opportunities to automate and scale with minimal disruption and simplifying the creation of workflows that integrate apps and data across cloud services and on-premises systems.

Now that you've experienced Azure in action, let's complete the knowledge check.
