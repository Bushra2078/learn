Welcome to the Azure demonstration module. This module allows you to *see* how Azure can be used to solve some of the most common challenges in moving to the cloud. You will see two demos. Each demo has been broken into short segments that focus on specific capabilities of the products.

The demonstrations in this module show you the ease with which you can adopt Azure, as well as some of the benefits of running your solutions on Azure. Specific tools are available within Azure to aid in the process of migrating to the cloud, modernizing your solutions using new cloud capabilities, and even continuously monitoring and updating your solutions in the cloud.  

A key time to consider migration and modernization to Azure is when your business is on the verge of an expansion or upgrade. For instance, maybe your server hardware or software is reaching the end of its lifecycle, or you need to add capacity to your data center. These can be opportune moments to consider the cloud as part of your new or upgraded infrastructure.

> [!NOTE]
> Extended support ends for Windows Server 2008/2008 R2 on January 14, 2020 and for SQL Server 2008/2008 R2 on July 9, 2019, making this a good time to evaluate new options for innovation and modernization with cloud technologies.

The demos in this module provide an opportunity to see and show Azure in action.

In this module, you will:

- Review an application server lift and shift migration demo using Azure Migrate.

- Watch a demo that shows how to modernize an application using Azure Logic Apps.

- Recognize the value of Azure as illustrated by these demos.

Next, let's review an example of a lift and shift Azure migration demo.
