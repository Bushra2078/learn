Many organizations are eager to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing by migrating their existing applications and workloads from their on-premises datacenters to the cloud. The competitive advantages of higher efficiency, greater flexibility, lower costs, and better performance are attractive, but it can be daunting to know where to start.

The demonstrations in this module will show you the ease with which you can adopt Azure, as well as the benefits of running your solutions on Azure. Specific tools are available within Azure to aid not only the process of migrating to the cloud, but also modernizing your solutions using new cloud capabilities, and even continuously monitoring and updating your solutions in the cloud.  

A key time to consider the cloud is when your business is on the verge of an expansion or upgrade. For instance, maybe your server hardware is reaching the end of its lifecycle, or you need to add capacity to your data center. These can be opportune moments to consider the cloud as part of your new or upgraded infrastructure. And as extended support ends for workloads on Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 on January 14, 2020, now is the time to evaluate new options that help you innovate and modernize with cloud technologies. The demos in this module provide an opportunity to see and show Azure in action.

In this module, you will:

- Review a lift and shift Azure migration demo.

- Watch a demo that shows how to modernize an application using Azure Logic Apps.

- Observe a demo that shows automation and integration benefits of Azure DevOps.

- Recognize how Azure differentiators help solve business challenges.
