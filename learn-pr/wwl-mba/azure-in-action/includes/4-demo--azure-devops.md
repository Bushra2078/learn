## Introduction

Microsoft provides the only comprehensive DevOps solution that spans from development to project management to deployment to operations.

In this demo, we will explore the integration and automation benefits of Azure DevOps. Contoso Air relies on their flagship website to generate and manage business opportunities. Currently, Contoso Air is unable to update their application software fast enough. The current processes they have in place to move a change from their source code to their production systems is time-consuming and open to human error.

They need to automate the integration and delivery process so that they can spin up all the infrastructure needed to deploy and host the application without any manual intervention.

To improve operations, a Contoso Air DevOps Engineer implements pipelines for continuous integration and continuous delivery to enable them to quickly update their public services and take advantage of the full benefits of DevOps and the cloud.

We will take on the role of helping Contoso Air move to a DevOps practice.

Let’s see how.

By integrating Azure DevOps, you can deliver value at a faster speed.

Now, let's learn how you can implement a pipeline for any application.

## Setting up automated CI/CD pipelines with Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines helps you implement a build, test, and deployment pipeline for any application.

In this demo segment, you'll see how Azure Pipelines enables you to:

- install Azure Pipelines with GitHub Marketplace

- configure a CI pipeline

- embed automated tests in the CI pipeline

- configure a CD pipeline with Azure Pipelines

Contoso Air uses GitHub to manage their source code and they host their production site on Azure.

Follow along as the Contoso Air DevOps Engineer revamps a critical component of this DevOps scenario—setting up automated CI/CD pipelines with Azure Pipelines.

Azure Pipelines allows you to configure and manage continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for the application and platform of your choice. But deploying the application is not the end of the process.

Let’s continue our demo to learn how to detect issues with Application Insights.

## Using Application Insights

With Application Insights, you can quickly find out how your app is performing and being used when it's live. If there's a problem, it lets you know about it, helps you assess the impact, and helps you determine the cause.

In this demo segment, you'll see how Application Insights enables you to:

- detect issues before your users do

- triage issues

- diagnose the cause of the issues

When Contoso Air releases a new feature or improvement, they need to observe how well it works for their users. They want to know how their app is performing so they can plan the next iteration of development based on that knowledge. The Contoso Air website is the lifeline of the company, and they can’t let it go down.

Follow along as the Contoso Air DevOps Engineer uses Application Insights to detect issues before their users do.

Application Insights allows you to monitor your application and receive alerts when the application becomes unavailable, experiences failures, or suffers from performance issues.

The application map configuration enables you to create a bug automatically in Azure DevOps whenever an error is generated in the application. Captured data can be stored as metadata or you can link artifacts with the bug, so your teams can identify the root cause and make fixes quickly.

Next, we’ll continue our solution demo to learn more about Azure Boards.

## Managing GitHub Projects with Azure Boards

With Azure Boards, you can plan, track, and discuss work across your teams.

In this demo segment, you’ll see how Azure Boards enables you to:

- connect GitHub with Azure Boards

- connect GitHub repository to Azure Boards

- commit to complete a task

Contoso Air wants to track what their teams are working on. They find it hard to gauge current commitments and plan for future projects.

Follow along as the Contoso Air DevOps Engineer uses Azure Boards to track projects.

Track your work with Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom reporting.

## Conclusion

Azure Pipelines enables you to continuously build, test, and deploy to any platform or cloud. In addition to Azure Pipelines, GitHub users can also benefit from Azure Boards, a set of features that enable you to plan, track, and discuss work across your teams using Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom reporting. And with the Application Insights feature, you get visibility into how your application is running once it’s released.

### Key takeaways

The key takeaways of the demo are:

- Microsoft provides the only comprehensive DevOps solution that spans from development to project management to deployment to operations.

- It doesn't matter what technologies or processes you're using---even setting up a Node.js solution on GitHub to deploy to a Linux container that connects to a Cosmos DB is a seamless, straightforward experience.

- Azure offers a practical approach to automation at every step of the DevOps lifecycle that enables companies to focus their efforts on creating business value.
