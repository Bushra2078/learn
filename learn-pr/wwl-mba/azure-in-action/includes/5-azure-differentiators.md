For organizations that have made the decision to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing, the question becomes:

### Which cloud?

Whether your organization is just getting started with the cloud or looking to expand cloud service capabilities, Azure can help you meet your business challenges.

With datacenters in more regions than any other cloud provider, Azure provides the **global** reach with local presence that many organizations need, allowing them to reduce the cost, the time, and the complexity of operating a global infrastructure while meeting local data residency needs.

Azure is **Productive**, allowing organizations to develop using any tool, language, or framework they want and providing access to 100+ services with great end-to-end tools to enable organizations to be successful.

Azure offers the broadest set of **Hybrid** capabilities of any cloud provider. Azure provides a consistent experience both in the cloud and on-premises, as well as a comprehensive view across both environments.

Azure is **Intelligent**, providing the opportunity to achieve more with a leading set of modern artificial intelligence (AI) services, tools, and enterprise-grade infrastructure that allow organizations to run their AI workloads from anywhere at scale.

Azure is **Trusted**, with more certifications than any other cloud provider. Azure is a leader in privacy, compliance, and security—making it possible for organizations to build and migrate applications and infrastructure with peace of mind.
