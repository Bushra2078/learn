The starting point for data analysis using HDInsight is creating an HDInsight cluster. Once this is complete, you will be able to perform a range of activities from reading data to performing as-hoc analytical operations. Furthermore, you can monitor the performance of your cluster once it is operational so that you can establish baseline performance and troubleshoot any issues. In this module you will: 

1. Create an HDInsight Spark Cluster
1. Execute queries on an HDInsight Spark Cluster
1. Monitor an HDInsight Spark Cluster
1. Learn how to fix common provisioning issue
