The starting point for data analysis using HDInsight is creating an HDInsight cluster. Once this step is complete, you can perform a range of activities from reading data to doing ad-hoc analytical operations. Then, you can monitor the performance of your cluster once it is operational and establish baseline performance and troubleshoot issues. In this module you will: 
   
- Create an HDInsight Spark Cluster 
- Execute queries on an HDInsight Spark Cluster
- Monitor an HDInsight Spark Cluster
- Learn how to fix common provisioning issues
