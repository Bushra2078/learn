Insights are uncovered from the telemetry data of connected IoT devices, processed by backend systems. These insights can be transformed into powerful processes and services that help you improve operational and business performance.

Many industries can benefit by innovating with IoT. Currently, businesses that identify with IoT include:

- Manufacturing
- Transportation and logistics
- Energy and natural resources
- Agriculture
- Retail
- Government
- Healthcare
- Financial services
- Smart spaces management

### Azure IoT solutions applied across industries

Azure IoT solutions tend to be horizontal, and can span multiple industries. Industry experts may use different terminology to describe IoT applications, but the're generally referring to the five common scenarios listed below. Later in the module, we'll also review how these solutions can be applied with Azure IoT services.

|Scenario|Description|Industry Example|
|----------|-----------|----------|
|**Remote monitoring**|Remote monitoring is the foundation for all IoT solutions. It helps to monitor products and systems to collect performance data and diagnose issues remotely. | Remote monitoring solutions of freight or equipment in the logistics industry help to reduce servicing costs, improve up-time, and increase user satisfaction. |
|**Predictive maintenance**|Predictive maintenance is a power use case that is common for device manufacturers. The solution monitors the condition of in-service equipment to determine when maintenance should be performed. At its core, this is remote monitoring and machine learning. | The manufacturing industry utilizes predictive maintenance to monitor equipment for early signs that maintenance is required. Early signs might be increasing vibration, or temperature. This warning enables equipment to be checked, and repaired if need be, before failure. |
|**Facilities management**|Facilities management optimizes usage, user experience, and energy consumption in any facility. The primary goal is cost reduction. The Digital Twin feature of an Azure IoT Hub provides the capabilities to manage _recorded_ and _desired_ device settings. These two settings enable the fine control of devices, that enables effective facilities management. | The energy industry uses facilities management, combined with remote monitoring, to manage energy usage to optimize performance, and effectively reduce costs. |
|**Connected manufacturing**|Connected manufacturing is the ability to manage production lines, or other similar applications, using embedded IoT devices and sensors. | The renewable energy industry uses real-time performance monitoring of solar panel production lines. This monitoring improves efficiency, both through preventative maintenance, and also failure prediction enabling controlled shutdowns. This solution is the combination of remote monitoring and predictive maintenance, with added support from industrial equipment. The solution enables a lot of equipment to work together securely. |
|**Fleet management**|Fleet management is the ability to monitor a fleet of vehicles with location-aware sensors. These vehicles can be planes, trains, ships, drones, trucks, cars, forklifts, etc. |  The transportation industry uses real-time visibility to track location and speed of vehicles. This tracking results in fewer insurance claims, and lower fuel costs. This example is sometimes referred to as a "connected" or "smart vehicle solution". |

### How Azure IoT works for preventative maintenance and analytics

With preventative maintenance and stream analytics through IoT, you can set conditions that, if met, will trigger actions. These actions can preemptively prevent equipment from failing. In addition, you can translate insights from the streaming data to identify operational changes. Not failure prevention, but improvements in performance.
