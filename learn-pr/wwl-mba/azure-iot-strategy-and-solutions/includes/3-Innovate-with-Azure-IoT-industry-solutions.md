Insights are uncovered from telemetry data during the data processing by the backend systems. These insights can be transformed into powerful processes and services, that help you improve operational and business performance.

Many industries can benefit by innovating with IoT. Currently, businesses working with IoT include:

- Manufacturing
- Transportation and logistics
- Energy and natural resources
- Agriculture
- Retail
- Government
- Healthcare
- Financial services
- Smart buildings, and smart cities

### Azure IoT solutions applied across industries

Azure IoT solutions tend to be horizontal, and can span multiple industries. Industry experts may use different terminology to describe IoT applications, but they are generally referring to the five common scenarios listed below. Later in the module, we'll also review how these solutions can be applied with Azure IoT services.

|Scenario|Description|Industry Example|
|----------|-----------|----------|
|**Remote monitoring**|Remote monitoring is the foundation for all IoT solutions. Sensors in embedded devices send continuous telemetry data to the cloud, for monitoring. | In the retail industry, remote monitoring enables in-store analytics, and smart inventory management. For government, issues like water quality, connected waste management, and weather monitoring, can be addressed effectively. In healthcare, the continuous monitoring of patients can be managed remotely.|
|**Predictive maintenance**|Predictive maintenance is a power use case, and is a priority for many device manufacturers. The solution monitors the condition of in-service equipment to determine when maintenance should be done. At its core, this scenario is a combination of remote monitoring and machine learning. | The manufacturing industry uses predictive maintenance to monitor equipment for early signs that maintenance is required. Early signs might be increasing, or irregular, vibration, or temperature. This warning enables equipment to be checked, and repaired if need be, before failure. |
|**Facilities management**|Facilities management optimizes usage, user experience, and energy consumption in any facility. The Digital Twin feature of an Azure IoT Hub provides the capabilities  to manage _recorded_ and _desired_ device settings. These two settings enable the fine control of devices, and enable effective facilities management. Another feature is remote security.| The energy industry uses facilities management, combined with remote monitoring, to optimize energy usage. In agriculture, the environment of refrigerated storage, wine cellars, and cheese caves, can be monitored and adjusted. In a smart building, access can be controlled, perhaps making use of an AI-based recognition technology.|
|**Connected manufacturing**|Connected manufacturing is the ability to manage production lines, or other similar applications, using embedded IoT devices and sensors. | The renewable energy industry uses real-time performance monitoring of solar panel production lines. This monitoring improves efficiency, both through preventative maintenance, and also failure prediction, enabling controlled shutdowns. This solution is the combination of remote monitoring and predictive maintenance, with added support from industrial equipment. The solution enables a lot of equipment to work together securely, aiding workplace safely and quality control. |
|**Fleet management**|Fleet management is the ability to monitor a fleet of vehicles with location-aware sensors. These vehicles can be planes, trains, ships, drones, trucks, cars, forklifts, and so on. |  The transportation industry uses real-time visibility to track location and speed of vehicles. This tracking results in fewer insurance claims, and lower fuel costs. This example is sometimes referred to as a "connected" or "smart vehicle solution". |

### How Azure IoT works for preventative maintenance and analytics

With preventative maintenance and stream analytics through IoT, you set conditions that, if met, will trigger actions. These actions, if done quickly, prevent equipment from failing. Also, you can translate insights from the streaming data to identify operational changes. In this case, not for failure prevention, but for improvements in performance.
