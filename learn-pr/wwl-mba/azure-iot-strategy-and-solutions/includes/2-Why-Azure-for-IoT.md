Microsoft Azure IoT helps simplify your business journey through connected devices, so you can accelerate your business transformation. You can leverage the skills, technology, and resources you already have to create an IoT solution tailored to your business. Your solution can easily capture new data from your connected devices, and then create valuable insights. For example, companies in the oil and gas industry have overcome challenges related to monitoring a vast number of widely dispersed field assets by using Azure IoT to digitally collect, store, and analyze data. These connected devices help companies gain insight into optimizing oil, or gas, well operations, and identify future drilling locations.

With Azure IoT, you can build intelligence across your organization by bringing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to the edge, leading to faster predictions, smarter actions, and a secure and trusted platform.

### Business Challenges

For organizations across all industries, Azure IoT can help solve a common set of business challenges, to fuel innovation and digital transformation.

|Business Challenge |Business Challenge Description |Why Microsoft and Azure IoT?|
|----------|-----------|-----------|
|**Complexity** | IoT implementation and operations can be complex because of changing requirements, technology updates, business expansion, and security requirements. This complexity can impact business operations. | Azure IoT reduces complexity with Azure IoT Central, a SaaS (software-as-a-service) offering to get up and running quickly with IoT, and solutions accelerators for developing custom IoT for the most common use cases (for example, remote monitoring, predictive maintenance). |
|**Cost** | Implementing an IoT solution can be expensive. The biggest concern is understanding the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), and the ROI (Return on Investment) of the implementation.  | With Azure IoT, customers can choose a fully managed or finished solution from a partner.  The other option is a fully managed SaaS offering with per device pricing that makes the cost to start and upgrade clear and predictable over a fully customized solution. |
|**Security** |  Without proper planning and oversight, IoT can be prone to security vulnerabilities in areas like device control and data privacy.   | Azure IoT is built for security with an end-to-end approach to maintain control and trust for data, devices, and applications with Azure Security Center support for end-to-end IoT deployments. |

### What does an Azure IoT architecture look like?

The diagram illustrates a recommended IoT solution architecture that is cloud native, microservices, and serverless-based.

[![Azure IoT reference architecture illustration](../media/ic-gm07-diagram.png)](../media/ic-gm07-diagram.png#lightbox)

An IoT application consists of the following subsystems:

1. **Devices** that can securely register with the cloud, and send telemetry data. Alternatively, multiple devices might communicate with an edge gateway, and the edge gateway communicate with the cloud. The devices, or the edge gateway, have connectivity options for exchanging data with the cloud.

1. A cloud gateway service, or **hub**, to securely read the incoming data, and provide some device management capabilities.

1. **Stream processors** that consume the telemetry data, integrate with **business processes**, and place the data into **storage**.

1. A **user interface** to visualize data, and enable easy device management.
