quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which common IoT challenges do customers often face that Azure IoT can help address? "
    choices:
    - content: "Cost, complexity, and security"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure IoT has a comprehensive set of solutions that help customers reduce costs, simplify complexity, and mitigate security concerns."
    - content: "Complexity, security, and flexibility"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While Azure IoT does offer flexibility across hybrid and cloud environments, this feature is not one of the common business challenges that customers face."
    - content: "Cost and security"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cost and security are certainly challenges, but there is a better answer."
    - content: "Cost and complexity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cost and complexity are certainly challenges, but there is a better answer."

  - content: "Which of the following descriptions best describes how IoT works?"
    choices:
    - content: "A microcontroller unit (MCU) embedded in a connected device, either alongside or in place of existing MCUs. The embedded MCU enhances security, productivity, and opportunity for product manufacturers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This description might apply well to Azure Sphere."
    - content: "Remote monitoring helps maintain the health of your solution by tracking events such as device creation, failures, and connections."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT Hub is a managed service that allows you to monitor the health of your solution. However, there is a better answer to this question."
    - content: "Real-time data and alerts that streamline logistics and decision-making."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT does enable real-time data, and alerts, to streamline logistics. However, there is a better answer to this question."
    - content: "A set of things, connected to the Internet, collects insights that then enable people or machines to take actions based on data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "IoT is a network of Internet connected devices. These devices communicate embedded sensor data to the cloud. Once data is collected, it becomes possible to analyze it, and gain meaningful, actionable insights."
  
  - content: "Which IoT subsystem consumes data, integrates with business processes, and places the data in storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "IoT devices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT devices collect data, and sends the data to the cloud."
    - content: "Cloud gateway service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A cloud gateway service, or hub, securely accepts data from devices and provides device management capabilities."
    - content: "Stream processors"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Stream processors consume that data from IoT devices, integrate with business processes, and place the data into storage."
    - content: "User interface"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A user interface visualizes telemetry data, and facilitates device management."

  - content: "What are the most common IoT solutions used across industries?"
    choices:
    - content: "IoT devices, stream processors, cloud gateways, storage, UI reporting and tools, and business integration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These components are IoT subsystems, not solutions."
    - content: "Remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, facilities management, connected manufacturing, and fleet management"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "These IoT solutions are currently the most commonly used."
    - content: "Empower employees, engage customers, optimize operations, and transform products"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These goals are the digital transformation pillars that may be enabled by IoT, but they are not IoT solutions."
    - content: "Cloud migration, application modernization, microservices, serverless computing, and DevOps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These processes are components of application migration and modernization, not IoT solutions."
