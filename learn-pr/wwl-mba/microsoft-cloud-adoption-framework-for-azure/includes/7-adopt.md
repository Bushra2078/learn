At this point, you have established your business justification and defined your business outcomes. You have prepared your organization. Your people and your Azure environment are ready to deploy your prioritized applications. You are ready to adopt cloud technologies following the selected digital estate rationalization path.

Any balanced technology portfolio has a mixture of applications in various states. Some applications are scheduled for retirement and given minimal support. Other applications or assets are supported in a maintenance state, but the features of those solutions are stable. For newer business processes, changing market conditions will likely spur ongoing feature enhancements or modernization. When opportunities to drive new revenue streams arise, new applications are introduced into the environment. At each stage of an application’s lifecycle, the impact any investment has on revenue and profit will change. The later the lifecycle stage, the less likely a new feature or modernization effort will yield a strong return on investment.

As discussed, your organization will have unique motivations to adopt the cloud. However, they all converge into "migration" or "innovation" to the cloud. The **migrate** journey is focused, largely, on completing a migration of existing on-premises applications to the cloud. And the **innovation** journey is frequently linked to migration since it is common for those migrated applications to undergo modernization efforts to drive business and product innovation.

## Cloud Migrate

Cloud migration is the process of moving existing digital assets to a cloud platform. Existing assets are replicated to the cloud with minimal modifications. Once an application or workload becomes operational in the cloud, users are transitioned from the existing solution to the cloud solution. Cloud migration is one way to effectively balance a cloud portfolio. This is often the fastest and most agile approach in the short term. Conversely, some benefits of the cloud may not be realized without additional future modification. Enterprises and mid-market customers use this approach to accelerate the pace of change, avoid planned capital expenditures, and reduce ongoing operational costs.

The strategy and tools you use to migrate an application to Azure will largely depend on your business motivations, technology strategies, and timelines, as well as a deep understanding of the actual application and assets (infrastructure, apps, and data) being migrated. This decision tree serves as high-level guidance for selecting the best tools to use based on migration decisions. 

To guide incremental execution during the transition to the end state, this model separates migration into two areas of focus.

**Migration preparation**: Establish a rough migration backlog based largely on the current state and desired outcomes.

- **Business outcomes** - The key business objectives driving this migration (defined in Plan stage).

- **Digital estate estimate** - A rough estimate of the number and condition of workloads to be migrated (defined in Plan stage).

- **Roles and responsibilities** - A clear definition of the team structure, separation of responsibilities, and access requirements (defined in Ready stage).

- **Change management requirements** - The cadence, processes, and documentation required to review and approve changes (defined in Ready stage).

These initial inputs shape the migration backlog for the cloud adoption journey. The output of the migration backlog is a prioritized list of applications to migrate to the cloud. That list shapes the execution of the cloud migration process. Over time, it will also grow to include much of the documentation needed to manage change.

**Migration process**: Each cloud migration activity is contained in one of the following processes, as it relates to the migration backlog.

- **Assess** - Evaluate an existing asset and establish a plan for migration of the asset.

- **Migrate** - Replicate the functionality of an asset in the cloud.

- **Optimize** - Balance the performance, cost, access, and operational capacity of a cloud asset.

- **Secure and manage** - Ensure a cloud asset is ready for ongoing operations.

## Cloud Innovate

Modern approaches to infrastructure deployment, operations, and governance are rapidly bridging the gaps between development and operations. Establishing environment factories with common templates for various application patterns allows IT and operations teams to accelerate deployment while reducing risks. Integration of operations frees DevOps from maintenance of configuration drift, security baseline implementation, operational monitoring, and other IT services. Modernization and innovation in the IT portfolio create tighter alignment with DevOps, accelerating innovations across the digital estate and application portfolio.

Cloud-native apps and data accelerate development and experimentation cycles. Older apps can take advantage of many of the same cloud-native benefits by modernizing the solution or components of the solution. Modern DevOps and SDLC approaches that use cloud technology shorten the time from idea to product change. Combined, these tools invite the customer into the process to create shorter feedback loops and better customer experiences.

Now that you have learned how to plan, get ready to start deploying your first applications to the cloud. Next let’s talk about operating in the cloud.

Here are the key points from this module:

- Cloud migration is the process of moving existing digital assets to a cloud platform. The Cloud Adoption Framework separates migration into two areas of focus: migration preparation and migration process.

- Each cloud migration activity is contained during one of the following processes, as it relates to the migration backlog: assess, migrate, optimize, and secure and manage each backlog asset.

- Modernization and innovation in the IT portfolio create tighter alignment with DevOps, accelerating innovations across the digital estate and application portfolio.
