How the cloud can advance your business strategy depends on your situation. The cloud delivers fundamental technology benefits that can aid in executing multiple business strategies. Using cloud-based approaches can improve basic business agility, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and even allow businesses to quickly expand into new markets.

However, as your organization moves forward in your cloud adoption journey, proper planning is key to your success. Since your organization has already technology investments you must start by understanding your current state, and then defining a prioritization plan for your cloud journey. In this stage, focus on two main actions:

- **Rationalize your digital estate**: understand the organization's current digital estate to maximize return and minimize risks, by running a Workload Assessment.

- **Create your cloud adoption plan**: define a plan where prioritized workloads are defined and aligned with business outcomes.

## Rationalize your digital estate

A digital estate is the collection of IT assets that power business processes and supporting operations. That all starts with an inventory and measurement of the digital assets the organization owns today. Then, proper evaluation of such assets to determine the best way to migrate or modernize each asset to the cloud is what’s called ‘cloud rationalization’.

You may also hear cloud rationalization referred to as the “Five Rs”. During this process, it is recommended to manage this process ‘incrementally’, application by application, and not making too broad or too early decisions across the entire Application Portfolio.

There are 5 options for cloud rationalization:

Also known as a "lift and shift" migration, a rehost effort moves a current state asset to the chosen cloud provider, with minimal change to overall architecture.

- Reducing capital expense
- Freeing up datacenter space
- Achieving rapid return on investment in the cloud

Refactor also refers to the application development process of refactoring code to allow an application to deliver on new business opportunities.

- Faster and shorter updates.

When aging applications are not compatible with the cloud, they may need to be rearchitected to produce cost and operational efficiencies in the cloud.

Unsupported, misaligned or too old applications on premises are too expensive to carry forward, a new code based created to align with cloud-native approach could be the appropriate and efficient path to follow.

Sometimes, the best technology and approach available is to simply replace the current application with a hosted application that meets all functionality required, in the cloud.

Collectively, these 5 Rs of rationalization can be applied to a digital estate to make rationalization decisions regarding the future state of each application.

Because every application is unique, there’s no single set of steps to follow for cloud rationalization. That's why it's important to conduct a Workload Assessment to identify which applications would require minor changes in code, and which need a complete redesign to make them cloud-ready. Most importantly, during this assessment each application is assessed against the broader portfolio, prioritizing each application’s value and creating a plan for each one’s future use. Based on that information wise decisions can be made about each workload and the investments to be made in each. Choosing the right approach for the various workloads in an Application Portfolio can help extract maximum value from cloud-enabled and innovative technologies.

## Remove rationalization roadblocks

Full cloud rationalization (choosing one of the five Rs) requires a combination of quantitative analysis (numbers-based analysis) and qualitative analysis (factor in human intelligence and collective, organizational knowledge). Qualitative analysis is the risky part of rationalization, as it requires alignment of number of stakeholders. Those stakeholders will have different perspectives on the priority, time commitment, and importance of the rationalization effort, especially during early planning. Securing time for the necessary feedback from those stakeholders commonly creates time consuming roadblocks.

To remove rationalization as a roadblock to migration, the CAF methodology suggests an Incremental Rationalization approach. In this approach, the five Rs are initially reduced to one of two Rs. If the cloud adoption motivations are aligned to Migration motivations, a Rehost rationalization is applied to all workloads. If motivations are aligned to Innovation motivations, a refactor rationalizations is applied. Having one initial rationalization allows for initial business planning based on a documented assumption that will later be tested. During the Migration implementation an assessment process will evaluate these assumptions on a per workload basis. The work of rationalization still has to happen, but it is treated like a late-bound technical decision to remove this sticky decision as a roadblock to migration.

> [!TIP]
> The traditional approach to rationalization attempts to boil the ocean. Fortunately, a plan for every application is often not required to start a transformation journey. In an incremental model, the Power of 10 provides a good starting point. In this model, select the first ten applications to be migrated. Those ten applications should contain a mixture of simple and complex applications.

## Create your cloud adoption plan

The cloud delivers fundamental technology benefits that can aid in executing multiple business strategies. Using cloud-based approaches can improve basic business agility, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and even allow businesses to quickly expand into new markets. To take advantage of the cloud's potential, it is important to start by documenting the business strategy in a way that is understandable to cloud technicians and also palatable to business stakeholders.

**Creating a financial model that accurately represents the full business value of any cloud transformation can be complicated. Financial models and business justifications tend to vary between different organizations.**

While developing a business justification model for your organization's cloud journey, it’s important to identify business outcomes that can then be mapped to specific cloud capabilities and business strategies to reach the desired state of transformation. Then, documenting all these outcomes and business strategies will served as the foundation for your organization’s cloud adoption plan. Key steps to build this plan are:

- Review sample business outcomes. Identify any business outcomes that directly align with the targeted business strategy. Document those in the provided business outcome template to share with internal partners during the transformation journey.

- Identify the learning metrics that would best represent progress toward the identified business outcomes. It may be necessary to engage the CIO, or members of the IT team, to select relevant metrics based on the current environment.

- Establish a financial model that aligns with the outcomes and learning metrics.

- Document and incorporate the digital estate in the current environment to populate the financial model. This will establish investment criteria, time to break even, and return on investment (ROI).
