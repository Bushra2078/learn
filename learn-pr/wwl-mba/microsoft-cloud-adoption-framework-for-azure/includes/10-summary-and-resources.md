Moving to the cloud is a complex undertaking. It requires the alignment of senior business leaders on the business value of making the move. They must then create an effective cloud adoption strategy that will be adopted by employees. The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework can help your business easily identify when to move to the cloud, how to create an effective migration strategy, and which approach to technology migration and modernization your business should take.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Leverage the Cloud Adoption Framework to identify where you are in the digital transformation journey.

- Identify triggers and opportunities for cloud adoption.

- Recognize the components needed to develop a digital transformation strategy around your business, people, and technology.

:::column:::
- The three main components of the Cloud Adoption Framework —plan, ready, and adopt—can be applied to different stages for cloud adopters, and should be revisited often as cloud adoption is an ongoing journey, not a destination.

- The Plan phase should be focused on aligning technology decisions to business priorities, with clear business outcomes and setting the proper cloud rationalization approach.

- Readying your people, your organization process, and your environment for cloud adoption are critical success factors in your cloud adoption journey.

- Adopting the cloud technologies defined in your plan and for which you have readied your organization, will depend on what you are actually doing: migrating or innovating with a new workload to the cloud.

- Governing and managing your cloud environment is as critical to your successful cloud adoption as any other stage, and as such, should be considered and executed properly.
