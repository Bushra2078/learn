In the last unit, we identified common *motivation triggers* for moving to the cloud. Now, let’s explore how to define your *business strategy* to respond to those triggers. A strong business strategy will help you stay focused on your path toward digital transformation and realize business value more quickly.

When you're defining your cloud business strategy, you should consider things like business impact, turnaround time, global reach, performance, and more. Here are key areas you'll need to focus on:

- **Define business justification** - Identify business value opportunities to then select the right technology.

- **Establish clear business outcomes** - Drive transparency and engagement for your journey across the organization.

## Define business justification

Developing a clear business justification for cloud adoption with tangible, relevant costs and returns can be a complex process. First, review some common business value areas to help justify the cloud adoption journey.

### Cost

Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and then setting up and running onsite datacenters. Azure provides flexible purchase and pricing options for its cloud services.

### Scale

One benefit of cloud computing services is the ability to scale elastically. In cloud-speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, and bandwidth—right when it’s needed and from the right geographic location.

### Productivity

Onsite datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”— including hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, allowing IT teams to spend their time achieving more important business goals.

### Reliability

Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

## Establish clear business outcomes

The most successful cloud adoption journeys start with a business outcome in mind, backed up by financial reasoning and support. A business outcome is a concise, defined, and observable result or change in business performance, captured by a specific measure.

The CFO plays a key role in creating and landing a cloud adoption plan. The CFO can drive the value of migration and innovation and create a financial plan for adoption. The CFO can also work with the Cloud Strategy team to develop cost models that compare IT operations on-premises (in a datacenter) to operations in the cloud. These models should include key measurements to quantify business outcomes.*|

The Cloud Strategy Team consists of business leaders from finance, IT infrastructure, and application groups, and must lead the cloud analysis and planning phase. In this phase, the Cloud Strategy Team is responsible for reviewing business outcomes and for creating the business justification plan for possible use cases for cloud adoption. The team is also responsible for building or facilitating the cloud rationalization process, selecting the first application, and managing subsequent prioritized backlogs. Finally, the Cloud Strategy Team should manage communications with key stakeholders and promote the cloud adoption journey success and learnings.

Here are some tools to support you in your financial planning:

- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator** - Use the Azure TCO calculator to estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your application workloads to Azure.

- **Pricing calculator** - Estimate your expected monthly bill by using our pricing calculator.

- **Azure Cost Management** - Use and manage Azure and other cloud resources through a multiple-cloud cost management solution.

> [!TIP]
> Links to the TCO calculator, pricing calculator, and cost management tools are available in the “Summary and resources” unit at the end of this module.

:::row-end:::

- The key areas to focus on when developing your cloud business strategy are defining your business justification by identifying business value opportunities, selecting the right technology, and establishing clear business outcomes to drive transparency and engagement.

- Some common business justifications for cloud adoption include cost, scale, productivity, and reliability.

- Financial planning for cloud adoption requires organizations to decide whether to expand on-premises capabilities or move certain applications and functions off-premises to cloud-delivered services.

- Microsoft provides several tools to support you in your financial planning: the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator, the Pricing Calculator, and Azure Cost Management.

Now that you have learned about defining your business outcomes and overall strategy for cloud adoption, let’s get started and create a plan for this journey.
