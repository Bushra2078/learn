Azure is being built as the world’s computer, meaning it is the computing fabric that connects applications to the **intelligent edge** of connected systems and devices that gather and analyze data. Azure leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide intelligent computing power to these applications, systems, and devices across the world. This connection between the Azure **intelligent cloud** and the intelligent edge gives organizations the ability to create a new class of connected applications and experiences that drive breakthrough business outcomes.
