Organizations are adopting the cloud as a key enabler to drive business transformation. Examples of those motivations are processes and product improvement, market growth, and increased profitability. Let’s look at the most common motivation triggers for cloud adoption.

## Motivation triggers

Across organization types, sizes,  and industries, the decision to invest in cloud technologies is tightly connected to some critical business events, as the cloud may be the appropriate solution enabler for such events.  Moreover, proper cloud technologies implementation may turn a reactive response into an innovation opportunity to drive growth for the organization.

When addressing these business events, the expected business outcomes will determine the cloud journey for the organization, which essentially can be one of two: migrate or innovate. The **migrate** journey is focused, largely, on completing a migration of existing on-premises applications to the cloud. And the **innovation** journey is frequently linked to migration since it is common for those migrated applications to undergo modernization efforts to drive business and product innovation.
