In this unit, we'll cover a few basics:

* **Define a unit test**: The most basic test.
* **The 3 A's**: Arrange, act, and assert make up the basic structure of tests.
* **Run a test**: Visual Studio provides a few helpful tools to run tests in context.
* **Red, green, refactor**: Every test you write should fail at least once!
* **Different assert statements**: Assert statements make test failures easier to track down.
