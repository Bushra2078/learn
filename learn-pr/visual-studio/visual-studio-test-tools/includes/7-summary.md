Our goal was to help you understand how to write and run tests with Visual Studio test tools.

* **Write a test**: Created a test project, added references, and implemented the three As, arrange, act and assert.
* **View, run, and debug tests**: View and run tests with the various test tools in Visual Studio including the Test Explorer and the editor test tools.
* **Sharpen your test skills**: Expanded test writing skills with fluent assertions, data driven tests and mocking.

Recall the calculator app example from the beginning of this module. As the functionality of the app expanded, more inputs needed to be checked. Manually testing by running the app and trying it out can take a long time. With tests, you can create test methods to put your app through its paces programmatically. You can save all those inputs in your test methods that make sure the behavior of your code stays stable even as you make changes. The Test Explorer enables you to view your tests, run them automatically with one click, and debug specific parts of your code through your tests.
