  questions:
  - content: What do you need to add a reference from your test project to product code?
    choices:
    - content: "Add a reference to the target project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, you need to import both the namespace and add a reference to the project you'd like to test."
    - content: "Both import the namespace and add a project reference"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You need to import both the namespace and add a reference to the project you'd like to test."
    - content: "Import the namespace, add a project reference, and add @test decorator on the test method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, the @test decorator is a java idiom. .NET uses [TestMethod], but this decorator is normally already included as part of the template."
  - content: Which of the following cause a test to fail?
    choices:
    - content: "A failing assert statement is the only reason a test would fail."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, tests can fail even if all the assert statements are passing."
    - content: "A test fails when **most** asserts in the test are failing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tests will fail if there is at least one failing assert."
    - content: "Tests can fail for various reasons including at least one failing assert, an uncaught exception, or if the test times out."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! There are several reasons a test may fail. Always check the test output to determine the cause of a failure."
