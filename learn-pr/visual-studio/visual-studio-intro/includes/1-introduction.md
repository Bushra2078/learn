This introduction covers the most frequently used tools inside of the Visual Studio IDE (integrated development environment). This powerful IDE brings intuitive and cutting-edge programming tools to your finger tips. This tutorial is for Visual Studio and not Visual Studio Code, but it will cover the differences and advantages of each as well as the many ways IDEs empower your developer flow beyond writing code with quality analysis, extensions, and built-in publishing tools.

## Example scenario

Suppose you are just starting to learn programming or are new to Visual Studio developer tools in general. You know a good way to start is by building your first website. It can be a place you can post blogs, keep your resume, and generally be a space that friends, recruiters, or co-workers can find to get to know you. You may have watched some videos online or maybe even coded some of your first python, javascript, or csharp code. There are a ton of great learning tools for coding these languages that execute entirely in the browser, but you are ready to get these running on your computer locally. You've learned you'll need a code editor or IDE (integrated development environment) to code and compile on your own computer and you are ready to dig in! The first step is understanding what tools you'd like to use for programming and how they can help you code a great app.

## What will we be doing?

Visual Studio brings the best of development environments to your programming flow. This quick introduction will familiarize you with the tools included in this advanced coding editor including:

* What is Visual Studio? (and how is it different from Visual Studio Code?)
* What is in Visual Studio?
  * Editor
  * Debugger
  * Customization
  * Extensions
  * Live Share
  * Publishing tools
  * and more!
* When should I use Visual Studio?

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be more familiar with Visual Studio as an integrated development environment and know when to use the powerful tool to help you code, debug, and publish your apps.
