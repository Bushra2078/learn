## Visual Studio or VSCode?

To address the most popular question these days: what is the difference between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code? Visual Studio Code is a wildly popular light-weight source code editor that was first released in 2015. It's a part of our Visual Studio editor family. Visual Studio is the fully integrated development environment with world class editor and debugger. VSCode is open source and free to use. Visual Studio is not open source, but the Community edition is free for students, open-source contributors, and individuals! VSCode allows amazing rapid open source development of its extensions. In VSCode, you manage most of the extensions that provide build tools and language support to your editor. In Visual Studio, much more is built in for a more focused and curated experience.
