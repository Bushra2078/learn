There are many of options for IDEs out there. Choose what works best for you! Plenty of developers have both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code installed and use each for different tasks. The important thing is making sure you have the tools that make you the most productive.

I strongly recommend using Visual Studio if you're a beginning C# or C++ developer. The tooling for these languages is first-class and lots of hints are built in just to keep new users on track. It helps you find the right templates with good descriptions when you're creating a different app type (mobile, gaming, and IOT apps for example). It provides versioning help and UI for managing your project properties. You can easily create and navigate git repos. These are all small helpful things Visual Studio can do for you.

That's all to say, use Visual Studio if you want a fully integrated development experience on your local machine. The Community edition is free for students, open-source contributors, and individuals! There's a Professional license for developers working in teams and an Enterprise license that has even more features packed into the IDE.
