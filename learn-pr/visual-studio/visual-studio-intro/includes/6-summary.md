You've now had a basic introduction to Visual Studio. As mentioned in the beginning, this IDE is over 20 years old so don't be surprised if you find yourself learning something new regularly!

* You've learned what an IDE is and the difference is between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
* We've covered the fundamental features that make up a world-class IDE such as:
  * Editor features like intellisense, navigation, and code fixes.
  * Debugger features that help you inspect code as it runs.
  * Customizing your IDE by changing the themes and windows to suit your needs.
  * Popular extensions created by the ecosystem of developers that use Visual Studio.
  * Collaborative coprogramming with Live Share.
  * Publishing tools that help deploy your app to the cloud.
* You now know when Visual Studio might help you with your different developer tasks.

Recall the example at the beginning of this module of learning to program your first website. Visual Studio can help you select website templates to help you get started. It offers hints and warnings as you type in the Editor. And you can inspect your webapp as it runs locally with debugger tools. Hopefully this module gave you a good understanding of why so many developers find IDEs make them more productive. Happy coding!
