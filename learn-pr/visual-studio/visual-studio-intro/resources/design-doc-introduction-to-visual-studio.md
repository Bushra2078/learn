# Module Design

## Title

Introduction to Visual Studio

## Role(s)

- Developer

## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Visual Studio

## Prerequisites

- Some experience with beginner computer skills like installing an app from the internet
- Beginner familiarity with programming concepts like editors and debuggers

## Summary

This introduction covers the most frequently used tools inside of the Visual Studio IDE (integrated development environment). This powerful IDE brings intuitive and cutting-edge programming tools to your finger tips. This tutorial is for Visual Studio and not Visual Studio Code, but it will cover the differences and advantages of each as well as the many ways IDEs empower your developer flow beyond writing code with quality analysis, extensions, and built-in publishing tools.

## Learning objectives

1. Learn what Visual Studio is and how it differs from Visual Studio Code.
1. Familiarize yourself with the main features of Visual Studio that millions of developers use everyday in their full-time jobs such as the editor and the debugger.
1. Make the IDE your own with customization and extensions.
1. Learn how you can connect the IDE to collaboratively code and publish your code to the cloud.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Introduction to Visual Studio*

| Subtask             | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy?              | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--|

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice:

    - *Suppose you are just starting to learn programming or are new to Visual Studio developer tools in general. You know a good way to start is by building your first website. It can be a place you can post blogs, keep your resume, and generally be a space that friends, recruiters, or co-workers can find to get to know you. You may have watched some videos online or maybe even coded some of your first python, javascript, or csharp code. There are a ton of great learning tools for coding these languages that execute entirely in the browser, but you are ready to get these running on your computer locally. You've learned you'll need a code editor or IDE (integrated development environment) to code and compile on your own computer and you are ready to dig in! The first step is understanding what tools you'd like to use for programming and how they can help you code a great app.*

1. **What is Visual Studio?**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *understand what Visual Studio is and how it differs from Visual Studio Code.*:

- Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that’s very popular for .NET and C++ workloads and it does support many languages and frameworks and has a massive ecosystem of extensions because Visual Studio has been around for over 20 years!
- To address the most popular question these days: what is the difference between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code? Visual Studio Code is a wildly popular light-weight source code editor. It only came out a few years ago. It is a part of our Visual Studio editor family, but Visual Studio is the fully integrated development environment with world class editing and debugging experiences.
- Millions of developers all over the world have logged a significant number of hours in Visual Studio. So, over the years, a lot has gone in to making it nice. Imagine working in the same office for years for 40 hours a week! You end up sprucing up the place little by little to make you the most productive. All the features may be a little overwhelming to new users, but hopefully after this learning path you’ll feel a little more at home.
- So with that, Visual Studio is one of the most popular editing environments and that’s not just me saying it, stackoverflow’s annual developer surveys reported us at #2 on most popular and Visual Studio Code is #1!

1. **How Visual Studio works**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *familiarize themselves with the main features of Visual Studio that millions of developers use everyday in their full-time jobs such as the editor and the debugger.*:

    - Editor
        - It also has excellent code completion, syntax highlighting, quick info hints, errors and warnings that come with codefix suggestions. That help you understand more about the code you are writing.
        - IntelliCode
        - Built-in codefixes and code style  
        - Navigation
        - snippets
    - Debugger
        - F5 debugging
        - Set a break point
        - Step through code
        - Inspect variables
        - Inspect an exception
    - Customization (Check what top changes are in telemetry)
        - Change themes
        - Tools Options - more colors, fonts
        - Window layouts
        - Toolbar
    - Extensions
        - Popular extensions in marketplace (Editor guidelines, boost.test, xunit)
        - Constantly expanding and evolving ecosystem (people have entire businesses of extending Visual Studio!)
    - Live Share
        - Benefits of pair programming and simplicity of tool
        - Specifically good for students and teachers, but also used everyday by professional developers
    - Publishing to the Cloud
        - Publish to Azure so your website is live
        - Connecting Azure account
        - Other Git and pipeline tools

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *Introduction to Visual Studio*?

    - Select the differences between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
    - What is one tool that enables me to pair program in Visual Studio?
    - What ways can Visual Studio help me publish my apps?

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

    - Explained what Visual Studio is and how it is different from VSCode
    - Learned how the editor and debugger can help you code and improve code quality
    - Customized and extended the IDE to make it a great personalized experience
    - Connected the IDE to our friends and co-workers for collaborative coding with live share and published to the cloud
