## Chunk your content into subtasks

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Validating code changes and quality | Why we test | Knowledge Check | 1 | No, combine with why we test |
| Industry examples | Why we test | Knowledge Check | 1 | No, combine with why we test |
| Testing effects on architecture | Why we test | Knowledge Check | 1 | No, combine with why we test |
| Code coverage and code health | Why we test | Knowledge Check | 1 | No, combine with why we test |
| Types of testing and the testing pyramid | Types of testing and the testing pyramid | Knowledge Check | 2 | Yes |
| TDD, DRY, Red/Green/Refactor | Schools of thought | Knowledge Check | 3 | No, combine with Schools of thought |
| Choose what works for you | Schools of thought | Knowledge Check | 3 | No, combine with Schools of thought |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    There are many reasons you may be interested in starting testing.Perhaps your manager/mentor/professor just asked you to add tests to your code. Maybe your company is interested in improving code quality and catching bugs faster. Maybe another developer asked what your code coverage is like in a discussion on code quality. Maybe the behavior of your app is growing quickly and you need a formal way to capture and check all functionality as your project continues to scale. This learning module will cover why we test and a brief introduction to testing software best practices. We'll go over different types of testing starting at the most fundamental level, unit tests. We'll also touch on various schools of thought around testing. There are limitless testing technologies out there, but no matter your language or software stack, this guidance should help you to get a grasp of the basic concepts and help you avoid common pitfalls.
