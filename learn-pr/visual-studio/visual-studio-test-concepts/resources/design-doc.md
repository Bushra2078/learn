## Role(s)

- developer
- student

## Level

- beginner

## Product(s)

- dotnet
- dotnet-core
- visual-studio

## Prerequisites

- Ability to write C# at the beginner level with C# concepts including writing methods and creating projects.
- Basic familiarity with debugging an app.
- Visual Studio should be installed.

## Summary

Learn the common best practices, theory, and anti-patterns to avoid when writing tests.

## Learning objectives

1. Why we test
1. Types of testing and the testing pyramid
1. Schools of thought when it comes to testing

## Chunk your content into subtasks

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Validating code changes and quality | Why we test | Knowledge Check | 1 | No, combine with why we test |
| Industry examples | Why we test | Knowledge Check | 1 | No, combine with why we test |
| Testing effects on architecture | Why we test | Knowledge Check | 1 | No, combine with why we test |
| Code coverage and code health | Why we test | Knowledge Check | 1 | No, combine with why we test |
| Types of testing and the testing pyramid | Types of testing and the testing pyramid | Knowledge Check | 2 | Yes |
| TDD, DRY, Red/Green/Refactor | Schools of thought | Knowledge Check | 3 | No, combine with Schools of thought |
| Choose what works for you | Schools of thought | Knowledge Check | 3 | No, combine with Schools of thought |
