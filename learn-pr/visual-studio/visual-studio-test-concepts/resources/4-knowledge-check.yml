### General guidance (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)
###  - Questions are complete sentences ending with a question mark
###  - No true/false questions
###  - 3 answers per question
###  - All answers about the same length
###  - Numeric answers listed in sorted order
###  - No "All of the above" and/or "None of the above" as answer choices
###  - No "Not" or "Except" in questions
###  - No second person ("you") in the questions or answers
###  - Provide a meaningful explanation for both correct and incorrect answers
###
### Question content requirements:
###  - Write 5 questions
###  - Questions 1,2 must test this Learning Objective: "Describe how (attributes) of (product) work to (solve problem)"
###      Guidance: These two questions can be short, no need for a long scenario to analyze. Test if they understand how the product works.
###      Example: "What differentiates an action from a control action in an Azure Logic App?"
###  - Questions 3,4,5 must test this Learning Objective: "Evaluate whether (product) is appropriate to (general product use case)"
###      Guidance: Use scenario questions that ask the learner to analyze a situation with the "when to use" criteria presented in the module.
###      Example: "Suppose you work for a financial company. You're building a system to let your brokers trade financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you'll have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?"

quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which of these is **not** a benefit of testing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tests encourage a more modular architecture."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tests do encourage a more modular architecture by using unit tests to encourage separating methods by functionality that can be called independently."
    - content: "The code coverage tests provide is the ultimate indication of repo health."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Code coverage is not the ultimate indicator of repo health, there could be many other factors involved such as number of contributors over time or number of open bugs or issues."
    - content: "Tests help keep track of the different capabilities of a program."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tests can help keep track of different capabilities by checking all functionality regularly even as new code is added."
    - content: "Tests help large repositories built by a community avoid bugs by providing checks for both old and new behavior."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tests do help maintain large repositories by providing a way to check functionality that does not depend on a single person understanding the full system, but rather by checking behaviors programmatically."
  - content: "The correct code coverage goal in a repo is"
    choices:
    - content: "100%"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "100% code coverage can often be a unrealistic and unhelpful goal for modern code bases. Not *all* code needs to be tested and you don't want to require a team to do any busy work just to reach a complete percentage that doesn't actually improve code quality. Over investing in tests can also be harmful if it comes at the cost of expanding the functionality of your app and business."
    - content: "70%"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is some advice that indicates 70% code coverage could be a happy medium of code coverage, but there isn't much empirical evidence supporting this specific number today. Most commonly, developers observe some kind of drop in efficacy code coverage as it increases between 70% and 100%. Any new bugs that tests may possibly find diminish and it gets more time consuming to write tests only to achieve coverage rather than wholistically thinking about testing different behaviors of your code."
    - content: "50%"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "In most cases, this may be considered too low to be an effective or motivating goal."
    - content: "There is no one true answer. Your code coverage goal depends on the repository."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "There is no one true answer that can be applied to all code bases equally. It is best to agree as a team on a metric and pay more attention to new code causing code coverage to decrease to indicate it's time to test the newly added functionality."
