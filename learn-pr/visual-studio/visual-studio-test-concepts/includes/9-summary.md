Our goal was to help you understand the purpose, concepts, and schools of thought behind testing and how they can help you improve your code quality.

* **Explored concepts**: We explored the concept of testing is and how it can help catch bugs before release.
* **Explained benefits of testing**. Testing helps validate code changes, improve architecture, and improve code health.
* **Learned about different types of testing**.  Different types of testing can address different needs in a code base.
* **Discovered different schools of thought**. We explained the testing schools of thought that help guide good practices across teams.

You saw how testing can both document and verify behavior in the phone number example. Tests enable you to automatically check functionality with out needing to consciously walk through every supported scenario. Any app that is constantly growing can make use of tests to verify that new functionality doesn't break old behavior.

Learning about the different types of tests can open up new ways of verifying your code. Maybe the validity of some changes are confirmed by your unit tests, but a performance test catches that a function is now taking twice as long to execute. Maybe the unit tests and performance tests pass, but your UI tests catch strange behavior when it actually comes to rendering your UI. Testing from multiple different perspectives improves the quality of your app before it reaches customers.
The testing schools of thought recommend different styles of testing that can drive teams towards better architecture and higher code coverage. While you don't have to follow them to-the-letter, it's good to know there is plenty of guidance out there for people wanting to evolve their testing practices.
