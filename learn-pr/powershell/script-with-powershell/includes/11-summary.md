In this module, you learned about PowerShell and how you can use it to automate tasks by authoring and running scripts.

You then went on to improve your scripts by using variables and parameters, thereby making the scripts more flexible.

Then you were introduced to flow control and how that can be used to control how the script is run. You specifically implemented some checks to _sanitize_ input, to ensure the script would exit early if not certain conditions were met. Additionally you also added checks to ensure it only carried out its task (backing up files) if there was not pre-existing backup file.

Finally you were introduced to error handling. In PowerShell, there's the notion of non terminating and terminating errors. You learned to differentiate between these two types of errors and also manage them differently.

You should now have a good understanding of how to author and run scripts. Additionally you should be able to use various constructs of the PowerShell language to improve a script's flexibility and robustness.
