  questions:
    - content: What command offers the best experience for finding out more about a command?
      choices:
        - content: "`{your command} --help`"
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`Get-Help {your command}`"
          explanation: The command `Get-Help` is what you use to find out more about a command. However, the command `help` offers a better experience as it paginates the response and lets you traverse it row by row.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`help {your command}`"
          explanation: Correct. By using `help`, you pipe `Get-Help` into a function so that you can see the help page. You can see it row by row and line by line if you want.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: "`man {your command}`"
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: Which statement is the best choice to _filter left_?
      choices:
        - content: "`Get-Process | Select-Object Name | Where-Object Name -eq name-of-process`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: In this statement, the filtering happens last (that is, on the _right_ side of the statement). Filtering last is inefficient and slow, especially if the command is sent over the network and the data store is large.
        - content: "`Get-Process | Where-Object Name -eq name-of-process | Select-Object name-of-process`"
          explanation: Almost. In this statement, filtering happens early (that is, on the right side of the statement). But the statement would be faster if it used the built-in filter.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`Get-Process -Name name-of-process | Select-Object Name`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This solution is the best choice. The statement filters early and uses a built-in filter.
    - content: Which statement will most efficiently find the returned type from a command?
      choices:
        - content: "`{command} --type`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: "`{command} | Get-Member`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The cmdlet `Get-Member` lists the returned type at the top of the response. 
        - content: "`{command} | Get-Type`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: "`{command} Get-Member`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The command needs to be piped with `Get-Member`.
