In this module, you started by learning what PowerShell is and what you can use it for. You explored its primary features, and how it differs from traditional shells like Git Bash. You also looked at how to install PowerShell, and briefly explored authoring it by using Visual Studio Code and an extension.

You then learned about compiled commands called cmdlets. You looked specifically at a command called`Get-Command` that helps you locate the command you need.

You should now have a good understanding of PowerShell, what it's used for, and how to use its commands efficiently.
