In this module, you started by learning what PowerShell is and what you can use it for. You explored its primary features and how it differs from traditional shells like Git Bash. You also looked at how to install PowerShell and briefly explored authoring it by using Visual Studio Code and an extension.

You then learned about compiled commands called cmdlets. You focused on three specific cmdlets, known as _core cmdlets_. Core cmdlets help you list available commands. You learned how to use them to take advantage of the built-in help system and inspect the results from any cmdlet. These commands help you efficiently build your knowledge about PowerShell.

Later you learned about how to connect cmdlets together to form powerful expressions called pipelines. In a pipeline, one cmdlet's output serves as the input for the next connected cmdlet.

Finally, you learned about important principles like _filter left_ and _format right_. By using these principles, you can write expressions efficiently.

You should now have a good understanding of PowerShell, what it's used for, and how to use its commands efficiently.
