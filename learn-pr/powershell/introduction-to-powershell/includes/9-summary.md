In this module, you started by learning what PowerShell is and what you can use it for. You explored its primary features and how it differs from tradition shells like Bash. You also looked at how to install PowerShell and briefly looked at authoring it with Visual Studio code and an extension.

You were then introduced to compiled commands called cmdlets. Using three specific cmdlets, known as _core cmdlets_, they help with listing available commands, leveraging the built-in help system and helps inspect the results on any cmdlet. All put together, these commands helps you build out your knowledge on PowerShell in an efficient way.

Thereafter you focused more on understanding how to connect different cmdlets together to form powerful expressions called pipelines. The idea is that one cmdlet's output serves as the input for the upcoming connected cmdlet.

Finally you learned about important principles like _filter left_ and _format right_ to ensure the expressions you write are constructed in the most efficient way possible.

You should now have a good understanding of what PowerShell, what it's used for and how you use it and its commands efficiently.
