PowerShell comes preinstalled with numerous commands. To use those commands efficiently you need to understand how they work. You need to know what parameters they take, that there might be more than one way to call a command and so on. On top of that there's great value in knowing what a command returns, what type and thereby what properties. By knowing these things, youu can configure what gets displayed but it also gives you a hint on how a particular command fits with another command, should you choose to combine them.

## Learning objectives

- Use the help system efficiently.
- Understand how you can inspect a command's response and what you can use that knowledge for.
