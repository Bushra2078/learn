PowerShell comes preinstalled with numerous commands. To use those commands efficiently, you need to understand how they work. You need to know what parameters the commands take, that there might be more than one way to call a command, and so on. On top of that, there's great value in knowing what a command returns, what type it returns, and what properties. By knowing these things, you can configure what is displayed, but you also get a hint of how a specific command fits with another command if you choose to combine them.

## Learning objectives

- Use the help system efficiently.
