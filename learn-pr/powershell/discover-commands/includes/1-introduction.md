PowerShell comes preinstalled with numerous commands. To use PowerShell commands efficiently, you need to understand how they work. For example, you need to know what parameters the commands take and that there might be more than one way to call a command. 

It's also helpful to know what a command returns, what type it returns, and the command's properties. By knowing these things, you can configure how help is shown. You also get a hint of how a specific command fits with another command if you combine them.
