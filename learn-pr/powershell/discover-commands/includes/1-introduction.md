PowerShell comes preinstalled with many commands. To use those commands efficiently, you need to understand how they work. You need to know what parameters the commands take, that there might be more than one way to call a command, and so on. 

There's also value in knowing what a command returns, what type it returns, and the command's properties. By knowing these things, you can configure the help that is shown, and you get a hint of how a specific command fits with another command if you combine them.

## Learning objectives

When you finish this module, you'll be able to:

- Inspect commands to understand how to call them.
- Understand what a command returns and customize what it returns.
