In this module, you learned how to inspect a command that you intend to use. Looking at a command before you use it helps you call the command correctly and learn the different ways you can call the command. 

You also looked at inspecting what a command returns. PowerShell commands return objects. By calling `Get-Member`, you learn what type of object will be returned and its properties. With that information, you can for related commands that operate on same object type.

You'll learn how to leverage this object type information in other modules when we look at pipelines and combining many commands in one.
