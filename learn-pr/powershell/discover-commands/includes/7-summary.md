In this module, you looked at inspecting a command you mean to use. The reason for doing so is to call the command corectly but also realize that there might be more than one way to call a command. 

Additionally you looked at inspecting what a command returned. PowerShell commands return objects. By calling `Get-Member` you learn what type of object that is and what properties it has. Knowing that information you can then search for other commands to learn what commands are related, that is that operates on that same object type.

You will learn how to leverage this object type information in other modules as we will be looking at pipelines, combining many commands in one.
