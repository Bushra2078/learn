In PowerShell, you run compiled commands, or cmdlets. By connecting these cmdlets, you can create powerful statements, or pipelines. You'll find such _combined_ statements useful as you're looking to automate your workflows.

As part of creating these _pipelines_, it's beneficial to understand how to format the responses to your liking. For example, a carefully selected format might make it easier for you to quickly get an overview of a situation or fit it into a report.

When you learn to combine cmdlets, you unlock much of the power that's built into PowerShell.

## Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:
  - Explore cmdlets further and construct a sequence of them in a pipeline.
  - Apply sound principles to your commands by using _filtering_ and _formatting_.
