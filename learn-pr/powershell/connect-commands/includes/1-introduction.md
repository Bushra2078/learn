PowerShell has compiled commands, so called cmdlets. By connecting these cmdlets you can create powerful statements, so called pipelines. Such _combined_ statements can be useful as you're looking to automate your workflows.

As part of creating these _pipelines_ it's beneficial to understand how you can format the response to your liking. A carefully selected formatting might make it easier to quickly get an overview of a situation or fit it into a report for example.

When you learn to combine cmdlets, you unlock much of the power that PowerShell gives you.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explore cmdlets further and construct a sequence of them in a pipeline.
