Running a command can be powerful, you get data from either your local machine or across the network. To be even more effective, you need to learn how to get the data that you want. Most commands operate on objects, as input or as output, or both. Objects have properties and you likely want a subset of those properties and present them in reports for example. You might also want to sort the data based on one or more columns. But how do you get there?

## Use Get-Member to inspect output

When you pass the results of a command to `Get-Member`, `Get-Member` returns information about the object, information like:

- The type of object being passed to Get-Member.
- The Properties of the object that may be evaluated.
- The Methods of the object that may be executed.

Let's demonstrate this fact by running `Get-Member` on the command `Get-Process`.

```powershell
Get-Process zsh | Get-Member
```

Note how you are using the pipe `|` and that by calling `Get-Member`, you are in fact creating a pipeline already. The outcome of the statement above looks like so (at least the first few lines):

```output
TypeName: System.Diagnostics.Process

Name                       MemberType     Definition
----                       ----------     ----------
Handles                    AliasProperty  Handles = Handlecount
Name                       AliasProperty  Name = ProcessName
NPM                        AliasProperty  NPM = NonpagedSystemMemorySize64
PM                         AliasProperty  PM = PagedMemorySize64
SI                         AliasProperty  SI = SessionId
VM                         AliasProperty  VM = VirtualMemorySize64
WS                         AliasProperty  WS = WorkingSet64
...
```

Above you are shown both the type of object the `Get-Process` returns, i.e `System.Diagnostics.Process` and also properties. The rest of the response shows all the properties this object consist of. If you wanted to fit `Get-Process` with another command in a pipeline, running `Get-Member` would be the first steps in finding this out.

## Select-Object

By default, when you run a command that is going to output to the screen, Powershell automatically adds the command `Out-Default`. If this is not just a collection of strings, but objects - PowerShell looks at the object type to determine if there is a registered view for that object type, if so, it uses that view.

The view generally doesn't contain all the properties of an object because it wouldn't display properly on screen, so only some of the most common properties are selected in the view.

You can override the default view by using `Select-Object` and choosing your own list of properties. you can then send those properties to `Format-Table` or `Format-List`, to display the table however you like...

Consider the result of running `Get-Process` on the process `zsh`:

```output
 NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
 ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
      0     0.00       0.01       0.38     644 620 zsh
      0     0.00       0.01       0.38     727 727 zsh
      0     0.00       0.01       0.38     731 731 zsh
      0     0.00       0.01       0.38     743 743 zsh
      0     0.00       0.01       0.38     750 750 zsh
      0     0.00       0.88       0.91   15747 …47 zsh
      0     0.00       0.01       0.29   41983 …83 zsh
      0     0.00       1.16       0.31   68298 …98 zsh
```

What you are seeing is a view that represents what you most likely want to see from this command, that does not mean that's all the information there is. The way to show something different than the above response is by explicitly specifying what properties you want to see.

### Getting the full response

What you've seen so far is a limited response. To present the full response, you use a wildcard `*`, like so:

```powershell
Get-Process zsh | Format-List -Property *
```

This character `*`, shows you every single attribute and their value and you can start investigating what values you are interested in. You likely don't want this massive response but you may not be content with the default response either.

However, the response you get is using presentation names for properties, not the actual property names and is something that looks good in a report.

### Selecting specific columns

To limit the response and find a middle ground between the default response and the full response, you want to select some properties you are interested in and have that as parameter input to `Select-Object`. But, and here's a problem, you need to use the real names for the columns. How do you find out the real names? Use `Get-Member`. A call to `Get-Member` gives you all the properties and their actual names.

### Finding the real property name

Let's quickly recap on the default response, with this subset:

```output
 NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
 ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
      0     0.00       0.01       0.38     644 620 zsh
```

From the default response, the properties `Id` and `ProcessName` are most likely called the same, but CPU(s) is a presentation name, real property names tend to consist of only text characters and no spaces. To find out the real name for said property, you can use `Get-Member` to find out:

```powershell
Get-Process zsh | Get-Member -Name C*
```

You now get a list of all members that starts with a `C` and among them is `CPU`, which is likely what you want:

```output
TypeName: System.Diagnostics.Process

Name             MemberType     Definition
----             ----------     ----------
CancelErrorRead  Method         void CancelErrorRead()
CancelOutputRead Method         void CancelOutputRead()
Close            Method         void Close()
CloseMainWindow  Method         bool CloseMainWindow()
Container        Property       System.ComponentModel.IContainer Container {get;}
CommandLine      ScriptProperty System.Object CommandLine {get=…
Company          ScriptProperty System.Object Company {get=$this.Mainmodule.FileVersionInfo.CompanyName;}
CPU              ScriptProperty System.Object CPU {get=$this.TotalProcessorTime.TotalSeconds;}
```

With all these learnings, you can now use `Select-Object` and ask exactly for what you need and with correct property names like so:

```powershell
Get-Process zsh | Select-Object -Property Id, Name, CPU
```

and here it is:

```output
Id Name       CPU
-- ----       ---
644 zsh  0.3812141
727 zsh  0.3826498
731 zsh  0.3784953
743 zsh  0.3776352
750 zsh  0.3824036
15747 zsh  0.9097993
41983 zsh  0.2934763
68298 zsh  0.3121695
```

an output that differs from the default output but contains properties that you care about.

## Sorting

Using `Sort-Object` in pipeline, PowerShell attempts to sort the output data. It does so by relying by first looking at the default properties and sort by those properties. If no such properties exist, it tries to compare the objects themselves. The sorting is either by ascending or descending order.

By providing properties, you can choose to sort by specific columns, like so:

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Descending -Property Name
```

Above we are sorting by both the column `Name` and in descending order. To sort by more than one column, you can add a secondary column to sort by, by separating column names via a comma, like so:

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Descending -Property Name, CPU
```

Additionally to sorting by column name, you can also provide your own custom expression, like in this example:

```powershell
Get-Process 'some process' | Sort-Object -Property @{Expression = "Name"; Descending = $True}, @{Expression = "CPU"; Descending = $False}
```

In the above example, you sort by columns `Name` and `CPU` and you're able to control sort order for each column. This topic is a bit advanced and out of scope for this module, but will be revisited in more advanced modules. It's good to see though that `Sort-Object` is powerful and flexible.
