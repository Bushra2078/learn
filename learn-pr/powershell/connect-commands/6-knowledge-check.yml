quiz:
  questions:
    - content: Which statement is the best choice for _filtering left_?
      choices:
        - content: "`Get-Process | Select-Object Name | Where-Object Name -eq
            name-of-process`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: In this statement, the filtering happens late (that is, at the _right side_ of the statement). Filtering late is inefficient and slow, especially if the command is sent over the network and the data store is large.
        - content: "`Get-Process | Where-Object Name -eq name-of-process | Select-Object name-of-process`"
          explanation: Almost. In this statement, filtering happens early (that is, toward the _left side_ of the statement). But the statement would be faster if it uses the built-in filter.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`Get-Process -Name name-of-process | Select-Object Name`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This solution is the best choice. The statement filters early and uses a built-in filter.
    - content: How do you know whether a command accepts pipeline input?
      choices:
        - content: If a parameter accepts an array, with a type, it accepts pipeline input.
          explanation: Incorrect. It also needs to set the `Accept pipeline input?` to _True_, with a description that is either `(ByValue)` or `(ByPropertyName)`.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: It has the property `Accept pipeline input?` set to _True_, with a description that is either `(ByValue)` or `(ByPropertyName)`.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: The parameter has the property `Pipeline` set to _True_.
          explanation: Incorrect. It needs to have the property `Accept pipeline input?` set to _True_.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: What does it mean when a parameter `-Id` of type `<System.Int32[]>` has the description `Accept pipeline input?  True  (ByPropertyName)`?
      choices:
        - content: It means that the parameter accepts an array of objects as pipeline input, where each object has a property with the name `Id`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The `(ByPropertyName)` description allows an object to have to match _only_ a singular property. To make an object match a pipeline input, you might need to rename a specific property. You do this rather than cast the entire object to a new type, which would be required with `(ByValue)`.
        - content: The parameter `Id` accepts pipeline input in the form of an array of `Int32`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. `Id` accepts a pipeline input of an array of objects, where each object needs to have a property called `Id` of type `Int32`.
        - content: The parameter `Id` accepts an `Int32` as input.
          explanation: Incorrect. `Id` accepts a pipeline input of an array of objects, where each object needs to have a property called `Id` of type `Int32`.
          isCorrect: false
