  questions:
    - content: Which statement is the best choice to _filter left_?
      choices:
        - content: "`Get-Process | Select-Object Name | Where-Object Name -eq
            name-of-process`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: In this statement, the filtering happens last (that is, on the
            _right_ side of the statement). Filtering last is inefficient and
            slow, especially if the command is sent over the network and the
            data store is large.
        - content: "`Get-Process | Where-Object Name -eq name-of-process | Select-Object
            name-of-process`"
          explanation: Almost. In this statement, filtering happens early (that is, on the
            right side of the statement). But the statement would be faster if
            it used the built-in filter.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`Get-Process -Name name-of-process | Select-Object Name`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This solution is the best choice. The statement filters
            early and uses a built-in filter.
    - content: How do you know if a command accepts pipeline input?
      choices:
        - content: If a parameter accepts an array, with a type, then it accepts pipeline
            input.
          explanation: Incorrect. It needs to set the `Accept pipeline input?` to True as
            well with description being either `(ByValue)` or
            `(ByPropertyName)`.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: It has the property `Accept pipeline input?` set to True, with
            description being either `(ByValue)` or `(ByPropertyName)`.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: The parameter has the property `Pipeline` set to True.
          explanation: Incorrect. It needs to have the property `Accept pipeline input?`
            set to True.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: What does it mean when a parameter `-Id` of type `<System.Int32[]>` has
        the following description `Accept pipeline input?       True
        (ByPropertyName)`?
      choices:
        - content: It means it accepts an array of objects, as pipeline input, where each
            object has a property with the name `Id`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The `(ByPropertyName)` description, allows an object to
            _only_ needing to match on a singular property. To make an object
            match a pipeline input, you might need to rename a specific
            property, rather than cast the entire object to a new type, that
            would be required with `(ByValue)`.
        - content: The parameter `Id`, accepts pipeline input in the form of an array of
            `Int32`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. It accepts a pipeline input, an array of objects, where
            each object needs to have a property called `Id` of type `Int32`.
        - content: The parameter `Id` accepts an `Int32` as input.
          explanation: Incorrect. It accepts a pipeline input, an array of objects, where
            each object needs to have a property called `Id` of type `Int32`.
          isCorrect: false
