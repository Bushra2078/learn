Software as a Service (SaaS) is cloud-based software that’s centrally hosted and managed by software vendors for their users. SaaS has become a popular software licensing and delivery method because of its ease of use and the efficiencies it unlocks for software providers and their customers. Users access SaaS applications over a network connection and, in most cases, pay to use the software on a subscription basis. Software providers develop, host, manage, and support the applications on their cloud infrastructure. Examples of SaaS range from web-based email services such as Outlook to sophisticated business applications like Microsoft 365 apps.

### SaaS benefits for customers

With SaaS, customers don’t need to worry about managing technical infrastructure, app software, or data management responsibilities. Instead, customers simply pay to use the software, allowing them to focus on the value they get from using the application.

Users connect to SaaS apps on the web, which means that they can access the applications from any internet-connected computer or mobile device. This makes it easier for customers to mobilize their workforces since their employees can use these applications to work from anywhere. Customers don’t need to invest in making applications run on different types of devices or managing security because the software provider is responsible for that.

### SaaS benefits for software providers

SaaS lets software providers innovate at a faster pace by increasing the speed and frequency of product updates. Because SaaS is centrally hosted and managed in the cloud, software providers can push updates to their application almost instantly. Centralization also means they can implement any app updates for all their users at the same time, eliminating the need to coordinate complicated changes with individual customers. This translates to cost savings through economies of scale.

### Choosing SaaS for the commercial marketplace

If you’re wondering if SaaS is the right licensing and delivery method for your application, think about your customers and the service you’re providing. If your customers are the kind of users that want to subscribe to your service without taking responsibility for application deployment and configuration details, SaaS could be a good fit. To help you make a decision, we’ll spend the rest of this module explaining how SaaS applications are listed and sold in the commercial marketplace.
