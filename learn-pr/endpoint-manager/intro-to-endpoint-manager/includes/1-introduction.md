Technology is evolving in the modern workplace.

![Diagram of modern workplace technology trends.](../media/intro-to-endpoint-manager-00.png)

According to the preceding diagram:
- Most companies use cloud services.
- Software updates are continuous and frequent.
- Most companies allow use of personal mobile devices in the workplace.
- Most employees use mobile apps for work-related activities.
- Cybersecurity is a growing concern, and data breaches are increasingly expensive.

This evolution leads to the following changes in information technology (IT) practices:

- Knowledge workers that used single devices now use multiple devices.
- Shared devices such as retail point of sale devices and ruggedized devices are more common.
- Specialized devices such as digital interactive whiteboards, conference room devices, and holographic wearable computers are more common.
- Devices that were corporate owned can now be owned by users or the corporation.
- Legacy apps on the corporate network are now joined by cloud-managed and software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps.
- IT admins are moving from manual, reactive processes toward automated processes.
- Instead of providing high-touch support environments, organizations now provide self-service solutions.

## Access data

Users within your organization:

- Can be employees, coworkers, and students.
- Might open and share personal files, visit unsecured websites, and install potentially unsafe apps.
- Want to use their devices to access all of their information and resources, whether at work, school, or home.
- Need to share information with trusted and verified coworkers.

These users must be able to access organizational resources seamlessly and securely to do their work:

- On iOS/iPadOS, Android, Windows, or macOS devices.
- On company devices or their own devices.
- On multiple types of devices.
- In a variety of formats, such as from an app or displayed in a web browser.

As an IT admin or business decision maker, you must find modern methods and technologies to successfully protect your organization against digital threats while maintaining productivity. You can start by implementing services and tools to protect the digital devices, apps, and data that the members of your organization need to be productive.

## Protect resources

You can help protect resources and devices by using mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) services and tools.

MDM enables organizations to protect and secure their resources and data based on enrolled devices. Organizations can make sure that only authorized people and devices get access to proprietary information. Device users can feel at ease accessing work data from their device, such as a phone, because they know their device meets their organization's security requirements. MAM enables organizations to manage and protect their data within an application.

An MDM or MAM solution must accomplish the following tasks:

- Support a diverse mobile environment to securely manage iOS/iPadOS, Android, Windows, and macOS devices.
- Make sure devices and apps are compliant with organizational security requirements.
- Create and distribute digital policies that help keep company data safe on organization-owned and personal devices.
- Use a single, unified mobile solution that enforces policies and helps manage devices, apps, users, and groups.
- Ensure that corporate services are easily available to users on all the devices they use.
- Protect company information by helping control the way the workforce accesses and shares its data.
- Ensure that users get a first-class support experience for the products they need to use, such as Office and Edge.

By implementing a management infrastructure, you can provide your users with IT services, apps, protection, and configuration to help make them more productive. For instance, users can automatically get their certificates, wireless network profiles, and virtual private network (VPN) settings without having to manually configure them. Users can be more productive because they don't have to do any manual configuration, and are better protected because they have the right settings.

Microsoft Intune combines these services and tools. You might know and already be using services and tools like Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, co-management, and Windows Autopilot. These services are part of the Microsoft 365 stack of services that help protect your organization's endpoints by securing access, protecting data, and responding to and managing risk.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn about:
- The endpoints that you can protect with Intune and Configuration Manager.
- The products, services, and capabilities that make up Microsoft Intune.
- What Microsoft Intune can do for you and your organization.
