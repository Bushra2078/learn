Windows Autopilot simplifies enrolling devices in Intune by letting you provide the enrollment details before the end user receives a new computer. The Windows Autopilot process runs immediately after a new computer powers on for the first time, and helps the user configure the device to be business-ready in a few steps. You can also use Windows Autopilot to reset, repurpose, and recover devices.

By using cloud-based services, you can:

- Automatically join devices to Microsoft Entra ID.
- Auto-enroll devices into MDM services such as Microsoft Intune.
- Restrict rights on the device.
- Auto-assign devices to configuration groups.
- Customize specific out-of-box-experience (OOBE) content for your organization.

By using a collection of cloud-based technologies, Windows Autopilot:

- Reduces the time IT spends on deploying, managing, and retiring devices.
- Reduces the infrastructure required to maintain the devices.
- Maximizes ease of use for end users.

The only interaction required from the end user is to connect to a network and verify their credentials. Everything beyond that is automated. From the user's perspective, it only takes a few simple operations to make their device ready to use.
