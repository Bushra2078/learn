Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps you protect the digital resources that your organization uses. These resources include devices, apps, and data. You protect these resources based on settings related to these resources. You use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center to configure the settings that are then applied based on the devices, apps, and users of your organization. Those settings are contained in policies that you create. You assign the policies to groups that you define. And, those groups are either users or devices.

Suppose that you're the administrator of a company with several thousand employees. Your company requires that each device must use a PIN to access the device as a extra safety requirement. This must be implemented for all devices that access your corporate network, whether the device is company owned or personally owned. Also, you need to be able to reset the PINs when users are locked out of their devices. You plan to use Microsoft Intune to add this capability as a requirement to all devices that access organization data. Any devices that doesn't accept this requirement is not permitted to access your company's data. 

Here, you'll learn how Intune configuration policies can be used to manage and protect devices, apps, and data.
