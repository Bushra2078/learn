It lets you protect your organization by controlling features and settings on Android, Android Enterprise, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Windows 10 devices. It integrates closely with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and access control and also Azure Information Protection to help protect your organization's data. If you have on-premises infrastructure, such as Exchange or an Active Directory, you can use Intune connectors to help you connect to external services. Intune is included in Microsoft's [Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) suite](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security?azure-portal=true).
