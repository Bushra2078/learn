It lets you protect your organization by controlling features and settings on Android, Android Enterprise, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Windows 10/11 devices. Intune is included in Microsoft's [Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) suite](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security?azure-portal=true).

Intune integrates closely with Microsoft Entra ID for identity and access control. It integrates with Azure Information Protection to help protect your organization's data.
