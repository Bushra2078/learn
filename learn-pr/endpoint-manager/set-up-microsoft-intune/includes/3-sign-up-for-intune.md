When you sign up for the Intune free trial, you create a new Intune trial subscription that uses your work or school account. The trial subscription lasts 30 days. If you choose, you can convert the trial subscription to a full subscription based on your choice of product licenses. If you're already using your work or school account for a Microsoft service, you can *Sign in* with that account and add Intune to your subscription. If you're uncertain whether you have an existing account, you can follow the Intune free trial sign-up steps to check.

>[!WARNING]
>You can't combine an existing work or school account after you sign up for a new account.

When you complete the sign-up process, you have a new tenant. A tenant is a dedicated instance of Microsoft Entra ID that hosts your subscription to Intune. You can then configure the tenant, add users and groups, and assign licenses to users. When you're ready, you can help users enroll their devices and add apps that they need to begin the modern endpoint management process. As you continue, you can set configuration and protection policies, and other endpoint management capabilities.
