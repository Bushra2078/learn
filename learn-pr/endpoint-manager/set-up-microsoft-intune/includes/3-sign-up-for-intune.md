When you sign up for the Intune free trial, you create a new Intune trial subscription using your work or school account. The trial subscription last 30 days. If you choose, you can convert the trial subscription to a full subscription based on your choice of product licenses. If you already are using your work or school account for a Microsoft service, you can **sign in** with that account and add Intune to your subscription. If you're uncertain whether you have an existing account, you can follow the Intune free trial sign-up steps below to check whether you need to create a new account for Intune.

>[!WARNING]
>You can't combine an existing work or school account after you sign up for a new account.

When you complete the sign up process, you'll have a new tenant. A tenant is a dedicated instance of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) where your subscription to Intune is hosted. You can then configure the tenant, add users and groups, and assign licenses to users. When you're ready, you can help users enroll their devices and add apps that they need to begin the modern endpoint management process. As you continue, you can set configuration and protection policies, as well as other endpoint management capabilities.
