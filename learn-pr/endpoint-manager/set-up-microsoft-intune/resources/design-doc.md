## Summary

Microsoft Intune, which is a part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager, provides the cloud infrastructure, the cloud-based mobile device management (MDM), the cloud-based mobile application management (MAM), and the cloud-based PC management for your organization. It lets you protect your organization by controlling features and settings on Android, Android Enterprise, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Windows 10 devices. It integrates closely with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and access control and also Azure Information Protection to help protect your organization's data. If you have on-premises infrastructure, such as Exchange or an Active Directory, you can use Intune connectors to help you connect to external services. Intune is included in Microsoft's [Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) suite](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security?azure-portal=true).

In this module, you'll step through the process of setting up Microsoft Intune. Also, this module will provide the choices and considerations you need to make when setting up an endpoint management solution such as Intune. When you're complete, you'll have a better understanding of Intune's supported configurations. You'll have signed up for the Microsoft Intune's free trial. You'll add end users, define user groups, assign licenses to users, and configure the other needed settings to begin using Microsoft Intune. All of these steps will prepare you to add and manage devices and apps using Intune.
