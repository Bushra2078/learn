Microsoft Endpoint Manager allows you to manage and secure your organization's cloud and on-premises devices, apps, and data. As part of this management, you can use Endpoint Manager to protect device data, manage assignments, ensure proper device access, implement device security rules, and resolve device compliance issues.

In this module, you've learned about device management using Microsoft Endpoint Manager. Here are some of the things you covered:
- Provisioning is a process when your organization issues new or repurposed devices to individuals in your organization. 
- There are several methods to enroll your workforce's devices. Each method depends on device ownership (personal or corporate), device type or platform (iOS/iPadOS, Windows, Android, macOS), and device management requirements (resets, affinity, locking). These methods are explained below.
- When you configure devices in your organization, you can apply settings and features to be enabled or disabled. 
- Protecting devices from unauthorized access is one of the most important tasks that you perform.
- There are a number of ways you can retire a device, including resetting the device, removing it from management, and wiping the corporate data on it.
