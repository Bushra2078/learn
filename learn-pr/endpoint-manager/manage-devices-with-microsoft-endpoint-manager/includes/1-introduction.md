As part of device management, Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps you protect device data, manage policy assignments, ensure proper device access, implement device security rules, and resolve device compliance issues.

All devices that you manage have a lifecycle. Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager can help you manage this lifecycle: from enrollment, through configuration and protection, to retiring the device when it's no longer required.

Suppose that you're the administrator of a company with several thousand employees. Your company requires that all new devices be set up to easily connect to your corporate network before they reach the respective employee. Also, each device must be enrolled into a mobile device management solution so it can be protected. In addition, all of these devices must meet your company's security requirements. These requirements must be implemented for all devices that access your corporate data, whether the device is company owned or personally owned.

Here, you'll learn about provisioning, as well as managing, devices throughout the device lifecycle so that end users can be as productive and organization data can be protected.
