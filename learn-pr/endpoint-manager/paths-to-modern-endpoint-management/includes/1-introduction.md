This module helps explain the basic paths you can follow to migrate from your existing endpoint management state to Microsoft Endpoint Manager. 

Microsoft Endpoint Manager is a single, modern, integrated management platform for managing, protecting, and monitoring all of your organization's endpoints.

Endpoints include the mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, and servers that your organization uses. Additionally, endpoints also include the apps used by your organization. 

By protecting and monitoring your organization's endpoints using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you accomplish the following actions:
- Protect the data that the people at your organization are accessing.
- Ensure your organization is using proper credentials to access and share company data.
- Safeguard the devices and apps that access your organization resources.
- Confirm security rules are in place based on your organizations requirements. 

The Microsoft Endpoint Manager console helps keep your organization's cloud and on-premises devices, apps, and data secure. Endpoint Manager integrates Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Desktop Analytics, and Windows Autopilot. In addition, Microsoft Endpoint Manager integrates with specific technologies, such as Office 365, Microsoft Defender ATP, Azure Active Directory, and Azure Information Protection.

Suppose that you're the administrator or business decision maker of a company with several thousand employees. Your company must determine the best path to manage end users devices, apps, and data. You currently have no Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. You need to keep your corporate data safe by protecting data, apps, and devices that your employees use, and maximize the return on your investment. Learn how Microsoft Endpoint Manager can be a part of your device management migration path.
