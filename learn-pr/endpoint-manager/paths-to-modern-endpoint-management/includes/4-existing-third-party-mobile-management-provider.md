If you're using an existing cloud-based mobile device management provider, you should consider moving your existing endpoints and workloads to Microsoft Intune to achieve modern endpoint management.

> [!NOTE]
> Devices should only have one Mobile Device Management (MDM) provider.

As previously mentioned in this module, Microsoft Intune is available within Microsoft Endpoint Manager. It is a modern cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) provider for your devices and apps. It lets you protect your organization by controlling features and settings on Android, Android Enterprise, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Windows 10 devices. It integrates closely with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and access control, as well as Azure Information Protection for data protection.

## Benefits of using Intune

By moving your additional endpoint to Intune to manage your organization's endpoints, you gain the following benefits:
- No need to setup and operate your own management infrastructure.
- Native integration with cloud-powered security controls and risk-based conditional access for apps and data.
- Flexible support for diverse corporate and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios, while increasing productivity and collaboration.
- Maximize your investment and accelerate time to value with fast rollout of services and devices with end-to-end integration across familiar Microsoft stack.
