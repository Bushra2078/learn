Many organizations have existing policies and device management infrastructure that's only being "maintained". For example, you might have 20-year-old group policies, and don't have the details about why they were added, or possibly what they do. When considering a move to the cloud, instead of looking at what you've always done, determine the goal.

> [!TIP]
> If you're currently using multiple device management solutions, now might be the time to upgrade to a single modern mobile device management solution such as Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

To determine your future endpoint management plan, you can start by assessing your existing endpoint structure:

- Inventory your current endpoint management tasks and policies
- Determine which of your endpoint management tasks and policies that you run on-premises could be run in the cloud.
- Determine an endpoint management baseline plan that covers your minimum endpoint management goals.
- Determine which Intune or Configuration Manager policies would allow your endpoint management baseline plan to be implemented.
- Review the current structure of your organization's device and user groups.
- Determine the structure of the new groups that you can create in Endpoint Manager.

To determine the specific tasks you can following to successfully assess your existing and future endpoint management and infrastructure, see [Microsoft Intune planning guide - Review existing policies and infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/intune-planning-guide?azure-portal=true#task-4-review-existing-policies-and-infrastructure)
