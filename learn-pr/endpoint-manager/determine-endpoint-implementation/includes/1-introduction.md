A successful endpoint-management deployment or migration starts with having a good plan. This module helps you consider and design your endpoint-management plan. When you've completed the module, you'll have a better understanding of your endpoint-management objectives, your device inventory considerations, the licensing involved, the policies and infrastructure needed, the rollout plan to consider, and more.

The Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center helps keep your organization's cloud and on-premises devices, apps, and data secure. By using Endpoint Manager, you gain the capabilities and benefits of Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Desktop Analytics, and Windows Autopilot, as well as several related technologies.

Suppose that you're the administrator or business decision maker of a company with several thousand employees. Your company must determine an appropriate implementation plan to manage end users' devices, apps, and data. You currently have a limited Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. You need to keep your corporate data safe by protecting the data, apps, and devices that your employees use, as well as keeping your employees productive and maximizing the return on your investment. Here, you'll learn how Microsoft Endpoint Manager can be a part of your device-management implementation plan.
