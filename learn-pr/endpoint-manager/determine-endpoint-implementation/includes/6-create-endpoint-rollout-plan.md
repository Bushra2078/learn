After you've determined how to implement policies and tasks for the groups of end users at your organization, you can begin to formulate a rollout plan. A rollout is a staged process of actions. Your endpoint-management rollout plan identifies the organizational groups and time frames you want to target, the rollout phases for each group, and the enrollment approaches you'll use.

## Targeted organizational groups and time frames

First, determine the groups of users you need to target with your Endpoint Manager rollout. Second, determine the rollout time frame for each targeted group. This task typically requires a discussion between the Endpoint Manager deployment team and the targeted groups to determine the most appropriate rollout time frame for each group. Points to cover in such a discussion include:

* Group's willingness for change
* Number of users and devices
* Types of device platforms
* Requirements
* Geographic location
* Business risk

## Rollout phases

Organizations commonly choose to start the Endpoint Manager rollout with an initial pilot, targeting a small group of users in the IT department. You can expand the pilot to include a broader set of IT users and may include participation from other organizational groups.

The first step when determining rollout phases is to determine your goals and success metrics of each rollout phase. Make sure goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely). Plan to measure against your goals at each phase so your rollout project stays on track. Make sure your rollout goals meet your overall objectives. Include these objectives in all awareness and training activities so users understand why your organization chose Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

### Pilot

The first phase to roll out should be to pilot users. The pilot users should understand they're the first users in a new solution. They must be willing to provide feedback to help improve configuration, documentation, and notifications, as well as ease the way for all other users in later rollout phases. These users should not be executives or VIPs.

### Production rollout

After a successful pilot, you're ready to start a full production rollout, targeting the rest of your organization's groups. Some examples of different rollout groups include **Departments**, **Geography**, and **Platform**.

## Match rollout groups to enrollment approaches

Now that you've determined the targeted groups and time frames for your Endpoint Manager rollout, the next step is to choose the most appropriate Endpoint Manager enrollment approach for each group. There are different enrollment approaches you can use, including:

* User self-service
* User assisted-enrollment
* IT tech fair
