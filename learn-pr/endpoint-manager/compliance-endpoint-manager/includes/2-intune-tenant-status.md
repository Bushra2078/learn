The Microsoft Intune Tenant Status page is a centralized hub where you can view current and important details about your tenant. A tenant is a representation of an organization. It's a dedicated instance of Azure AD that an organization receives when the organization signs up for Microsoft Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the underlying infrastructure that supports identity management for all Microsoft cloud services. Azure AD stores information about license assignment states for users. Your subscription to Intune is hosted by an Azure AD Tenant.

Tenant details provide at-a-glance information about your tenant. View details like your tenant name and location, your MDM Authority, and your tenants service release number. The service release number is a link that opens the *What's new in Intune* article on Microsoft Learn. In *What's new*, you can read about the latest features and updates to the Intune service. The tenant status also provides the total end user licenses in use and available.
