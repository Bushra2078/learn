title:  Classify endangered bird species with Custom Vision
summary: As an ornithologist, you study the behavior, physiology, and conservation of birds and bird habitat. Your work often involves surveying, recording, and reporting on bird activity. You want to build a machine learning model that will identify a bird in an image by species, to help with gathering data. In this module, you use Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision to create a model to identify species of birds!
