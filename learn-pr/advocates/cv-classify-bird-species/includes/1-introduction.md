As a ornithologist you study the behavior, physiology, and conservation of birds and bird habitats. This work often involves surveying, recording and reporting on bird activity.

You want to build a ML model that will identify the birds to help with gathering data. We will be using the NA Bird dataset from Cornell to train a model that will recognize bird species and help you document the different trends and patterns of the bird habits.

In this module, you will use Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision to create a model to identify species of birds, in all their variety. Learning more about birds is a great way to educate yourself and others about natural phenomena in your local area.

Data provided by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, with a special thanks to photographers, contributors, and visitors to the [All About Birds website](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/). This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1010818. This module includes a subset of the full dataset. To access the full dataset, please visit [this site](https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds), and please refer to [this paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Horn_Building_a_Bird_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf) for specific dataset details.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Get an introduction to Computer Vision
- Get an introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
- Learn how to use prebuilt ML models in Azure called Cognitive Services
- Lear how to use the Custom Vision Cognitive Service
- Create a Node App with VS Code to interact with the Cognivive service SDK's in JavaScript
- Build a custom machine learning model
- Operationalize the model created with Custom Vision
