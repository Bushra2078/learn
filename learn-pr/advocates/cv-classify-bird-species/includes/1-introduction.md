As a ornithologist you study the behavior, physiology, and conservation of birds and bird habitats. This work often involves surveying, recording and reporting on bird activity.

You want to build a ML model that will identify the top 10 most endangered birds to help with gathering data. You need to get a dataset and train a model that will recognize the bird species and help document the different trends and patterns of the bird habits.

In this module, you will use Azure Cognitive Service Bing Search API to scrape a dataset of bird images by species and then use Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision to identify species of birds, in all their variety. Learning more about birds is a great way to educate yourself and others about natural phenomena in your local area.

Here are some additional data options when thinking about building models for birds:
