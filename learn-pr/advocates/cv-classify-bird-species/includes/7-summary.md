Congratulations! You created a Custom Vision machine learning model that will help you identify and document birds and better protect endangered bird species!

In this module, we covered an introduction to machine learning and Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision. Then, we went through the process of building a fully functioning machine learning model. 

Don't let the learning stop here! There are many more Microsoft Learn machine learning modules to help you learn more about building models.

Happy bird watching!
