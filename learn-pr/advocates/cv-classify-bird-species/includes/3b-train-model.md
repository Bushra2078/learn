We've created our dataset in Custom Vision. Now, we can train our model. 

## Build the model: Train the model

You could train the model by using the SDK, but we'll use the Custom Vision portal to train our model.

1. In the [Custom Vision portal](https://www.customvision.ai/?azure-portal=true), select the **Bird Classification** project.

1. In the top menu bar, select **Train**.

1. In **Choose Training Type**, select **Quick Training**, and then select **Train**.

During the training process, an **Iterations** pane appears on the left. A **Trainingâ€¦** notification in the pane indicates that training is in progress. When training finishes, information about how the model performed for the training iteration is shown.

Details about the training iteration are displayed through metrics called _precision_, _recall_, and _average precision (AP)_. The metrics are shown for the whole model and for each class (tag). In the next unit, we'll learn more about these metrics.
