We are going to be using an Azure service that creates a model using Computer Vision. Lets learn a little bit more about how Computer Vision works and how the service uses Transfer Learning to increase accuracy with less data.

## What is Machine Learning?

You've most likely heard about AI, Machine Learning, or Deep Learning before. However, you may not be clear about what they mean and the differences between them. Let's break it down!

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** is a technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence. It includes machine learning. We're simply trying to mimic human intelligence with a machine and includes different techniques. The one we're focusing on is Machine Learning.

**Machine learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses techniques that enable machines to use experience. Think of experience as a dataset used to improve at tasks. It includes what is called Deep learning.

**Deep learning (DL)** is a subset of machine learning that's based on artificial neural networks. The learning process is deep because the structure of artificial neural networks consists of multiple input, output, and hidden layers. Each layer contains units that transform the input data into information that the next layer can use for a certain predictive task. The neural network structure allows a machine to learn through it's own data processing.

In summary, when we build a model we're trying to mimic human intelligence. We use data as "experience" to train a model to learn a specific task or function.
