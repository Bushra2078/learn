  title: Answer the questions below to check your understanding.
  questions:
    - content: "What is the purpose of Artificial Intelligence?"
      choices:
        - content: "To build Skynet."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect! Skynet is from a movie and not real."
        - content: "To mimic human intelligence with a computer."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Which of the following options is <i>not</i> an indicator that custom vision provides to understand how the model is performing?"
      choices:
        - content: "Confusion Matrix"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! A confusion matrix is a valid metric, but it is not provided by custom vision."
        - content: "Recall"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. A recall metric is provided."
        - content: "AP"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. An AP metric is provided."
        - content: "Precision"
          isCorrect: false

          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Good data is key to making a good machine learning model."
        - content: "Too much data"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. More data is better if the data is good data."
        - content: "Using unseen (new) data to test"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You always want to test with unseen (new) data."
    - content: "The model should not be deployed until it has perfect results and is 100% accurate on all classes."
      choices:
        - content: "False"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! You will have to make the decision of when the model is performing 'good enough' for the problem you are trying to solve."
        - content: "True"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There is always some error in models; they will never be perfect."
