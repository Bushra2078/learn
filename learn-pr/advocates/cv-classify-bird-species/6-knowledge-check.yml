  title: Answer the questions below to check your understanding.
  questions:
    - content: "What is the purpose of Artificial Intelligence?"
      choices:
        - content: "To build Skynet."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect! This is from a movie and not real."
        - content: "To mimic human intelligence with a computer."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: " Which of the following is _not_ an indicator that custom vision provides to understand how the model is performing?"
      choices:
        - content: "Confusion Matrix"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! This is a valid metric but is not provided by custom vision."
        - content: "Recall"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This metric is provided."
        - content: "AP"

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You always want to test with unseen (new) data."
    - content: "The model should not be deployed until it has perfect results and is 100% accuracy on all classes"
      choices:
        - content: "False"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! You will have to make the decision of when the model is performing 'good enough' for the problem you are trying to solve."
        - content: "True"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There is always some error in models, they will never be perfect."
