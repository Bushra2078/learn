  title: Answer the questions below to check your understanding.
  questions:
    - content: "What is the purpose of artificial Intelligence?"
      choices:
        - content: "To build Skynet."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect! Skynet is from a movie and isn't real."
        - content: "To mimic human intelligence with a computer."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Which of the following options <i>isn't</i> an indicator that Azure Custom Vision provides to help you understand how well the model performs?"
      choices:
        - content: "Confusion Matrix"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! A confusion matrix is a valid metric, but it isn't provided by Azure Custom Vision."
        - content: "recall"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The recall metric is provided."
        - content: "AP"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The AP metric is provided."
        - content: "precision"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The precision metric is provided."
    - content: "What's a common rookie mistake?"
      choices:
        - content: "Using bad data."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Good data is key to making a good machine learning model."
        - content: "Using too much data."
          isCorrect: false

        - content: "Using unseen (new) data to test."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You always want to test with unseen (new) data."
    - content: "The model shouldn't be deployed until it has perfect results and is 100% accurate on all classes."
      choices:
        - content: "False"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! You must decide when the model is performing <i>good enough</i> for the problem you are trying to solve."
