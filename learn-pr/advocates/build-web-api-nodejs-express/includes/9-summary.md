You started by evaluating the http core module in Node.js and saw how it was capable of processing requests. As part of processing the requests, it was able to receive and send both headers and data back to the calling client.

You then learned the PROs of using a Web framework like Express and gained some knowledge on its features and important concepts.

Express is able to handle numerous things like route management, how to construct different types of responses to handle the upload and download of files. Additionally, it's able to handle the lifecycle of a request to perform tasks such as logging or acting on authentication credentials.

You were able to get a feel for most of the above topics in a series of exercises and should now feel fairly confident in how to create a RESTful API using Express and Node.js. As part of learning to construct APIs, you looked at different ways of interacting with your API. You found that you could use a Browser, code, or a client like cURL to send requests.

You also understand that there is more to learn on the topic of creating APIs, especially in securing your API.  At this point, you should have some good foundations on building Web Application with Express and is nicely set up for deepening your knowledge.
