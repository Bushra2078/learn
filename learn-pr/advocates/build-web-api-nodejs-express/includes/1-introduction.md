Using the Web as a platform to run your application means anyone can reach it using a browser or by using a client or software that can speak HTTP - that is powerful.

Clear your mind and picture this: you work as a developer for an enormous online retailer called “Tailwind Traders”. Tailwind is building a new set of HTTP APIs for their application built on Node.js. They’ve asked you to build them an API that lists all of the products that they sell so that applications can work with that data.

It is entirely possible to construct a Web page using nothing but HTML pages, JavaScript, and CSS. Node.js has a core module called HTTP that helps you construct web applications. It supports most things you will try to do like handling requests for reading, writing, and working with different types of content.

Being a developer is not only about solving problems but also being as fast and efficient as possible, doing so. That means you need to know your tools, how to version your code, and sometimes pick a framework that will achieve a faster and more reliable result. This is one of those times. Even though the HTTP module in Node.js is capable, it's not as fast as using a framework.

So for you to be fast and efficient and handle more complex topics like authentication/authorization - life will be a lot easier if you use a framework.

There are many web frameworks created for Node.js that you could use like Hapi, Fastify, Koa, and Express for example. The framework Express is used by many developers. It is also the framework you will use throughout this module. It has been around for a long time and had some time to mature. This means the APIs are well thought out, security issues have been patched, and so on and so forth.

In this module, you’ll learn about how to handle HTTP requests with Node.js. You’ll also learn about the Express framework, which enables the building of websites and HTTP APIs.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the core concepts of the web framework Express
- Configure middleware to control how a request is handled
- Respond to HTTP requests with different types of content like text and JSON
- Send data to an Express endpoint

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer
- Familiarity with editing text and code files in any text editor
- Basic familiarity with the HTTP protocol
- Experience using the command line, including Git operations
