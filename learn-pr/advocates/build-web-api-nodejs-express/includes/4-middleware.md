In some cases, when a request reaches a web application, you might need to verify that the user is logged in or that they are allowed to see the particular resource.

## Request steps

Think of handling a request as a series of steps. If the user needs to be logged in to handle a resource, the steps might look like this:

1. **Pre request**: Investigate whether the user sent the proper credentials through a request header. If the credentials are verified, send the request to the next step.
1. **Construct the response**: Talk to some kind of data source, like a database or an endpoint. This step returns the resource, as long as the request asks for the resource correctly.
1. **Post request**: This is an optional step to run a piece of code after the request is handled. You might run this step for logging purposes.

The Express framework has built-in support for handling a request in this way. To run a pre or post request, implement the **use()** method on your Express instantiated object. A pre or post request in Express is known as a *middleware*, and has the following shape:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {})
```

The method passed into **use()** has three parameters, **req**, **res**, and **next**. The parameters have the following meanings:

- **req**: This parameter is the incoming request. It contains request headers and the calling URL. It might also have a body of data if the client sent data with their request.
- **res**: This parameter is a response stream. Use this stream to write information, such as headers and data that you want to send back to the calling client.
- **next**: This parameter signals that the request is OK and that you are ready to process it. If **next()** isn't called, processing of the request stops. Also, it's good practice to tell the client why the request is not processed, for example, call **res.send('\<specify a reason why the request is stopped>'\)**.

## Request pipeline

If you have routes that could benefit from having middleware run pre or post a request, set it up so that:

- Middleware that needs to run before the request (pre request) is defined before the actual request.
- Middleware that needs to run after the request (post request) is defined after the actual request.

Take a look at this example:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // pre request
})
app.get('/protected-resource', () => {
  // handling the actual request
})
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // post request
})

app.get('/login', () => {})
```

You can also run pre request middleware code as an argument to the request handling, like this:

```javascript
app.get(
  '/<some route>',
 () => {
   // pre request middleware
 }, () => {
   // handling the actual request
 })
```
