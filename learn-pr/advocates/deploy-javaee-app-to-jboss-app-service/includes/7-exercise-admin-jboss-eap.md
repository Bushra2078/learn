In this exercise, we access the JBoss Admin graphical interface and stream its logs

### Create a TCP Tunnel for connecting  to Remote Server

To access to the remote server, you can create a TCP Tunnel between your remote server and your local machine.
Execute the following command:

```azurecli
$ az webapp create-remote-connection -n jakartaee-app-on-jboss-1606464084546 \
  -g jakartaee-app-on-jboss-1606464084546-rg

Verifying if app is running....
App is running. Trying to establish tunnel connection...
Opening tunnel on port: 59445
SSH is available { username: root, password: Docker! }
Ctrl + C to close
```

Then you'll get the following information from the command result:

|  Required Information  |  Value  |
| ---- | ---- |
|  Opening tunnel on port  |  PORT_NUMBER (ex. 59445)  |
|  username  |  root  |
|  password  |  Docker!  |

### SSH with TCP Tunnel

Then you can sign in to the Server by using `ssh` command.
Open a new command terminal and execute the following command.

```bash
ssh  root@127.0.0.1  -L 9990:localhost:9990 -p $PORT_NUMBER (ex. 59445)
```

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to access to the JBoss EAP Admin Web Console, please specify the `-L 9990:localhost:9990` options. Then you can access to the `http://localhost:9990/console` for Web Console. If you don't need to login the JBoss Web Console, you can remove the "-L" option.

Then you can see following messages and you could sign in to the Server:

```bash
The authenticity of host '[127.0.0.1]:59445 ([127.0.0.1]:59445)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:vHsp1b3+7NtnHISvZ6aKS82pww+e5L6CUc9fKaPZGDQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[127.0.0.1]:59445' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@127.0.0.1's password:

**NOTE**: No files or system changes outside of /home will persist beyond your application's current session. /home is your application's persistent storage and is shared across all the server instances.


-bash-4.2# 
```

### Execute JBoss CLI Command

After signing in to the remote server, you can execute the JBoss EAP Admin CLI Tool as `jboss-cli.sh`.
The CLI command is located on `/opt/eap/bin/` directory.
Connect to JBoss EAP by using following command:

```bash
-bash-4.2# /opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect
Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Xmx2402M -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true 
```

After connecting to the JBoss EAP Server, execute the JBoss CLI command to get the Product Information:

```bash
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] :product-info
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [{"summary" => {
        "host-name" => "05b2037f748e",
        "instance-identifier" => "895f0c88-5c7d-440f-9e45-e972f5cc14a5",
        "product-name" => "JBoss EAP",
        "product-version" => "7.2.9.GA",
        "product-community-identifier" => "Product",
        "product-home" => "/opt/eap",
        "last-update-date" => "8/27/20 1:09 PM",
        "standalone-or-domain-identifier" => "STANDALONE_SERVER",
        "host-operating-system" => "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.8 (Ma
ipo)",
        "host-cpu" => {
            "host-cpu-arch" => "amd64",
            "host-core-count" => 1
        },
        "jvm" => {
            "name" => "OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM",
            "java-version" => "1.8",
            "jvm-version" => "1.8.0_262",
            "jvm-vendor" => "Oracle Corporation",
            "java-home" => "/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.262.b10-0
.el7_8.x86_64/jre"
        }
    }}]
}
```

Get all of the deployed Applications from following command:

```bash
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] ls deployment
ROOT.war          activemq-rar.rar  
```

Test the DB connection with the following command:

```bash
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source="JPAWorldDataSourceDS":test-connection-in-pool
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [true]
}
```

### Access the JBoss EAP Admin Web Console

You can also access the JBossAdmin Web Console.
First, create an admin user and password for authentication:

```bash
-bash-4.2# /opt/eap/bin/add-user.sh -u admin -p admin -r ManagementRealm
```

Then you can access to the Web Console from your Local environment.
Using a browser, access the following URL:

```html
http://127.0.0.1:9990/console
```

Then you'll see the following Sign-on Screen and you can sign in with the previously created user name and password:

:::image type="content" source="../media/jboss-admin-console1.png" alt-text="Admin Console Auth Window":::

After signing in to the Web Console, you'll see the following screen:

:::image type="content" source="../media/jboss-admin-console2.png" alt-text="Admin Console Top Page":::

You can confirm your created Datasource from `Configuration` -> `Subsystems` -> `Datasources & Drivers` -> `Datasources`.

:::image type="content" source="../media/jboss-admin-console3.png" alt-text="Admin Console DataSources List":::

You can also confirm your RESTful endpoints of your application from `Runtime` -> `system` -> `JAX-RS` -> `Your Application`.

:::image type="content" source="../media/jboss-admin-console4.png" alt-text="Admin Console RESTful Endpoint":::

> [!WARNING]
> If you directly access to the Remote Server via JBoss CLI command or Web Console and add or update some configurations, the configuration will be clear and deleted after the container is rebooted. To persist the configuration, configure this in the Start up script.
For example, we created the `createMySQLDataSource.sh` in previous section as a startup script.

## Open a Log stream

Next let's sign in to the server and access the Application log.
You can access the Application sign in your local machine, by executing the following command:

```azurecli
az webapp log tail --name ${WEBAPP_NAME} \
 --resource-group ${RESOURCEGROUP_NAME}
```

After executing the above command, you'll get your log output:

```azurecli
az webapp log tail  -n jakartaee-app-on-jboss-1606464084546 \
  -g jakartaee-app-on-jboss-1606464084546-rg

## Exercise Summary

In this unit, you learned how to configure and deploy a Java EE 8 (Jakarta EE) Application to JBoss EAP on Azure App Service.
Then we created a `DataSource` for connecting MySQL to JBoss EAP in a startup script.
We also learned how to access to the Remote Server from both CLI and GUI by a TCP Tunnel.
Finally, we accessed the log file from our local machine.
