In this unit, we'll introduce Java EE applications and the modules learning goals.

Java EE applications are used in enterprises such as purchase management, manufacturing, and CRM.
An example is a freight delivery system.
Your service receives a package and captures the shipping address information and register the delivery address.
Many enterprises create similar services that query and update data from databases.

In this module, you'll create a sample database on `Azure Database for MySQL`. You'll create and deploy a `Java EE (Jakarta EE) Application` to `JBoss EAP on Azure App Service`. Finally you'll learn how to manage the `JBoss EAP on Azure App Service`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you can:

- Create and manage Azure Database for MySQL
