## What is a GitHub Action?

A GitHub Action is a tool available within GitHub's repositories that help to automate software workflows. With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your code from within GitHub. For the purposes of this module you will use a GitHub Action to trigger a build process when new code is pushed to your app's repository.
