## What is Custom Vision AI?

A common application of machine learning algorithms is to classify images. There are various ways to do this, including writing manual code using libraries such as TensorFlow. [Custom Vision AI](https://www.customvision.ai), a tool created by Microsoft, however, makes this task much easier.

Custom Vision AI uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. The developer submits batches of images and labels them. Then the service trains a model on your images and calculates its accuracy. You can test, retrain, and eventually use this service to classify new images. You can also export the model itself for offline use, which is what you will do in this module.
