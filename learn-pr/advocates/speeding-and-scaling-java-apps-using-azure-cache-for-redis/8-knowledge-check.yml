  questions:
    - content: "What are the main recommended use cases for using Azure Cache for Redis?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use Azure Cache for Redis as distributed cache."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You are partially right, but this answer is not the only reason."
        - content: "Use Azure Cache for Redis as an HTTP session data store."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You are partially right, but this answer is not the only reason."
        - content: "Use Azure Cache for Redis as a message broker."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You are partially right, but this answer is not the only reason."
        - content: "All of the above."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Azure Cache for Redis can be used as a distributed cache, an HTTP session data store, and a message broker."
    - content: "How does Azure Cache for Redis allow to scale out a Web application?"
      choices:
        - content: "It uses IP multicast to find other application nodes and share data among them."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Some alternate caching solutions use this mechanism, but not Azure Cache for Redis, as it doesn't work well in cloud environment."
        - content: "It acts as a central and scalable data store, where all application nodes can store and retrieve cached data."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. All nodes can store and retrieve data at scale by connecting to Azure Cache for Redis."
        - content: "It sends messages to every application nodes to invalidate stale data, so they can then retrieve that data from an persistent database."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Some alternate caching solutions use this mechanism, but not Azure Cache for Redis."
        - content: "It stores cached data in a SQL database, so that application nodes can retrieve it easily."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Spring Session can use an SQL database to store its data, but it's an alternative and less performant solution than Azure Cache for Redis."
