This course has covered basic information on bots and [Azure Bot Service][Azure Bot Service]. We also looked at [guidelines for conversational AI][Microsoft guidelines for conversational AI]. Through those principles, we learned several ways to improve a bot by making it responsible:

- Programming it to state its purpose and make it clear that it's a bot
- Designing it to support diverse users and treat people fairly
- Making it sensitive to cultural norms

Next we started to build a customer service bot. We edited a sample bot's code to make it more responsible. We changed its welcome message to clearly state the bot's purpose. We also programmed the bot to greet users by name. Implementing a complete bot is out of scope for this module.

Finally, we deployed the bot in Azure.

From a technological point of view, you learned how to:

- Create a bot from a sample in the C# programming language.
- Make the bot responsible by using Visual Studio to edit the bot's code.
- Deploy the bot by using the Azure CLI to create an Azure Bot resource to host the bot.
- Engage in a chat session by using Web Chat.
- Connect the bot to communication channels like Telegram.

Remember, [Azure Bot Service][Azure Bot Service] can host your bot and make it accessible on communication channels. It's up to you and other developers to make bots responsible.

This course has provided you with the basic tools and experience you need for bot deployment. We hope it equips you to build useful, responsible bots that benefit your users and organization.
