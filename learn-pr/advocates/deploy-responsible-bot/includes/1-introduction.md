Bots provide many benefits to organizations:

- They save time and money by efficiently completing repetitive tasks in a consistent way.
- When bots take over low-level, tedious assignments, employees can focus on more creative, higher-level work.

Many bots work behind the scenes, making systems more efficient and secure. Examples include bots that index search engines or identify malicious requests. Other bots interact with customers and are part of the broader category of conversational AI.

Chatbots that handle customer service duties imitate human user behavior. When bots act like humans, customers can feel personally engaged. Sometimes customers begin to view the bots as people. As a result, it's important for chatbots to be responsible. To provide good customer service, bots need to conduct themselves professionally. They need to treat people fairly and respectfully.

## Scenario: Develop a customer service bot

Customer service bots often collect information from users. For instance, a bot might request a user's name and email address. In this course, we'll start to develop a customer service bot for a hotel reservation system. We'll call our bot **CustomerFriend**.

We won't cover how to create all the functionality for the bot. Instead, we'll focus on deploying the bot. We'll also add features to help our bot interact responsibly with customers.

## What will you learn?

- Learn about the basic building blocks for creating conversational AI for users.
- Create a basic bot from a sample.
- Apply principles of responsible AI to your bot.
- Deploy your bot to Azure.
- Use Web Chat to test your bot.
- Connect your bot to communication channels.

## What is the main objective?

In this course, we'll use Azure Bot Service and the C# programming language to build and deploy a responsible bot.
