In this unit, we'll look at our existing application. It has many components and is designed to implement a variety of features. Hereâ€™s a summary of the capabilities: 

- The application has a standardized way to request text-message temperature alerts for a location if the temperature goes outside a given range.
- For each location, the application can retrieve the low and high temperatures for an upcoming daily weather forecast.
- The application can check the forecast every 12 hours.
- If the temperature in a specified location is forecast to be outside a certain range, the application can send an alert via text message.

## Receive text messages

To support the most users around the world, many of whom may only have access to a basic phone, the application interface uses text messaging. Twilio is a third-party service that can create programmable phone numbers for sending and receiving text messages. Every time a text message is sent to our application's phone number, custom code in Azure is triggered with the help of the Azure Functions service. This code tracks all the locations and temperature ranges that farmers want to know about and keeps it all in table storage.

The code sets up text message alerts in the following format:

```output
location maxTemp minTemp
```

For example, you might want to send "1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 5C 25C" as an alert for the Microsoft corporate headquarters if the temperature will be below 5 degrees Celsius or above 25 degrees Celsius.

## Normalize the location to coordinates (geocoding)

The Azure Maps API [Search - Get Search Address](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/getsearchaddress?azure-portal=true) provides address geocoding. Geocoding is the process of converting from a street address to a geospatial location as longitude and latitude. For example, *1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, USA* gives a longitude of *-122.1282593* and a latitude of *47.6393782*. You can then use this location to get the weather forecast.

## Retrieve a daily weather forecast

Azure Maps has an API called [Weather - Get Daily Forecast](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/weather/getdailyforecastpreview?azure-portal=true). If a geospatial location is specified as longitude and latitude, you can receive the forecast for that location for a specified number of days. We'll use five days as the standard forecast period to allow farmers to make decisions for the next few days.

## Check the forecast every 12 hours

Azure Functions is an event-based service that runs code when it is triggered. These events can be triggered by a variety of actions, from web requests to timers and items that are added to queues or databases. Our application can use a time trigger to check the weather every 12 hours.

When you send a text message to Twilio to subscribe to temperature notifications, Twilio can make a web request to another Azure function that uses an HTTP trigger.

In this unit, you looked at the features of the application. Next, we create an Azure Maps account and set it up to get geocoding and location information for our application.
