To send and receive text messages programmatically, you'll need to get a Twilio account. In this unit, you'll create a free Twilio account.

## Create a Twilio account

1. Go to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com?azure-portal=true).

1. Select the red **Sign Up** button in the upper-right corner.

1. Enter your name, contact information, and a password, and then select **Start your free trial**.

1. Twilio will send you an email to verify your email address. In the email message, select **Confirm your email**, and then log in to Twilio with the email address and password that you entered in the preceding step.

1. Enter your phone number for verification.

   To prevent phone numbers from being used for spam, in a free Twilio account, you can send messages only to verified phone numbers.  

1. Twilio will send you a verification code via text message. On the **Verify Your Identity** page, verify your phone number by entering that code. Then, select **Verify**.

1. Answer a series of questions that are used to create your first Twilio project. Any settings you choose wonâ€™t affect how we'll use Twilio in this module.

1. When your account dashboard is shown, select the **Get a Trial Number** button. Twilio assigns you a phone number to use to send messages.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Assigned numbers might not be able to send messages in some countries. To learn which countries have restrictions, see [Twilio international phone number availability and their capabilities](https://support.twilio.com/hc/articles/223183068-Twilio-international-phone-number-availability-and-their-capabilities?azure-portal=true). For more information about restrictions, see [Using Twilio when SMS numbers are unavailable in your country](https://support.twilio.com/hc/articles/226690868-Using-Twilio-when-SMS-numbers-are-unavailable-in-your-country?azure-portal=true).

1. On your dashboard, copy and save the following values to use later:

   - Trial number
   - Account SID
   - Auth token

In this unit, you created a Twilio account that you'll use to send and receive text messages. Next, you'll learn how to create and deploy a function app in Azure.
