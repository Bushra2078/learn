Node.js has powerful built-in mechanisms for working with the file system.

Assume for a moment that you work for a company called, **Tailwind Traders**. Tailwind Traders is the second largest online retailer in the world. They deal with mountains of data and files. They've hired you (yes you) to help them manage their data and files using Node.js. Congratulations on the new job!

In this module, you will write a program that searches through folders for sales files. When those files are found, you'll use Node.js to read and parse the sales total data inside. Finally, you'll summarize those sales totals into one grand total and write that value to a new file.

- Work with directories
- Create and delete files
- Read from files
- Write to files
