Tailwind Traders is the second largest online retailer in the world. They deal with mountains of data and files. They've hired you (yes you) to help them manage their data and files using Node.js. Congratulations on the new job!

Tailwind Traders collects sales information at the end of each night from each of their brick and mortar locations. Each store reports their sales by sending a file with their sales totals to a central file store.
