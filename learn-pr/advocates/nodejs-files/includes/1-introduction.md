Tailwind Traders is the second largest online retailer in the world. They deal with mountains of data and files. They have hired you (yes you) to help them manage their data and files using Node.js.

Tailwind Traders collects sales information at the end of each night from each of their brick and mortar locations. Each location reports their sales by sending a file with their sales totals to a central location. Tailwind Traders needs to read through each of these files and combine all of the data into a single file that will be loaded into their sales system.

In this module, you'll use Node.js to build a system that Tailwind Traders can use to read all of the files each night and calculate a grand total from all of the stores sales.
