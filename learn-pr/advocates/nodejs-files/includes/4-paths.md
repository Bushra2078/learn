Node.js has a built-in mechanism for working with file system paths.

In the previous exercise, it wasn't too bad because we didn't have many folders to find and look through. But if you had lots of files or folders, manually building paths can get tedious. Node.js provides some built-in constants and utilities to make files paths easier.

Here, you will learn about the Node.js "path" module and the `__dirname` constant so that you can make the program smarter and more resilient.

## Determining the current directory

Sometimes, you don't know the directory where your program will run. You need it to just use the path of the current directory. Node.js exposes the full path to the current directory via the constant `__dirname`.

```javascript
console.log(__dirname);
```

If you executed that code from the "sales" folder in the following folder structure...

```
ðŸ“‚ stores
    ðŸ“‚ 201
        ðŸ“‚ sales
```

...the `_dirname` value will be "/stores/201/sales".

## Working with paths

Paths are a subject that comes up so frequently, Node.js includes a module called "path" specifically for working with paths.

Just like the "fs" module, the "path" module ships with Node.js and doesn't need to be installed. You just need to reference it at the top of your file...

```javascript
const path = require("path");
```

### Joining paths

The "path" module works with the concept of file and folder paths, which are just strings. For instance, if you wanted to get the path to the "stores/201" folder, you can use the path module to do that.

```javascript
console.log(path.join("stores", "201")); // stores/201
```

The reason why you would use the "path" module instead of concatenating strings, is that your program may run on Windows or Linux. The "path" module will always format paths correctly for whatever operating system it's running on. In the example above, `path.join` would return "stores\201" on Windows, with a backslash instead of a slash.

### Determining file extensions

The path module can also tell you what the extension of a given file is. If you had a file and you wanted to identify if it was a JSON file or not, you can use the `path.extname` method.

```javascript
console.log(path.extname("sales.json"));
```

> [!TIP]
> Note the "path" module doesn't care whether or not things actually exist. Paths are conceptual, not physical. It's just building and parsing strings for you.

### Getting everything you need to know about a file or path

The "path" module contains many different methods that do various things. However, you can get most of the information that you need about a path or file by using the "parse" method. This method returns an object that contains the current directory you are in, the name of the file, the file extension, and even the name of the file without the extension.

```javascript
console.log(path.parse("stores/201/sales.json"));
// { root: '',â€ˆdir: 'stores/201',â€ˆbase: 'sales.json',â€ˆext: '.json',â€ˆname: 'sales' }
```

There are many more useful utility methods on the "path" module, but these are the core concepts that you will likely use the most often. In the next exercise, you'll use the "path" module to compose paths and identify ".json" files.
