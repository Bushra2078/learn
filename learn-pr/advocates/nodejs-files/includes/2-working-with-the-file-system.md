Node.js provides a built-in module for working with the file system. It's called the "fs" module. This is short for, you guessed it, "File System".

## Including the fs module

The "fs" module is include by default in Node which means you don't need to install it from npm.

This can be a bit confusing because you can't actually see the "fs" module in your file system or in your "node_modules" folder. So how do you include the "fs" module in a project? You reference it just like you would any other dependency.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
```

The "fs" module allows you to do various operations on files and directories. It has quite a few methods to pick from. For right now, we're just going to focus on what you need to know to work with directories using the "fs" module.

## Listing contents in a directory

One of the things that you'll do with the "fs" module quite a bit is list out or "enumerate" the contents in a given directory. For instance, Tailwind Traders has a root folder called "sales" and in that folder are subfolders organized by store number. Inside those folders are the sales total files. The whole structure look like this...

```
ðŸ“‚ documents
    ðŸ“‚ letters
    ðŸ“‚ pictures
    ðŸ“„ image.png
    ðŸ“„ invoice.docx
```

To read through the contents of the folder, you can use the `readdir` method. Like most operations on the "fs" module, you use "readdir" both synchronously and asynchronously.

### Listing contents asynchronously

When you call an asynchronous method, it means Node.js isn't going to wait for the operation to complete before it moves to the next line of code. You'll need to provide a "callback" which will execute when the asynchronous process is finished.

The "readdir" returns a list of items

```javascript
fs.readdir("documents", (err, items) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  console.log(items); // [ image.png, invoice.docx, letters, pictures ]
});
```

Unless you specifically choose a sync operation on the "fs" module, the operation will be asynchronous.

### List contents synchronously

Synchronous methods cause Node.js to wait until the operation is finished before it moves to the next line.

```javascript
const items = fs.readdirSync("documents");
console.log(items); // [ image.png, invoice.docx, letters, pictures ]
```

Notice the order of the results returned by `readdir` and `readdirsync` methods: they are in alphabetical order.

## Determining content type

When you read the contents of a directory, you get back both folders and files as an array of strings. You can determine which ones are files vs which ones are directories by passing in the `withFileTypes` option. This will return an array of `Dirent` objects instead of an array of strings. The `Dirent` object has `isFile` and `isDirectory` methods that you can use to determine what type of object you are dealing with.

```javascript
const items = fs.readdirSync("documents", { withFileTypes: true });
items.forEach((item) => {
  const type = item.isDirectory() ? "folder" : "file";
  console.log(`${item.name}: ${type}`);
  // image.png: file, invoice.docx: file, letters: folder, pictures: folder
});
```

## A note about recursion

A common requirement is to have folder with subfolders which also have subfolders. Somewhere in this big tree of nested folders are the files that you need. You need a program that can walk that folder tree to find the files. To do that, you'll have to determine if an item is a folder, and then search that folder for files. You'll have to repeat this for every folder that you find.

You can do this by having a method that finds folders and then calls itself to find folders inside those folders. In this way, the program will "walk" the directory tree until it reads every folder inside, no matter where that folder is located. When a method calls itself, that's called "recursion".

```javascript
function findFiles(folderName) {
  const items = fs.readdirSync(folderName, { withFileTypes: true });
  items.forEach((item) => {
    if (item.isDirectory()) {
      // this is a folder, so call this method again and pass in
      // the path to the folder
      findFiles(`${folderName}/{item.name}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Found file: ${item.name} in folder: ${folderName}`);
    }
  });
}

findFiles("documents");
```

Recursion is a powerful feature of many programming languages, and one you will likely use a lot in the real world. Like in the next exercise!

In the next exercise, you'll use the "fs" module to dynamically read through Tailwind Traders main "stores" directory to find all of the "sales.json" files.
