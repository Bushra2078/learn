Now FashionFindr has a prototype that addresses your mission, your team wants to pitch that prototype to a potential investor. When you're pitching to a specific person or group of people, investors, potential new customers, a conference or event audience, you need to tailor your message to that audience. 

Every audience has a different focus, let's look at the two audiences you'll likely most frequently pitch to: investors and customers.

## Investors

Investors are focussed on your product, plans, and your potential to make money. They want to be sure the money they invest with you gives them a return.

Investors also want to know the mechanics of your business. You aren't just your product, you're also the go-to-market strategy that explains how you will acquire customers for your product and make money.

When pitching to investors it is crucial to research them and what they are interested in. For an investor, you would review their prior work history, their other investments, and their interests.

Pay special attention to those prior investments and their investment thesis. There are some important questions to answer, that might help understand if this investor is going to be interested in you?

* Have they invested in other companies like you? Is there overlap between your company and another investment? If there is, then you'll need to differentiate yourself from that other investment.
* Do they invest in companies in your industry?
* Do they invest in companies with your business model, for example some investors are only interested in software-as-service companies, or companies who are business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B).

You'll need the answers to these questions, and the insights into the investor, to either incorporate into your pitch or be ready to address them if the investor asks.

## Customers

Customers are focussed on your product and how it helps them. They want to ensure choosing your product is the right solution that will deliver them benefits like more sales, cost savings, productivity increases, or other benefits.

For FashionFindr, maybe you're pitching to a fashion or retail company to add their products to your app. The customer will want to understand:

* Why they benefit from being part of your ecosystem.
* How any integration will work, and most importantly,
* How much money they will get from the deal.

For customers, you need to understand their market, their current competitors, their business model and be able to articulate how you fit into their world.

## Connect with the audience

You'll need this information about your audience to both set the stage and to answer questions they will have for you. For FashionFindr, itâ€™ll also be key to find an entry point: a resonance that allows the investor to see the problem in light of their own experiences, empathize with the customer or engages their economic interests. This entry point enables us to share, to a more receptive audience, why our solution solves the problem.

## Ready them for your ask

Once they understand our solution, we can also explain our business model and highlight what our audience will get out of using, buying, or investing in our product. We'll see this in the next unit.
