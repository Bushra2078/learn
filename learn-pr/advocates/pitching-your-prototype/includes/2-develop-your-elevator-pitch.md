A pitch deck is the medium through which you share your prototype with investors, customers, or future employees. At the core of your pitch deck is the mission: the problem you're solving and your solution. You need to be able to articulate that mission quickly and concisely and leave a hook to engage whomever you are pitching. This is often described as your "elevator pitch": a pitch given in the time it takes you to ride an elevator.

> Hi, I'm Jane Smith, the CEO of FashionFindr. We've built a product which uses AI to identify fashion brands from photographs and makes it easier for you to find and buy the clothes you love. Our users convert 16x times more often than traditional sales techniques. We're seeking investment, and I'd love to demo our product for you.

A prototype pitch is an extension of your elevator pitch, with the bonus of having something to show your audience. You can turn your mission into some key opening slides for your pitch deck.

## What's the problem

State the problem you're trying to solve. This should be at the heart of your prototype. In our example, identifying a clothing item and brand from an image is hard. Our app makes it easier to identify who makes the clothes you want and links you to a way to buy them.

> [!NOTE]
> A quote or statistic that demonstrates the problem is often a useful addition.

## Here's the solution

Once you've articulated the problem, you need to share the solution you've built to solve the problem. This should include any competitive advantage your product brings to the market. In our case, FashionFindr uses machine learning and AI to enhance the search and buying experience for retail clothing.

## Why are we the right people

Lastly, we need to tell the audience why you and your team are the right people to solve this problem. This could be based on experience, specialized knowledge, or empathy for the customer. If you don't have related experience, then articulating prior success is a good substitute.
