Now FashionFindr has a prototype, your team wants to pitch that prototype to a potential investor. When you're pitching to a specific person or group of people, investors, potential new customers, a conference or event audience, you need to tailor your message to that audience. Research them and what they are interested in. For an investor, you would review their prior work history, their other investments, and their interests.

You'll need this information to set the stage. A good initial approach is to explain the scope or scale of the opportunity, your competition (if any), and the model with which you’re going to approach that opportunity.

For FashionFindr, it’ll be key to find an entry point: a resonance that allows the investor to see the problem in light of their own experiences, empathize with the customer or engages their economic interests. This entry point enables us to share, to a more receptive audience, why our solution solves the problem. 

Once they understand our solution, we can also explain our business model and highlight what our audience will get out of using, buying, or investing in our product.

This unit will teach FashionFindr about various audiences, tailor your pitch to that audience, connect with that audience, articulate the benefits of your prototype to an audience, and ready them for an ask.
