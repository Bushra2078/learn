The last component of a pitch is the ask. This might be a call to action to use the product, to buy it, or frequently, to raise money to develop the product further. For FashionFindr, they are seeking $2 million dollars in investment that they will use to further develop the prototype into a fully-fledged product.

In some regards, an ask is the easiest part of the pitch. You only need to articulate:

* What you want.
* What you are going to do with the results of an ask.

In FashionFindr's case they are looking for $2 million dollars in seed funding.

If you’re seeking large sums of investment capital (over $1M), most investors will want to know what your exit strategy is. Are you planning on getting acquired, going public (very few companies actually do), or something else? Show you’ve done some due diligence on this exit strategy, including the companies you’re targeting, and why it would make sense three, five, or 10 years down the road.
