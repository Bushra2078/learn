The last component of a pitch is the ask. This might be a call to action to use the product, to buy it, or frequently, to raise money to develop the product further. For FashionFindr, they are seeking $2 million dollars in investment that they will use to further develop the prototype into a fully-fledged product.

In some regards, an ask is the easiest part of the pitch. You only need to articulate:

* What you want.
* What you are going to do with the results of an ask.

In FashionFindr's case they are looking for $2 million dollars in seed funding.
