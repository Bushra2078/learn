In wrapping up our module on pitching a prototype, there are some broad tips that are also important to share.

Firstly, be passionate in your pitch. A sense of genuine enthusiasm and passion for your mission and your product will be apparent to your audience and sends the message that you're committed.

Secondly, think through what your audience might ask. Identify a "frequently asked questions" list of things you've been asked or expect to be asked. Have answers to those questions. Looking and acting like you have everything at your fingertips and are the subject matter expert will make you appear confident and help earn the respect of the audience.

Thirdly, be authentic and honest. If, you don't know the answer to a question or you get asked something you haven't prepared for, don't wing it. Instead, explain that you don't have the answer right now and that you'll get back to them. This is a far better approach than answering a question unprepared or disingenuously.

Lastly, practice does make perfect. Have your pitch down cold. Repetition will make you comfortable and appear confident. Pitching is a stressful process, knowing your material inside and out, is one way to reduce the overall stress of the situation.
