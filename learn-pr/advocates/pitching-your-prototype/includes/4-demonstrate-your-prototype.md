You’ve already gotten a story going in the FashionFindr pitch deck. Now you need to think about a demo. A demo should reflect the story you’re telling, with an emphasis on the solution your product provides. It should hit points of innovation, disruption, and differentiation in your product.

This unit will teach FashionFindr how to design and execute a compelling product demo.

•	Plan your demo.
•	Identify and articulate the highpoints of your prototype.
•	Explain missing features.
