You’ve already gotten a story going in the FashionFindr pitch deck. Now you need to think about a demo. A demo should be compelling and reflect the story you’re telling, with an emphasis on the solution your product provides. It should hit points of innovation, disruption, and differentiation in your product.

## Have a plan

Firstly, don't run through the prototype without a plan. You want to carefully map out each aspect of the prototype you want to demonstrate and ensure you have documented the perfect flow through it. For FashionFindr we might:

1. Launch the app.
2. Select an image to use as a search source.
3. Search the image and return the items of clothing in it.
4. Select an item and purchase it.

This shows the typical journey of a user through the product.

## What to show

You should ensure the demo shows the key user flows in your product. You need to coordinate what you demonstrate with the solution you've articulated to the problem. It should call out the unique features of your product or its differentiation from other products.

It's also important to think about a live demo versus a "canned demo". A "canned demo" is prerecorded or staged. If you're worried about the product crashing or failing then a "canned demo" is an option but remember it's not likely to inspire confidence in your audience. It's always best to show a normal user's experience.

## What's next

You should conclude your demonstration with a quick walk through of your product road map. This is especially true if your prototype lacks a key feature that represents product differentiation, for example if you haven't built it yet.
