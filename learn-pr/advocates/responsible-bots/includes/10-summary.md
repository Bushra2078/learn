In this module, we started to build a bot that can help school students with their geography lessons. Implementing a complete bot is out of scope for this module.

The main thing you learned in this module is how to create a responsible bot. 

A responsible bot:

- Introduces itself and makes it clear to the user that it is a bot.
- Speaks with the user in a natural language and tries to answer the user's questions.
- Welcomes and supports diverse users by adapting to communication styles and supporting different means of communication (including text and speech).

From a technological point of view, you learned how to:

- Use Azure Bot Service to create and host a chat bot in the Azure cloud.
- Develop a chat bot by using either the online editor that's available through the Azure portal or Visual Studio 2019.
- Use LUIS to enable language understanding through intent classification and entity extraction.
- Implement simple question answering and chit-chat functionality by using QnA Maker.
- Enhance bot interactions through visual cards, a meaningful welcome message, and help.

In the final unit, we outlined many possible improvements you can make to the bot to implement more responsible UI principles in a bot. We also provided links to resources that have more information. We hope the course has interested you in continuing to learn more, and to develop more responsible, personal, and enjoyable bots that will help people solve real-life problems!
