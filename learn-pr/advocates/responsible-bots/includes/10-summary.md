During this course, we have started to build a bot that helps school students with their Geography lessons. Implementing a complete bot is out of scope of this module.

The main thing you should have learnt during this module is how to create responsible bots. A responsible bot:

- Will introduce itself and make it clear that it is a bot
- Will speak with user in a natural language, trying to answer his questions
- Will welcome and support diverse users, by adapting to communication styles and supporting different means of communication (including text and speech)

From technological point of view, you have learnt:

- How to use Azure Bot Service to create and host a chat bot in the Azure Cloud
- How to develop chat bot using either Online Editor, or Visual Studio 2019
- How to use LUIS to enable language understanding through intent classification and entity extraction
- How to implement simple Question Answering and chit-chat functionality using QnA Maker
- How to enhance bot interactions through visual cards, meaningful welcome message and help.

In the last unit we have outlined many possible improvements to the bot that can be done to make it implement more responsible UI principles, and provided some links to resources with further information. I hope that this course has sparkled some interest to continue learning more, and developing more responsible, personal and enjoyable bots that will help people solve their real-life problems!
