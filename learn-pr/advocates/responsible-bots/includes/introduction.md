# Welcome to the course

In this course, we will learn about **responsible conversational AI**, and how to make bots that a user can trust and enjoy speaking to. We will cover the main principles, and then apply those principles to building simple **Educational Assistant for Geography** bot, which we call **GeoFriend**. It will help school children learning Geography answer some questions, and to study better.

# Prerequisites

During the course, we will be using [Azure Bot Service][BotService] and [C# Programming Language][CSharp] to build a bot. Thus, you will need the following:
* Basic knowledge of C#. You may want to [take this course][CSCourse] if you are not familiar with the language
* Azure Account. [This module][AzAccount] describes getting one.
* We suggest using [Visual Studio 2019][VS] as source code editor. Please, download and install Visual Studio on your computer, selecting "Azure Development". If your computer is not powerful enough, or you do not want to perform the installation - you should be able to use **Visual Studio Online**, though it is not recommended.
