The user interface (UI) between people and computers has evolved greatly over the years. From its humble beginning in paper-punch cards, UI design has progressed to command-line interfaces and windowed applications, to personalized phone apps and web sites. New concepts in UI design continue to make computers easier, more accessible, and more fun to use!

## Conversational UI

**Conversational UI** and **bots** are a new type of UX that has the potential to radically change how we use computers. You no longer need to know what buttons to press. In this new UX, we see the computer as an _assistant_ rather than as a _tool_. We want to speak to this assistant by using **natural language** in our own words.

With this UX transition, we need to take extra care to make sure users are comfortable having conversations with a computer. People can subconsciously expect a bot to act like a human. They might attribute emotions to the bot assistant, and in general, feel more personal involvement. So, we need to make sure we build conversational UI responsibly.

## Goal: Develop an educational assistant for geography

If you know the basics about software development, you have the power to make great things. For example, you can help schools transition to online learning by building them a more effective and engaging UI for their students. Bots are the UX revolution!

In this course, we'll develop a simple bot to help students learn geography. We'll call our bot **GeoFriend**. We won't cover how to create all of the functionality for the bot - just how to put the basic building blocks together. Later, you can expand on what you learned in this course to complete the bot project. You can also develop similar bots for other subject areas and different tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> As we mentioned, the bot interface is often more engaging for users because the bot seems to have a human-like personality. A bot helps users _feel_ like they're talking with another person, rather than giving instructions to a tool or computer. When human feelings are involved, frustrations can arise. To avoid frustrations and miscommunication, we need to build **responsible bots**. We'll talk about this issue in detail in a later unit.

## Learning objectives

- Learn the basic building blocks to create conversational UI for users
- Understand the principles to develop responsible bots
- Create a simple educational bot by using Azure Bot Services
- Improve upon your bot's ability to understand by adding LUIS
- Give your bot personality with Azure QnA Maker
- Explore how your bot can be more culturally sensitive

## Prerequisites

In this course, we'll use [Azure Bot Services][BotServices] and [C# programming language][CSharp] to build a bot.

Here's what you'll need to complete this course:

- Basic knowledge of C#. You might want to [take this course][CSCourse] if you're not familiar with the C# language.
- An Azure account. See [this module][AzAccount] to learn how to get an account. Try [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?azure-portal=true) for a free account if you are a current student!
- We recommend [Visual Studio 2019][VS] as a source code editor. You can download and install Visual Studio on your computer and select **Azure Development**. If necessary, you can use Visual Studio Online, but it's not recommended.
