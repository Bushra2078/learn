<!-- Add introduction statement - This is the intro to model it on:

Air pollution can be incredibly harmful to human and animal health, and is caused by a number of factors, both natural and artificial. Factory output, burning different types of fuel and natural wildfires all contribute to a rise in air pollution. This pollution is airborne, and won't stay where it was produced, but can be carried many kilometers across the globe by the wind. In late 2019, for example, the smoke from wildfires in Australia reached New Zealand, over 2,000 kilometers away.

The **user interface** (UI) between people and computers has evolved over the years. Starting with punch cards, UI changed to command-line interface and windowed applications, and more recently to phone applications and web sites. New UI designs helped make using computers easier and more accessible. However, regardless of the UI, people still thought of a computer as a **tool** that they needed to *learn how to use* to be productive.

## Conversational UI

A new kind of user experience is emerging -  **Conversational UI** and **bots**. These have the potential to change how we use computers. We no longer need to know what buttons to press. We can just ask a computer what we need and hope that it will understand us correctly and do the job. In this experience we see a computer as an **assistant** rather than a tool, and we want to be able to speak to it using **natural language**.

With this paradigm shift, we need to take extra care to make sure that users **are comfortable** having conversations with a computer. This is important because people can subconsciously expect a bot to act like a human. They might attribute some emotions to it, and in general feel more personal involvement. Thus, we need to make sure that we build conversational UI **responsibly**.

## Goal: Develop an educational assistant for geography

If you know some basics of software development, you have the power to make great things. For example, you could help schools transition to online learning by making a more effective and engaging UI for student. Bots can come to the rescue!

In this course, we'll start developing a simple bot which can help students learn geography. We'll call it **GeoFriend**. We won't walk you through the creation of a bot with all the functionality, but you'll learn how to put basic building blocks together. You can later expand on that knowledge to complete this project, develop similar bots for different subject areas, or even for different tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> Bot interface is typically more engaging for the user, because they often attribute a human-like personality to the bot. This can also lead to some frustrations. To avoid these frustrations, we need to build **responsible bots**.

## Learning objectives
<!-- Add more objectives to this list -->

- Learn basic principles to develop responsible conversational experiences for users
- Develop a simple educational assistant with Azure Bot Service and Azure Cognitive Services

## Prerequisites

In this course, we'll be using the [Azure Bot Service][BotService] and [C# Programming Language][CSharp] to build a bot.

Here's what you'll need to complete this course:

- Basic knowledge of C#. You may want to [take this course][CSCourse] if you're not familiar with the language.
- An Azure account. [This module][AzAccount] describes how to get an account.
- We recommend [Visual Studio 2019][VS] as source code editor. You can download and install Visual Studio on your computer and select "Azure Development". If necessary, you can also opt to use **Visual Studio Online**, but we don't recommend it.
