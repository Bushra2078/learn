Bots have changed the way that companies conduct business. Instead of assigning repetitive tasks to employees, businesses can develop bots to handle tedious work. These computer programs complete low-level administrative and support jobs. They also imitate human user behavior.

Some bots work behind the scenes to make systems efficient and secure. Other bots interact with customers. These bots use AI to learn from their interactions with people. Their goal isn't just to collect information from customers. They also use machine learning to engage in realistic conversations.

Along with this advanced functionality comes more responsibility. When bots act like humans, emotions can enter the equation. People feel more personal involvement when they chat with a bot than when they complete an online form. As developers, we need to design bots to conduct themselves professionally. To provide good customer service, our bots need to treat people fairly and respectfully.

## Goal: Develop an educational assistant for geography

If you know the basics about software development, you have the power to make great things. For example, you can help schools transition to online learning by building them a more effective and engaging UI for their students. Bots are the UX revolution!

In this course, we'll develop a basic bot to help students learn geography. We'll call our bot **GeoFriend**. We won't cover how to create all the functionality for the botâ€”just how to put the basic building blocks together. We'll also add features to help our bot interact responsibly with students. Later, you can expand on what you learned in this course to complete the bot project. You can also develop similar bots for other subject areas and different tasks.

## Learning objectives

- Learn about the basic building blocks for creating conversational AI for users.
- Create a basic educational bot from a template.
- Apply principles of responsible AI to your bot.
- Test your bot locally in an environment that simulates a web chat UI.

## Prerequisites

In this course, we'll use a template, the C# programming language, and the .NET platform to build a bot.

Here's what you'll need to complete this course:

- Basic knowledge of C#. You might want to [take this course][CSCourse] if you're not familiar with the C# language.
- [ASP.NET Core Runtime 3.1][Download .NET]
