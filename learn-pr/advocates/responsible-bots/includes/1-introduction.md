The **user interface** (UI) between people and computers has evolved over the years. Starting with punch cards, UI changed to command-line interface and windowed applications, and more recently to phone applications and web sites. New UI designs helped make using computers easier and more accessible. However, regardless of the UI, people still thought of a computer as a **tool** that they needed to *learn how to use* to be productive.

## Conversational UI

Things now may change with the emergence of new type of user experience - **Conversational UI** and **bots**. Instead of knowing which buttons to press, we may just ask a computer what we need, hoping that it will understand us correctly and do the job. In this experience we regard a computer as an **assistant** rather than a tool, and we want to be able to speak to it naturally using **natural language**.

With this paradigm shift, we need to take extra care to make sure that users **are comfortable** when dealing with a computer through conversations. This is important, because people can subconsciously expect a bot to act like a human, for example, attribute some emotions to it, and in general feel more personal involvement. Thus, we need to make sure that we build conversational UI **responsibly**.

## Our Goal: Develop an educational assistant for geography

If you come to this course, you probably know some basics of software development. Being able to program, you have a great power to make great things! Suppose, you want to help schools transition to online learning and make it more effective and engaging. Bots can come to the rescue!

In this course, we will start developing a simple bot which can help  school students learn Geography. We will call it **GeoFriend**. While I will not walk you through developing the complete functionality, I will teach you how to put basic building blocks together. You can later expand on that knowledge to complete this project, or develop similar bots for different subject areas and even for different tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> Bot interface is typically more engaging for the user, because he/she often attributes human-like personality to the bot. This can also lead to some frustrations. To avoid that, we need to build **responsible bots**.

## Learning objectives
<!-- Add more objectives to this list -->

- Learn basic principles to develop responsible conversational experiences for users
- Develop a simple educational assistant with Azure Bot Service and Azure Cognitive Services

## Prerequisites

In this course, we'll be using the [Azure Bot Service][BotService] and [C# Programming Language][CSharp] to build a bot.

Here's what you'll need to complete this course:

- Basic knowledge of C#. You may want to [take this course][CSCourse] if you're not familiar with the language.
- An Azure account. [This module][AzAccount] describes how to get an account.
- We suggest using [Visual Studio 2019][VS] as source code editor. Please, download and install Visual Studio on your computer, selecting "Azure Development". If your computer is not powerful enough, or you do not want to perform the installation - you should be able to use **Visual Studio Online**, though it is not recommended.
