<!-- Add introduction statement - This is the intro to model it on:

Air pollution can be incredibly harmful to human and animal health, and is caused by a number of factors, both natural and artificial. Factory output, burning different types of fuel and natural wildfires all contribute to a rise in air pollution. This pollution is airborne, and won't stay where it was produced, but can be carried many kilometers across the globe by the wind. In late 2019, for example, the smoke from wildfires in Australia reached New Zealand, over 2,000 kilometers away.

The user interface (UI) between people and computers has evolved greatly over the years. From its humble beginning in paper-punch cards, UI design has progressed to command-line interfaces and windowed applications, to personalized phone apps and web sites. New concepts in UI design continue to make computers easier, more accessible, and more fun to use! But in spite of UI improvements, many people still think of a computer as a _tool_ they need to _learn how to use_ to be productive. There's an emerging type of user experience (UX) that's helping to solve this problem. 

## Conversational UI

**Conversational UI** and **bots** is a new type of UX that has the potential to radically change how we use computers. You no longer need to know what buttons to press. You just ask the computer for what you need, and hope it will understand you correctly and do the job. In this new UX, we see the computer as an _assistant_ rather than as a _tool_. We want to speak to this assistant by using **natural language** in our own words.

With this UX transition, we need to take extra care to make sure users are comfortable having conversations with a computer. People can subconsciously expect a bot to act like a human. They might attribute emotions to the bot assistant, and in general, feel more personal involvement. So, we need to make sure we build conversational UI responsibly.

## Goal: Develop an educational assistant for geography

If you know the basics about software development, you have the power to make great things. For example, you can help schools transition to online learning by building them a more effective and engaging UI for their students. Bots are the UX revolution!

In this course, we'll develop a simple bot to help students learn geography. We'll call our bot **GeoFriend**. We won't cover how to create all of the functionality for the bot--just how to put the basic building blocks together. Later, you can expand on what you learned in this course to complete the bot project. You can also develop similar bots for other subject areas and different tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> As we mentioned, the bot interface is often more engaging for users because the bot seems to have a human-like personality. A bot helps users _feel_ like they're talking with another person, rather than giving instructions to a tool or computer. When human feelings are involved, frustrations can arise. To avoid frustrations and miscommunication, we need to build **responsible bots**. We'll talk about this issue in detail in a later unit.

## Learning objectives
<!-- Add more objectives to this list -->

- Learn the basic building blocks to create conversational UI for users
- Understand the principles to develop responsible bots
- Develop an educational assistant with Azure Bot Service and Azure Cognitive Services

## Prerequisites

In this course, we'll use the [Azure Bot Service][BotService] and [C# programming language][CSharp] to build a bot.

Here's what you'll need to complete this course:

- Basic knowledge of C#. You might want to [take this course][CSCourse] if you're not familiar with the C# language.
- An Azure account. See [this module][AzAccount] to learn how to get an account.
- We recommend [Visual Studio 2019][VS] as a source code editor. You can download and install Visual Studio on your computer and select **Azure Development**. If necessary, you can use Visual Studio Online, but it's not recommended.
