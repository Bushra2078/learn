In this course, we started to build a bot that can help school students with their geography lessons. Implementing a complete bot is out of scope for this module.

From a technological point of view, you learned how to:

- Use a template to create a local bot in the [C# programming language][CSharp].
- Develop a chat bot by using Visual Studio.
- Add a data source with country/region information to implement a dictionary of capital/major cities.
- Enhance bot interactions through a meaningful welcome message.
- Engage in a chat session by using Bot Framework Emulator.

We also looked at [guidelines for conversational AI][Microsoft guidelines for conversational AI]. Through those principles, we learned several ways to improve a bot by making it responsible:

- Programming it to state its purpose and make it clear that it's a bot
- Designing it to support diverse users and treat people fairly
- Making it sensitive to cultural norms

Remember, [Microsoft Bot Framework][Bot Framework] is just a tool to make bot development easy. It's up to you and other developers to make bots responsible.

As we've seen, bots can handle tedious tasks. People then have more time to engage in creative, problem-solving work. Bots also save you time and money by efficiently completing repetitive tasks in a consistent way.

This course has provided you with the basic tools and experience you need for bot development. We hope it equips you to build useful, responsible bots that benefit your users and your organization.
