  questions:
  - content: "What are some characteristics of a responsible bot?"
    choices:
    - content: "The bot is sensitive to cultural differences."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A responsible bot acts respectfully. It doesn't offend users by conflicting with their values and cultural norms."
    - content: "The bot apologizes when it doesn't understand an issue or can't solve a problem."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Giving an apology might be a good idea. But a better approach is to hand off the conversation to a human when the situation becomes too complex for the bot to handle."
    - content: "The bot imitates human behavior as closely as possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A responsible bot tells users that it's a bot and not a person. The bot makes its abilities and limitations clear. Then users are less disappointed when they have problems with the bot."

  - content: "What tool can you use to develop a bot?"
    choices:
    - content: "Bot Framework Emulator."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Bot Framework Emulator provides a way to test and debug bots. You can use this tool to inspect the messages that your bot sends and receives, but not to develop your bot."
    - content: "Visual Studio."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can develop bot code with the Visual Studio IDE on your local machine."
    - content: "The Azure CLI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure CLI primarily provides an interface to Azure resources. You can use this tool to connect to Azure and run commands on your resources."

  - content: "In the bot code, there's a file called `EchoBot.cs`. What does the `OnMessageActivityAsync` function in that file do?"
    choices:
    - content: "When a new user enters the chat, this function is called. It sends a welcome message to the user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A different function in `EchoBot.cs`, the `OnMembersAddedAsync` function, is the function that's called when a new user enters the chat."
    - content: "The `OnMessageActivityAsync` function is the primary function in a bot's code. This function is called each time the bot receives a message from a user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The code in this function determines, at a high level, how a bot reacts when it receives a message from a user."
    - content: "This function monitors the chat session. It watches for messages that are out of sync and reorders them so the conversation appears in chronological order on the user's screen."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `OnMessageActivityAsync` function is called each time a bot receives a message from the user. It determines, at a high level, how the bot reacts to the message."

  - content: "Suppose you're creating a bot to help school students learn a foreign language. When a user enters an English word or phrase, the bot should provide a translation into that language. How should your bot react when a user enters a coarse term?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provide a translation of the word. Bots should always strive to help users solve problems. Since obscenities are a common part of language, it's most helpful to users to learn them."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your bot should respect cultural norms. Because school students use your bot, it should avoid offending or upsetting anyone. It shouldn't translate coarse terms."
    - content: "Hand the conversation off to a human operator. Because students use the bot, it should sidestep the problem to avoid offending or upsetting anyone."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Handing off to a human operator is appropriate when the bot enters a situation that's too complex for the bot to handle. In this case, intervention would be inefficient. The bot is capable of identifying the term and determining that the bot shouldn't provide a translation."
    - content: "Don't translate the term. Make it clear in the bot's initial conversations what types of words and phrases the bot translates."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A bot should make its purpose and limitations clear at the beginning of the conversation."
