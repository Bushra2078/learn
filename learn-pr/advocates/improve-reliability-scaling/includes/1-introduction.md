The Dickerson hierarchy of reliability has served as the roadmap for this
learning path. Over the course of previous five modules, we have come
up through the levels from the foundational step of monitoring to incident
response, post-incident review, and testing/release.

In this final module, you will complete your journey at the capacity/scale
level, by learning how to handle the threat to reliability that comes with
growth, and ensure that your solutions can scale.

When you have completed this module, you will:

-   Learn about scalability and the scalability/reliability relationship
-   Understand the role of capacity planning in preparing for growth
-   Learn basic concepts and fundamental terms related to scaling
-   Eliminate single points of failure
-   Understand the different kinds of growth and how to respond to them
-   Be able to measure capacity in the cloud
-   Catch issues with service limits and quotas before they emerge using
    Azure tools
-   Understand important steps to take before beginning work on scaling
-   List techniques for making an application more scalable including
    decoupling, queues, in-memory caching and database sharding
-   Learn about the Azure tools that make it possible to take your
    application or service global
