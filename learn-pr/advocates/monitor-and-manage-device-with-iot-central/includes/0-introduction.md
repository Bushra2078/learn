Azure IoT Central is a fully managed Internet of Things (IoT) solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage your global IoT assets.

In this module, you'll follow a scenario in which a remote coffee machine is connected to Azure IoT Central for monitoring and management of issues. You can monitor telemetry such as water temperature and humidity, observe the state of your machine, set optimal temperature, receive warranty status, and send commands. If the warranty is expired when the water temperature is outside the expected range, an email from IoT Central is sent to the client's maintenance department for further action.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Create an Azure IoT Central custom application
- Create and define your device template
- Connect a coffee machine simulator to your application in Azure IoT Central
- Validate your connection and data flow
- Configure rules for maintenance notifications
