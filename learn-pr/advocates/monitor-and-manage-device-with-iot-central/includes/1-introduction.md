Azure IoT Central is an IoT [application platform as a service (aPaaS)](/azure/iot-fundamentals/iot-solution-apaas-paas) that reduces the burden and cost of developing, managing, and maintaining enterprise-grade IoT solutions

Suppose you work at a coffee machine company as the IT expert. Your company will launch IoT enabled coffee machines and wants to monitor and manage issues remotely. If the warranty is expired when the water temperature is outside the expected range, client's maintenance department needs to be notified for further action. You need a solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor and manage your coffee machines spread around the world.

In this module, you'll connect a coffee machine simulator to Azure IoT Central for monitoring telemetry such as water temperature and humidity, observe the state of your machine, set optimal temperature, receive warranty status, and send commands. You'll then configure rules to send maintenance notifications when the warranty is expired and water temperature is outside the expected range.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Create an Azure IoT Central custom application
- Create and define your device template
- Connect a coffee machine simulator to your application in Azure IoT Central
- Validate your connection and data flow
- Configure rules for maintenance notifications

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with core Internet of Things (IoT) concepts such as devices, sensors and gateways.
