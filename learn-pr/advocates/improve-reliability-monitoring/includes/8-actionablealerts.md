In this module so far, we've explored ways to think about, measure and
interact with the reliability of our systems. But there's also a way where
that reliability interacts with _us_: alerts. It is easy to set up Azure
Monitor and other tools to send you alerts based on various metrics and
signals including the SLIs and SLOs we've seen before. Azure also has the
ability to send alerts based on service issues through the
[Azure Service health](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health/)
feature.

With the power easily sending out alerts brings there comes a potential
peril. And that's where the word _sustainably_ comes into the picture in
the SRE definition we've seen before:

> Site Reliability Engineering is an engineering discipline devoted to
> helping organizations sustainably achieve the appropriate level of
> reliability in their systems, services, and products.

Alerts are designed to notify you when there is a problem with your
systems. However, when alerts are improperly configured, this can undermine
your goal of creating a sustainable operations practice. It is possible to
derail all the effort you have put into bringing SLIs and SLOs into your
organization if it translates into a hailstorm of alerts for your
personnel. "Alert fatigue" is a well know ailment in the operations
community. This unit aims to help you prevent it from occurring in your
organization.

A key contributor to alert fatigue are alerts that aren't actionable. Let's
see how to avoid creating them.

## What alerts are -- and aren’t

To understand why bad alerting can create a problem, you need to think
about the purpose of alerts and how they differ from other operational
signals.

Actionable alerts are _not_:

-   **Logs.** Alerts are not records of events; that’s the role of logs. If
    you are just trying to record that an event happened, write it to a log
    file, not a pager.

-   **Notifications.** Alerts are not intended to announce non-critical
    occurrences such as the completion of a software build. You shouldn't
    have to interrupt someone, breaking their concentration and focus, just
    to deliver a piece of news.

-   **Heartbeats.** Alerts shouldn’t be used as a reminder that your system
    is still running. We have seen situations where people say "Oh, if I
    don't get at least one page from that system every hour, I know
    something is wrong and I have go deal with it." This is a terrible
    idea.

Actionable alerts are used for situations in which you need a human to
investigate and intervene to remediate the problem. Alerts should be
communications that something exceptional or unexpected has happened
requiring someone’s attention.

If the event is something that the system can handle through automated
processes, such as scaling resources within a preset limit, an alert is not
necessary. The system should just handle it and write a line to a log. It
shouldn't page you are 2am to tell you that there was a situation it
successfully handled.

## Create actionable alerts

In order for an alert to be actionable, it has to have:

-   Simplicity -- you don't want to make an alert that requires the
    recipient to have to puzzle over it before they know what to do. If the
    alert is too complex, the poor person who has just been woken yo up in
    the middle of the night is going to lose valuable time just trying to
    figure out what it means.

-   Scope -- one of the first things a person receiving the message will
    have to do in order to be able to triage it effectively is determine
    the scope of the problem. Is the issue with a single server? one
    service? a whole region? world wide? Make it easier for the recipient,
    put this information in the alert.

-   Context -- what does the person who is going to receive that alert need
    to know to get started dealing with it? Let's dive further into this
    part.

### Providing context in the alert

Let’s look at some elements that an actionable alert should always include
so the recipients have the context they need:

-   **Where is the alert coming from?** Many organizations have multiple
    monitoring systems in use at any one time and a large number of
    interconnected systems. It can save someone a tremendous amount of time
    if the alert says "This alert for payroll system THX-1138 is coming
    from Azure monitor subscription 'prod'".

-   **What expectation was violated?** An alert that just describes the
    current state of affairs is not nearly as helpful as it could be.
    Compare "The database server is running at 80% load." to "The database
    server has been running at 80% load for the last two hours when it
    should be running at 60% load or lower."

-   **Why is this an issue (for the customer)?** information about the
    effect or impact the situation has had or potentially will have gives
    us a way to determine importance and to appropriately gauge our
    reaction.

-   **What are the next steps to take?** if possible, the alert should
    include what the person responding should do next, even if that is a
    pointer to a troubleshooting guide or some other documentation to find
    help in diagnosing and remediating this problem.

Including such helpful context and working to make your alerts actionable
can make operations practices more sustainable and make responding to
those alerts easier.
