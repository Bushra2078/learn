In this module, we've explored the subject of monitoring as the foundation
of a larger framework for improving reliability. You now have:

The expanded understanding of reliability we've discussed and the framing
provided for it will allow us to use the tools provided by Azure to:

-   gain operational awareness
-   reason about an appropriate level of reliability for our systems,
    services and products
-   construct a process for monitoring this reliability using SLIs and SLOs
-   have concrete discussion about reliability using objective data
-   create actionable alerts that support a sustainable operations practice

Together, these will help you to create and nurture feedback loops within
your organization that can lead to improved reliability.
