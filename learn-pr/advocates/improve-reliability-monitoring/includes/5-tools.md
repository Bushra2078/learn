Now that we have a deeper understanding of reliability and some useful
framing for how to view it for monitoring, it is time to get practical.
This unit will introduce us to a product suite in Azure and a specific tool
in that suite that will allow us to put this information to direct use.

## Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive platform for monitoring Azure resources to
gain insights into your applications, infrastructure, and network. In this
module, the focus will be on the Azure Monitor tools that you can use to
monitor and improve your reliability.

### Data sources

A look at Azure Monitor starts with the data that comes into the system.
Azure Monitor takes in data from a number of different sources. These
include:

-   Data from applications.
-   Data from the various operating systems running in Azure.
-   Information fed from Azure resources, subscriptions, and tenants.
-   Custom data. If youâ€™d like to send in monitoring-related data from your
    systems or applications, basically of any sort and from any source,
    Azure Monitor can take it that custom data.

### Data types

The data that comes into Azure Monitor can be divided into two types:

-   **Metrics**: Small numerical pieces of information from counters,
    gauges, and so forth that are collected on a regular basis.

-   **Log data**: Information gathered from many different logs such as
    Windows event logs, Linux syslog, agents running on virtual machines,
    custom logs, telemetry from Application Insights, and more.

In this module, we will be focusing primarily on log data.

### Do something with the data

Once the data is in Azure Monitor, there is a whole suite of tools that
will let us analyze, visualize, respond to specific contents and integrate
that data with other tools.

In our next unit, we're going to explore in more detail one of the most
useful tools for working with reliability - Log Analytics.
