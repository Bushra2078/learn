As we start to pay attention to the reliability of our services, we will
need a way to track how well (or not well) they are doing. Often this
information can be found in the logs for a service so we're going to need a
tool to work with those logs. Log Analytics will be the tool we'll be using
in Azure for this purpose. It will allow us to query this data and display
it in ways that will be useful to our reliability work.

The query process for log analytics involves writing queries in the Kusto
Query Language (KQL). If you have ever worked with any other query language
(for example, Structured Query Language, which most people know by its
acronym, SQL) you will have no problem picking up KQL. And even if you
haven't, once you see how it works, basic KQL queries will likely come
pretty easy to you.

## How Log Analytics works

So let's see how this is all going to work. Here's a diagram about how Log
Analytics works:

Data for Log Analytics comes in from a number of sources including:

- Windows event logs
- syslog on Linux machines
- agents running on VMs
- custom logs people choose to send in
- metrics from Azure resources
- telemetry info coming in from Application Insights

All of this information comes into what Log Analytics calls "tables". You
can think of each table as a separate database. You will be writing queries
to pull the information from the tables. For the examples we will be
showing later in this module, we'll be working primarily with a table
called "requests."

## Log Analytics interface

The graphic below shows the different parts of the Log Analytics interface.

On the left is a section of the screen that makes sure you never get lost
when using Log Analytics. It shows the tables you are potentially working
with, and if you expand a section, you’ll see a listing of the fields in
that table that are available to query. If you click on any of the fields
or the table name, it will be copied into the query construction area.

The query construction area is at the top. This is where you specify a
query and run it. You can provide a timeframe for the data if it isn’t
already specified as part of the query. You can save queries or open up
additional tabs if you want to work on several queries at a time.

At the bottom of the page is more useful information. Here Log Analytics
will show you previous queries you ran, which can be helpful if you need to
return to something you’ve already specified previously – for example, if
you were working on a query, tried something, and had to backtrack. 

## Writing KQL queries

KQL is a powerful query language. We're only going to scratch the surface
with some basic queries so you can see how easy it is to use. Later on, if
you'd like to dive deeper to use some of the more advanced features
(including some machine learning functionality), be sure to check out the
[Log Analytics tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal).

Let's start by writing a simple KQL query. Almost all KQL queries begin
with the data source - the table you are querying. So, if we were querying
data from a "requests" table, we'd start with this in the query area:

`Requests`

The next part of a KQL query is to connect the table with the operation you
want to perform. Use a pipe character (the horizontal bar on the keyboard
most commonly found above the slash key) between the table name and the
command.

Here's a simple query to sort the table return the top 10 records found:

```kusto
Requests
|top 10
```

Here are some examples of other common commands you might use instead of
"top 10:"

-   If you want to see any random 10 records instead of the top 10 (for
    example, to see the table structure), you can use the command:

    ```kusto
    requests
    |take 10
    ```

-   To see records that have come in during the last half hour, you can use
    the following query:

    ```kusto
    requests
    |where timestamp > ago(30m)
    ```

-   Another common task is to specify the order in which the data is to be
    returned. Here is an example of a query that sorts by a specific field
    (timestamp) in descending order (for example, most recent data first):

    ```kusto
    requests
    |sort by timestamp desc
    ```

As with SQL, you can set multiple conditions to specify which records you
want returned. Use additional pipe characters and clauses to add them. The
pipe character separates commands so the output of the first one will be
the input of the next command. A single query can have any number of
commands.

Here is an example of a query that returns all of the 404 response code
records (for example, all of the “page not found” records from a web service) in
the last 30 minutes:

```kusto
requests
|where timestamp > ago(30m)
|where toint(resultCode) == 404
```

This query is written to maximize efficiency. By first selecting only the
records from the last 30 minutes, you drastically reduce the number of
records that the second clause has to scan through. If you wrote this query
in the opposite order, first it would find all of the 404s from the
beginning of time in the data and then discard the vast majority to give us
only the last half an hour’s worth. Always consider the order of processing
when you write queries with multiple conditions.

One last query example before we return to the power of Log Analytics later
in this module to help improve our reliability. Here's a query that shows a
calculation based on the data:

```kusto
requests
|where timestamp > ago(30m)
|summarize count() by name, URL
```

This query returns a summary of the requests we received in the last half
hour. So on a web service, it might tell us that there has been a
`GET index.html` request to the URL
[http://tailwindtraders.com](http://tailwindtraders.com) 2,875 times. We
are pausing our look at KQL with this query because it will nicely connect
to the KQL queries we will use in the next unit.
