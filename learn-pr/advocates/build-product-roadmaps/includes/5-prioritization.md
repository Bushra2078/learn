As we mentioned earlier, one of the critical differences between a backlog and a product road map is prioritization. You’re never going to have the resources to work on every aspect of your product at once, so you need to prioritize the work. There are [numerous approaches to prioritization](https://blog.airtable.com/3-ways-to-prioritize-your-product-roadmap-with-a-matrix/).

If your ideas are starting to pile up, this is an excellent opportunity to leverage a prioritization framework, such as [the Lean Startup’s 2×2 grids](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/07/enter-matrix-lean-prioritisation/) or [weighted scoring models](https://280group.com/product-management-blog/product-roadmap-prioritization-weighted-scoring-kano-model/) to eliminate low impact ideas further.

What we’ve discovered in working with teams though, is that nothing deflates morale more than a seemingly arbitrary process of prioritization, this doesn’t foster good team relations and productivity. So, pick an approach, establish and agree to it with your team, and be transparent about the process, especially any exceptions you make to the process like "the CEO says we should build..."!

In this unit, the student will learn about various prioritization frameworks and help understand what framework might work for them.
