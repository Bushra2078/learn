The product road map is the strategic guide to building your product. Every road map should be driven by the mission of your product:

* Why are you making this product?

If you can’t answer these questions or haven’t yet done so, then you need to rethink building a road map or developing the product in the first place!

## Why are you making this product

At the core of your product road map is the mission: why you're making this product. This is often articulated as your "elevator pitch": a pitch given in the time it takes you to ride an elevator.

> Hi, I'm Jane Smith, the CEO of FashionFindr. Last year, I went to a friend's wedding, and I was really taken with one of my fellow guest's outfit. I forgot to ask her where she got the outfit at the wedding, but when I got home, I realized I had a photo of the outfit. I tried to use the picture to find the outfit but found the experience frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful. That inspired me to build FashionFindr, an app which uses machine learning and AI to identify fashion brands from photographs and makes it easier for you to find and buy the clothes you love.

Everyone in your Product, Design, and Engineering teams should be able to give the product’s "elevator pitch" and understand and absorb the why of the product.

The mission provides those teams with a reference point to validate the work they are doing is the right work and that it is adding value to the product. Both are key drivers for engineer happiness. If you can’t connect work to the mission (or engineering tooling that accelerates your development) in some way, then it’s probably a good indication that it is work you should not be doing.
