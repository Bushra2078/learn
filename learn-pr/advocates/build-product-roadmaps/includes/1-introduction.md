You have an amazing idea. You’ve taken the core concepts of your idea and turned them into a prototype, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The prototype is the first pass. It’s not pretty, nor complete, and often not tested. Frank Robinson said when he coined the MVP term:

> ... think big for the long term but small for the short term. Think big enough that the first product is a sound launching pad for it and its next generation and the road map that follows, but not so small that you leave room for a competitor to get the jump on you.

Once you have your prototype and you know that it’s viable, how do you turn it into a fully-fledged product and how do you get there? Enter the product road map.

This module is an introduction to product road maps and presents a high-level structure for road maps and a process for how to build them. We assume you're using an Agile (or Agile-ish) methodology, but we're not strongly opinionated about what sort of Agile you embrace. This isn’t a definitive guide to product road maps but a starting point from which to get started, experiment, and learn what works for you.

You’ll learn how to:

* Describe the basic components and importance of product road maps.
* Identify your product mission.
* Identify the appropriate audience(s) for your road map
* Define a prioritization methodology for your development.
* Structure a road map appropriate for your product.
* Identify and develop themes, milestones, epics, and user stories.

By the end of this module you’ll be able to construct a product road that your team can use to build and manage your product.
