In addition to knowing who you are building your product for, you should know who you are building your road map for. Every audience of a road map will have different expectations. Since your road map can’t be all things to all people, you’ll need to consider different formats or documents for these different audiences.

* Investors generally want a high-level presentation with quarterly milestones.

* Your executive team are in your high-level goals and the total time and cost of development work and how it achieves the company's strategic objectives.

* Customers (and your Sales and Marketing team) want to see what features you’re adding that will give customers more capabilities or make the product easier to use.

But your most important audience is your product, design, and engineering teams. They are looking for lower-level tactical information, sprint and story-level, that will tell them what to work on right now.

## 
The diversity of potential audiences and the level of tactical detail requires a single source of truth for your road map. If suddenly you have data in multiple places, then you need to update them all when something changes. 

This is where an off-the-shelf road map tool starts to come in handy. There is a wide selection of potential tools ranging from add-ons or extensions to common ticketing frameworks like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), GTD planning tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Asana](https://asana.com/), or specifically product-centric road map tools like [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/). These tools allow you to have a single source of truth and output the data in a variety of forms, suitable for varying audiences.

If you don’t already have a tool, then we recommend you try a few to find one that suits your team. And, don’t forget to consider some growth: will it still work for your team in 6-12-18 months?
