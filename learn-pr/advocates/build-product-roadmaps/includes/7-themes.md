Once we have our features prioritized, we can group them into themes. Themes are the present articulation of some aspect of the overall mission. You break down the journey to mission success into the current themes you need to focus on to continue that journey. A theme might be: "Acquire more customers!", "Reduce customer churn" or "Increase stability of notifications." They could also reflect internal priorities: "Streamline deployment!" or "Reduce test suite run time."

Themes provide the glue between the mission and the tactical work to be done to execute on the mission.

A good theme can be clearly traced back to the mission but also has direct and immediate outcomes and measures. Themes should be tied to measures and metrics that demonstrate the impact of features within the theme, for example, if the theme is to acquire new customers, then the measure might be a customer acquisition target.

Themes are also an excellent way to communicate progress to stakeholders:

> This quarter we’re going to focus on reducing customer churn by 20% by working on the look and feel of the UI, adding a recommendation engine, and the reporting capabilities of the product.

A theme, or a variant of a theme, will likely be repeated throughout a product’s lifespan, so it’s important to be as explicit as possible about the theme and what it achieves in this particular incarnation. This explication also ensures you keep your theme focused and you make it achievable.

Themes are often applied to epics and stories as tags. This capability is also a bonus of a product management tool, they allow you to define collections of elements that make reporting and tracking easier.
