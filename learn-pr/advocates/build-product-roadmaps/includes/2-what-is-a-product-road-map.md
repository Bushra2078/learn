A product road map is a plan for your product. It's a strategic document that helps you plan for your product, its growth, and keeps your team on track in executing on that growth. It is what allows your Product organization, and your Product Managers, to know and report where you are, where you’re going, and what the steps are along the path.

A good road map is the "north star" for your product. It connects the long-term vision your organization has for the product with the operational and customer reality on the ground. From your road map, your Product and Engineering teams derive the list of work that they'll undertake and populate backlogs.

A road map is a living document. Its development is iterative and organic. It changes as priorities and focuses change, as the product grows, you learn what product market fit looks like, and you learn from your customers. A real product road map is never finished.

Backlogs, the collections of stories, bugs, ideas, and cocktail napkins of genius, are not road maps. A backlog is a pile of work: imagine the pile of clothes dumped on the bed before Marie Kondo organizes them. You might draw items from your backlog for the road map, but they’ll need to go through a process of analysis and prioritization before being added.

How often you update your road map usually depends on how mature your organization is, early-stage startups probably have road maps that range out 3 to 6 months and are updated monthly. A larger or more mature organization might plan quarterly with some, less stable, future plans laid out for coming quarters.

A great product road map is a collaboration between many partners across your organization. Owned and collated by your Product team, it draws on inputs from internal groups like Engineering, Support, Marketing, and Sales. It is also driven by external data collected from your product, your customers, your competitors, your investors, and the market.

A good Product Manager is constantly gathering this data, validating, and feeding into the road map, and seeing how, or if, it impacts plans. The Product Manager is also feeding in the outcomes of the ongoing work you’re doing, whether the features you have build had an impact on metrics like user adoption, customer satisfaction, or whatever else drives your business.

The outcomes from our road map then become part of the inputs, together with the continuous data gathered from the other sources, and combines to form an iterative, cyclical, document.

A product road map is hard to make. It’s a balancing act of finding the right features to build, evaluating customer asks versus product goals (like avoiding being captured in the orbit of a single large customer!) and then applying the engineering and design resources you have available to you.

To build a road map we work top down; from the least granular component to the most granular.

* Mission: your reason for building the product.
* Themes: high-level components of the product, for example, "Acquire new customers."
* Milestones: groups of epics, time-boxed, for example, three months worth of work.
* Epics: collections of user stories that often represent a feature, for example, Authentication.
* User Stories: user-centric stories that describe a requirement. Usually collected in an epic.

We always recommend this approach because the top-level components are closer to the mission and should be a logical progression of detail, easily rolled up and tied to that mission. The alternative, starting from the base and writing up a series of user stories, leaves a lot of space between your mission and its practical application. We find if you start with that base you end up twisting the top-level components into the shape of the user stories and not vice-versa.
