Contained inside of your themes are epics. Epics are collections of stories, aligned with a feature of some kind. Earlier in the post, we talked about a theme of "reducing customer churn" and how it included working on look and feel, a recommendation engine, and the reporting interface. Each of these items can be broadly considered features. So our recommendation engine feature would be described as an epic. To build that engine you might have an epic called "Recommendation Engine," perhaps containing user stories for:

* The back-end engine.
* A data pipeline.
* The recommendation algorithm.
* The recommendations interface.

Each epic should have a description and measures of success. For our recommendation engine, this description and measure might be:

> An engine that returns product recommendations based on customer’s prior purchases. The recommendation engine must return the customer a minimum of 3 recommendations within 1ms.

Like themes and milestones, epics are about achievable and measurable goals. You might be thinking "we're measuring a lot of elements in our road map," but this measurement is key to having a realistic road map. At every level of the road map, you can determine progress towards objectives, what success looks like, have a clear measure of it, and adjust the objectives and measures if circumstances change. This measurement allows you to understand where the product is in terms of completion and success and is critical to managing your product’s delivery.
