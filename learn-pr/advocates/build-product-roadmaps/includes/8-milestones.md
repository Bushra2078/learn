A milestone is a collection of themes, epics, and stories. It might be a version of your product, for example, version 1.0 or it might be a month, three months, or another period. We strongly recommend time-boxing milestones, either explicitly by adding a target date or using a time-based interval like months or weeks.

Each milestone usually has a few themes associated with it. A milestone also allows you to report what you’re going to achieve to address that milestone and will enable you to measure progress towards that goal. This is likely the component that your leadership team or customer will be most interested in your reports on. So, you need to be realistic about what you can achieve in a milestone.

> This quarter we plan to focus on two themes: "Acquire more customers!" and "Reduce customer churn."

You’ll hopefully have some form of estimates in your stories, that rolls up into your epic. You know the resources available to you and should be able to solve for what’s possible in a milestone using this data. Again, having a tool that handles milestones and estimates automatically is useful.

Startups tend to be fast-moving, priorities, resourcing, and requirements change quickly, so most people don’t plan milestones beyond short and medium periods, for example, 1-6 months. Anything beyond that starts to become more like guesswork than planning. We suggest planning two milestones, say month 1 and month 2, so you know what you’re doing now and broadly what you plan to do next.
