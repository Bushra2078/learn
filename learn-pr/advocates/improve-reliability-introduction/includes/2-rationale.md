Whatever your role in the construction and operations of production
systems, reliability tends to be the number one worry that keeps you awake,
unable to go to sleep at night. It's ironically also reliability issues
that most often wake you with a page at 2:00 a.m.

You've seen the ugly red dashboards when something goes wrong and worse,
the angry posts from affected customers on social media when reliability
becomes an issue.

Reliability problems go beyond the immediate annoyance. They have a very
real and lasting impact on individuals and organizations. Reliability
issues can cause you and your organization to lose:

-   Money: lost business revenues, lost worker productivity, overtime pay

-   Time: outages are unplanned work that takes up time you had planned for
    other things

-   Reputation: customers are quick to lose patience and switch to a
    competitor when a service is seen to be flaky or slow

-   Health: interrupted sleep, family and vacation time are disturbed, no
    time for self-care, the stress of an unpleasant job and the inability
    to ever get caught up take a physical and psychological toll

-   Hiring: word gets out that your work environment is unpleasant and
    talented candidates do not apply for your open roles as a result

This means you have both a personal and professional stake in making your
systems and services as reliable as possible. The good news is that there
are steps you can take and tools you can use to help with reliability
issues.

In this learning path, you will find useful practices and resources to help
you improve reliability in your organization. One of the things people find
challenging around reliability work is there are so many different possible
steps you can take it can be overwhelming to get started and continue the
work. To help address that, we'd like to offer you a map to guide you so
you know what things to work on and in what order. First we'll see where
this guidance comes from and then we will dive right into that map.
