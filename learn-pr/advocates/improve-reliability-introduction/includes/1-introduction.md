The reliability of your systems, services, and products are crucial to your
success and the success of your organization. This is something we all know
as people in Operations, IT and IT management, DevOps, SRE, or even as a
developer responsible for the creation of software.

When you have put in countless amounts of resources into a product or
service - hired the best people, added fabulous features, trained up a
sales force to sell it â€“ if it isn't reliable, if it isn't available when
your customers need to use it, all of your effort has been wasted. As Lenny
Fenster, the CTO for the Microsoft Enterprise Services group says "all the
bells and whistles in the world aren't worth so much if the bells cannot be
rung nor the whistles blown."

The good news is, modern operations practices like site reliability
engineering and DevOps can help. Maybe you are reading this because you've
had a problem in the past with reliability or maybe you are concerned if
you don't nail it now, it will be a problem. In either case, this learning
path can help you get started with your reliability challenges.

One of the things that makes working on reliability in an organization
difficult is there are so many different ways to approach the subject, it
can be hard to know where to begin and in what order to proceed. This
module will provide a map that can help you decide what to work on and in
what order. The other modules in this learning path expand on each of the
topics in this map.

When you have completed this introduction module, you will:

-   Be able to express why reliability is crucial to your success

-   Learn about the modern operations practices that offer tools we can use
    to work on our reliability challenges

-   Be familiar with the Dickerson hierarchy of reliability and the map it
    provides for approaching reliability challenges

-   Be prepared for the individual modules that make up this learning path
