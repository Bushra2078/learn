  questions:
    - content: "What are the main recommended use cases for using Azure Cache for Redis?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use Azure Cache for Redis as a distributed cache."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You're partially right, but this answer isn't the only use case."
        - content: "Use Azure Cache for Redis as a data store for an HTTP session."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You're partially right, but this answer isn't the only use case."
        - content: "Use Azure Cache for Redis as a message broker."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You're partially right, but this answer isn't the only use case."
        - content: "All of the above."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. You can use Azure Cache for Redis as a distributed cache, a data store for an HTTP session, and a message broker."
    - content: "How does Azure Cache for Redis scale out a web application?"
      choices:
        - content: "It uses IP multicast to find other application nodes and share data among them."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Some alternative caching solutions use this mechanism, but not Azure Cache for Redis. It doesn't work well in a cloud environment."
        - content: "It acts as a central and scalable data store, where all application nodes can store and retrieve cached data."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. All nodes can store and retrieve data at scale by connecting to Azure Cache for Redis."
        - content: "It sends messages to every application node to invalidate stale data, so the nodes can then retrieve that data from a persistent database."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Some alternative caching solutions use this mechanism, but not Azure Cache for Redis."
        - content: "It stores cached data in a SQL database, so that application nodes can retrieve it easily."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Spring Session can use a SQL database to store its data, but it's an alternative and less effective solution than Azure Cache for Redis."
    - content: "What is the difference between Redis and Azure Cache for Redis?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure Cache for Redis is a limited version of Redis that focuses only on caching."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cache for Redis isn't a limited version of Redis."
        - content: "Azure Cache for Redis is an Azure Cosmos DB database that's compatible with Redis at the API layer."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cache for Redis uses the real Redis software."
        - content: "Azure Cache for Redis is a managed version of Redis that's maintained and operated by Azure."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Azure Cache for Redis is a managed version of Redis."
