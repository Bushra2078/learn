Node.js comes with many core libraries that handle everything from managing files to HTTP to compressing files and more. There is, however, a huge ecosystem of third-party libraries. Thanks to npm, Node Package Manager, you can easily install these libraries and use them in your application. 

Node.js and its ecosystem use the word *dependency* a lot. A dependency is a third-party library, a piece of reusable code that accomplishes something and can be added to your application. The third-party library is something your application *depends on* to function, hence the word *dependency*.

The third-party library can be thought of as a package and stored in a registry. So a package is a collection of files needed to run one or many modules. A package consists of one more many modules that you can import into your application so you can take advantage of its features.

## Determine whether you need a package

So how do you know if you need a package for your project? That's a complicated question that involves a few factors:

- **Getting better code**. Ask yourself if you're dealing with a task like security, for example, and are trying to implement authentication and authorization. It's a task that you need to *get right* to protect your data and your customer's data. There are standard patterns out there and libraries used by many developers. These libraries implement features you most likely will always need. And issues are patched as they arise. You should use such libraries instead of reinventing the wheel. The main reason is that you're not likely to do as good a job of writing the code yourself because there are so many edge cases that you'd need to consider.  
- **Saving time**. You could probably build most things yourself, like utility or UI component libraries. But it takes time. Even if the end result is comparable to what's out there, it's not a good use of your time to replicate the work of writing this code if you don't have to.
- **Maintenance**. All libraries and apps need maintenance sooner or later. Maintenance involves adding new features and correcting bugs. Is it a good use of your or your team's time to maintain a library? Or is it better to let an open-source software team handle it?

## Evaluate a package

Before you install a library, you might want to inspect the dependencies it relies on. These dependencies might encourage you to use the package, or they might deter you. Here are some factors to consider when you select a dependency for your project:

- **Size**. The number of dependencies could create a large footprint. If you're on a limited bandwidth or have other hardware limitations, this factor could be a concern.
- **Licensing**. Licensing might be a factor if you're producing software that you intend to sell. If you have a license on a third-party library, and the creator of the library doesn't allow it to be included in software that's for sale, the creator could put you in a bad legal situation.
- **Active maintenance**. If your package relies on a dependency that's deprecated or hasn't been updated for a long time, that could be a problem.

You can learn more about a package before installing it by going to `https://www.npmjs.com/package/<package name>`. This URL will take you to a detailed page for the package. Select the **Dependencies** tab to see how many packages and which packages it relies on to function. Another way to achieve a similar result is to run this npm command: `npm view <package name>`.

As for the listed dependencies, the number might not tell the whole truth. If you download a package, you might end up with a node_modules folder that contains thousands of packages. Why is that? Every package has a list of dependencies. To ensure you can use a package, all dependencies are crawled and downloaded when you run the `npm install <package name>` command.

## Install a package

You install a package by using a built-in command-line tool called npm. You can add a package to your Node.js project by invoking a command in the terminal. A typical installation command looks like this one: `npm install <name of package>`. When you run the `install` command, the command-line tool connects to a global registry, fetches the code, and places it in a node_modules folder for your project. After the installation, your project directory looks something like this one:

```bash
-| node_modules/
---| <name of dependency>/
------| <files included in the dependency>
```

## Find a package

Individual developers might use the global registry at npm to find and download packages they need for their apps. A company might have a strategy in place for what packages are OK to use and where to find them. Packages might be located in many different places. Some of these sources might be publicly available. Some might be restricted and accessible only to employees of a specific company. Here are some places where packages might reside:

- **Registries**. An example of a registry might be a global registry like the npm registry. You can host your own registries that can be either private or public.
- **Repositories**. Instead of pointing to a registry, it's possible to point to a GitHub URL and install a package from there.
- **Files**. You can install a package from a local folder or zipped file. Installation from a package is common when you're trying to develop your own Node.js libraries and want to test the package locally or for some reason don't want to use a registry.
- **Directories**. You can install right from a directory as well.
  
### The npm registry and tool

When you run `npm install <name of dependency>`, Node.js goes to a global registry called the npm registry and looks for the code to download. It's located at `http://npmjs.org`. You can browse this page for packages as well, if you visit it by using a browser. The site holds packages: zipped versions of source code. Every package has a dedicated website you can go to. On these sites, you can learn more about where the source code resides and find other information, like metrics on downloads and information about maintenance.

### npm commands

So far, you've learned how you can install dependencies by using the npm tool. But this tool can do a lot more. The npm command-line tool has quite a few commands. The commands help you with tasks like installing packages, authoring packages, and initializing Node.js projects. You don't need to know all the commands in detail. When you start out with Node.js, you're likely to run only a subset of the commands. As you expand your use of Node.js, you might run more and more commands from a variety of categories.

To help you remember what the commands do, it helps to think of them as belonging to categories:

- **Manage dependencies**. There are a number of commands that cover installation, removal, and cleaning up after package installations. There are commands for updating packages as well.
- **Run scripts**. The npm tool can help you manage flows in your application development. Examples of application flows are running tests, building code, or running quality improvement tools to lint your code.
- **Configure the environment**. There are many things you can configure, like where your installations end up and where packages should be installed from. It's common to have a setup that allows you to install packages from the global npm registry and also from a company-specific registry.
- **Author and publish packages**. There are several commands that can help you with tasks like creating a compressed package and pushing the package to a registry.

If you want a detailed list of all commands, enter `npm --help` in the terminal.

## Production vs. development dependencies

Dependencies belong to one of two categories:

- **Production dependencies**. Production dependencies are dependencies that you need to run an application in production. Examples include a web framework with which you can build a web application.
- **Development dependencies**. Development dependencies are dependencies that you need only when you develop your application. Think of these dependencies as you'd think of scaffolding for a building. When you're done building, you don't need them anymore. Examples of these dependencies are test libraries, linting tools, or bundling tools. These dependencies are an important part of ensuring your application works well, but you don't need to ship your application with them.

This separation isn't just conceptual. The npm tool writes to a manifest file by adding entries to it when you download dependencies. The tool allows you to differentiate between the two types of dependencies by adding a flag to the installation command. The flag places the name of the dependency and its version in a section called `dependencies` or `devDependencies`. This differentiation gives you a clear mental separation of the dependencies you have in your application and what type they are. Whichever type of dependency you install, it's stored in the node_modules directory. The flag affects only the manifest file.  

This separation of different types of dependencies is built into the npm command-line tool as well. If you specify the `--production` flag when you install a dependency, only `dependencies` will be installed. For example, this flag is used by continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure that only the dependencies needed to run the app are installed.

### How to install a package

You run the `npm install <dependency name>` command to install a normal dependency that's meant to be used as part of your application. The developer dependency is something that's not meant to be shipped to production. To install a developer dependency, add the `--save-dev` flag.

There are also packages that you can install *globally*. These packages are usually not meant to be imported into your project. For that reason, many global packages are CLI tools. Some of these packages do allow themselves to be imported, like `http-server`.

If you install something globally, it's not installed in a project's node_modules folder. Instead, it's installed in a computer-specific directory, so it's available for all Node.js projects on the computer. To install a global package, add the `-g` flag to the `install command`, so the command looks like this one: `npm install <dependency name> -g`.

However, the npx tool was created in part to address the fact that globally installed dependencies take up space after many them have been installed over time. Also, on many operating systems, a globally installed tool needs elevated permissions for installation. The main point is that global dependencies complete tasks that you most likely want to perform infrequently. So there's little need for these tools to be on your computer for more than a temporary period of time. 

The npx tool allows you to load the dependency into the Node.js process and run the command from there. After the command is run, the dependency is cleaned up and removed from your system. The npx tool has been shipped with all major versions of npm since version 5.2. This tool is the preferred way to use dependencies that are meant to be run infrequently. To use the npx tool, enter `npx <name of package>`. It will fetch the dependency, run the command, and clean up.

### After installation

The packages listed in the `dependencies` section of your package.json file will differ from the ones listed in the node_modules folder. If you want to see what packages are in the folder, you can enter `npm list`. But this command might produce a long list. It might be hard to get a sense of what you have in the folder. To help with this problem, you can list packages at different depths. When you do so, the `list` command looks like this one:

```bash
npm list --depth=<depth>
```

At depth `0`, the command lists the same content that you have in the `dependencies` section of your package.json. Because you installed the Jest package, `npm list --depth=0` will produce output similar to this output:

```output
├── jest@26.0.1
```

The `npm list` command will list all the packages in node_modules directory that were installed. Each installed package will have installed all the dependencies that it relies on.

Depth `1` allows you to see one level down: your installed packages and the primary dependencies that they consist of. If you run `npm list --depth=1`, you might see this output:

```output
├─┬ jest@26.0.1
│ ├── @jest/core@26.0.1
│ ├── import-local@3.0.2
│ └── jest-cli@26.0.1
```

As the `depth` number increases, you'll see more dependent packages.

## Clean up dependencies

Sooner or later, you're likely to realize that you no longer need a package. Or you might realize that the package you installed isn't the one you need. Maybe you've found one that will accomplish a task better. Whatever the reason, you should remove dependencies that you aren't using. Doing so keeps things clean. Also, dependencies take up space. 

The space argument becomes more important if you're building an SPA application by using a framework like Angular, React, or Vue. These applications are also Node.js projects. Building these apps involves a *bundling* and *minification* process in which different Node.js modules are concatenated and the source code is compressed. The resulting bundle or bundles end up being served from a browser. The larger the bundle is, the longer it takes to send over the network before it becomes something customers can interact with. The longer customers have to wait, the more likely they are to avoid your app.

There are two ways to clean up dependencies you no longer need:

- **Uninstall**. To uninstall a package, you run the `uninstall` command like so: `npm uninstall <name of dependency>`. This command will remove the package from the manifest file and from the node_modules folder.
- **Prune**. Or you can run the `prune` command like so: `npm prune`. Running this command will remove all dependencies in the node_modules folder that aren't listed as dependencies in the manifest file. This command is a good choice if you want to remove more than one dependency and you don't want to run the `uninstall` command for each dependency. To do so, remove entries from the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section and then run the `npm prune` command.
