You started with learning how to install dependencies that your app could use. Using dependencies in your application is something that will allow you to create an application faster as code is already written for you. Other good reasons for using dependencies, are that it's good idea to rely on tried and tested libraries rather than to write something yourself. Using *Tried and tested* libraries is a good recommendation for when adding authentication and authorization to your app.

Then you were introduced to different ways to install a dependency, local, global, and installation via the tool NPX. However, most dependencies you are likely to use is dependencies you install locally.

After that you ventured into an important topic how to update your dependencies. Dependencies are updated for various reasons in the form of bug fixes, new features, or even larger changes. Depending on the type of change, you are interested in the `package.json` file is where you configure per dependency what type of update you are interested in. Working in an enterprise environment it's recommended to have a thought out approach and decide on what type of updates you are ok with.

Finally the last unit of this module covered the `package.json` file in more detail. Various fields were covered and it focused on metadata fields, to describe your application.  It also focused on various scripts you can create to manage your Node.js project throughout the development phase.
