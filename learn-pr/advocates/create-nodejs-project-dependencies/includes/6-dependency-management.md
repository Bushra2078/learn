Sooner or later, you'll want to update to a new version of a library. Maybe a function is marked as deprecated. Or maybe there's a new feature in a later version of a package you're using. 

There are some considerations that you should take into account before you try to update a library:

- **The type of update**. What type of update is available? Is it a small bug fix? Is it adding a new feature I need? Will it break my code? You can communicate the type of update by using a system called *semantic versioning*. The way the version number of the library is expressed communicates to developers the type of update they're dealing with.
- **Whether the project is configured correctly**. You can configure your Node.js project so that you get only the types of updates you want. You'll only perform an update if a specific type of update is available. We recommend this approach because you don't risk running into surprises.
- **Security problems**. Managing your project dependencies over time involves being aware of problems that might occur. Problems arise as vulnerabilities are detected, for example. Ideally, patches will be released that you can download. The npm tool helps you run an *audit* on your libraries to find out if you have packages that should be updated. It also helps you take the appropriate action to fix a problem.

## Semantic versioning

There's an industry standard called semantic versioning. It's a system  adopted by numerous companies and developers. If you intend to publish packages and push them to the npm registry, you should definitely follow semantic versioning. It's expected. Even if you only download packages from the npm registry, you can expect these packages to follow semantic versioning.

So why is it such a big deal? Changes to a package can introduce risk. Risk that a bug that could harm your business could be introduced. Risk that you might need to rewrite part of your code. Rewriting code takes time, and time is money.  

Semantic versioning is how you express the type of change that you or some other developer is introducing to a library. Semantic versioning works by ensuring a package has a version number and that the version number is divided up into the following sections:

- **major version**, the leftmost number e.g `1` in `1.0.0`, changing major version means that we can expect breaking changes in the code. You might need to rewrite part of your code.
- **minor version**, the middle number, e.g,  the `2` in `1.2.0`, means features have been added. Your code should still be working. It's generally safe to update the minor version.
- **patch version**, the rightmost number, e.g,  the `3` in `1.2.3`, means a fix has been applied that *fixes* something in the code that should have worked. It should be safe to update patch version.

Below is a table showing different types and what number changes in what position.

|Type              | What happens          |
|------------------|----------------------|
|Major version     | 1.0.0 going to 2.0.0 |
|Minor version     | 1.1.1 going to 1.2.0 |
|Patch version     | 1.0.1 going to 1.0.2 |

## Updating a package with NPM

There are two ways to install a package, you can either use the `install` command or the `update` command. Historically there used to be differences between the two commands but now they act more like aliases for one another. A typical command to update could therefore look like so `npm update <name of package>@<optional argument with version number>`.

What happens at this point is depends on two things:

- **The version argument is specified as part of the command**, if the version argument (the last argument) is specified that particular package version will be fetched and installed.
- **There is an entry in the manifest file**, the entry in the manifest file consist of the name of the dependency plus a value expressing a rule pattern for how this dependency will be updated. Here's how it can look `"<name of dependency>": "1.1.x"`. NPM will respect the rule pattern and try to fetch the version of the dependency that matches the rule pattern.

### Update approach

How do we approach updating as Node.js developers? We can communicate to Node.js what behavior we want. We want to think about updating in terms of risk. You could reason like this:

- **Upgrade major version**, I'm ok to update to the latest major version as soon as it's out then I accept the fact that I might need to change code on my end.
- **Minor version**, I'm ok with a new feature being added. I'm not ok with code that breaks.
- **Patch version**, the only thing I'm ok with are bug fixes.

If you are in a new or smaller Node.js project, you can afford to be loose with how you define the update strategy and, for example,  allow to always update to the latest and greatest version. For more complex projects, there is a bit more nuance but we'll save that for a future module.

As a general guidance though, the smaller the dependency you are trying to update is the fewer dependencies it has in turn and the more likely it is that the update process is going to be easy.

### Configure the `package.json` for update

Before you go on an update one or many dependencies, you want to configure your manifest file in a way so that it's predictable what will happen if you run the `npm update <name of dependency>` command. You can communicate what approach you want to take for a package. Node.js has a set of symbols that allows us to define how we want our packages to update.

What we do is add different prefixes to our package entries in the `package.json` file. There are many things you can configure for apart from major/minor/patch version. It's also possible to express that you want packages within a certain range only or that you want a package with a certain tag like `alpha` or `beta` for example.

Here are some patterns to configure for major/minor/patch version:

- `~` or `1.1.x`, this instruction will update to the latest patch version. If you only want the patch version to update, you would specify like this `~1.0.0`. What this instruction says is equal or great to in the same range.
- `^` or `1.x.1`, this instruction will update only the minor version.
- `*` or `x.0.0`, this instruction will update to the highest major version.

## `package-lock.json`

Together with the `package.json` manifest file you also have the `package-lock.json` file. The latter is generated when you take an action that modifies `node_modules` directory or any kind of action changing the dependencies in `package.json`. So it would not be created on `npm init` but rather on a package install for example.

This file *should be committed* to your repository and why is that?

Well, for one it *guarantees exact installs*. Remember how in a `package.json` you define patterns for what type of installs you need like a patch, minor or major version? Patterns aren't very exact, you wouldn't know if you installed, for example,  version `1.4` or `1.5` with a `1.x` pattern. Why do I need to know that exactly? Imagine you have a scenario where you specify `1.x` and you at the time were using `1.2` and a new version `1.4` was released of that library that ended up breaking your code. Someone else installing your app will get a non-functioning app at that point. But, if there's a `package-lock.json` file stating `1.2` was used then `1.2` will be installed. So who cares about this behavior? The answer is people using your app/tool and CI, continuous integration tools.

It's important to understand how it's used and *what file* decides when an install operation is carried out. It works like this, if the `package.json` and what's in the `package-lock.json` agrees on semantic rule level, i.e the pattern says for example `1.x` in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` specifies that `1.4` is installed then `1.4` would be installed. However, if the `package.json` has been updated to let's say `1.8.x` then `package-lock.json` would not be obeyed and version and at least `1.8.0` would be installed, or higher patch version if available.

It should also be mentioned that there are other features that `package-lock.json` provides such as making it easy to see what changed between commits and help with optimizing the installing process.

## Find and update outdated packages

There's a command called `npm outdated` that will list outdated packages. Using that command can be a great help to find out when there are newer versions of packages that have been released. Here's what a typical output can look like when you run `npm outdated`:

```output
Package     Current  Wanted   Latest  Location
lodash        1.0.0   1.0.0  4.17.19  lock-test
node-fetch    1.2.0   1.2.0    2.6.0  lock-test
```

The above columns have the following meaning:

- `Wanted`, this column lists the latest version matching the semantic pattern you specified in the `package.json` file.
- `Latest`, lists the latest version of the package.
- `Location`, a column listing where dependency was found. The `outdated` command crawls through all installed packages in `node_modules`.

A recommended workflow is therefore running the following commands after each other:

1. Run `npm outdated`, lists all the outdated packages along with columns `Wanted`, `Latest` and `Location`:
1. Run `npm update <optional package name>`, running this command with a package name specified will attempt to update only that specific package. If package name is omitted, then it will attempt to update all the packages in `package.json`.

## Managing security issues

Every time you update or install a package you will get a log response just after install. It will tell you what version it installed and also if there are any vulnerabilities. An example log can look like this:

```output
+ lodash@1.3.1
added 1 package from 4 contributors and audited 1 package in 0.949s
found 3 vulnerabilities (1 low, 2 high)
  run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
```

Above its listing vulnerabilities in different severity levels, high, and low. If you have any high-level vulnerability, you should update. To fix an issue and apply an update, you can run `npm audit` as indicated by above log response. Doing so lists each vulnerability. A response from `npm audit` can look like this:

```bash
# Run  npm install lodash@4.17.15  to resolve 3 vulnerabilities

| Low            | Prototype Pollution               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Package        | lodash                            |
| Dependency of  | lodash                            |
| Path           | lodash                            |
| More info      | https://npmjs.com/advisories/577  |  

and so on..
```

The command `npm audit fix` attempts to fix the problem to a point. It tries to upgrade to a minor version where the problem no longer exists. That action may not be enough, it may tell you that you need to run `npm audit fix --force` to fix the problem. Such an action involves a breaking change i.e the major version of your package will be updated.

So what is a vulnerability? A Vulnerability is a weakness in the code that can be exploited to do malicious things. An attacker can use this weakness to gain access to your data and your systems. You should take a vulnerability seriously for that reason.

Vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. It's so common that GitHub spent time to implement a function that scans repos and automatically creates a PR on your repo with a suggestion to upgrade to a more safe version, if it finds vulnerability. You do best to run the audit command `npm audit` now and then. Safety is everyone's job. A large repo provider like GitHub does their part, you can do your part by auditing and fix the vulnerabilities if you discover any.
