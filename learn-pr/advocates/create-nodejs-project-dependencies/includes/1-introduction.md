Welcome to the exciting world of application development! As you build your application, you'll be implementing business requirements. But why reinvent the wheel? You'll be using external _packaged_ code to speed up your development process and ensure reliability. This is where **NPM**, the **Node Package Manager**, comes into play. Think of NPM as your trusty sidekick, simplifying how you discover, use, and share code with others.

In this adventure, you'll wield the **npm command-line tool** and the **npm global registry** to add dependencies as _packages_ to your application code. You'll also master the art of package updates and learn how to tackle potential issues.

Relying on external, packaged code empowers you to:

* **Accelerate your app development** by using existing packages. This is like using a prebuilt engine (React, Angular, Vue) for your JavaScript front-end or back-end (Express.js, Restify.js).
* **Connect with Cloud services swiftly** using packages provided by the Cloud provider. For instance, the Azure SDK for JavaScript is your key to integrating with Azure services.
* **Adopt best practices** by using packages crafted by experts. For instance, the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) is your secret weapon for integrating with Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and authorization.
* **Delegate development tasks** to packages that handle tasks like linting and transpiling. Your allies here include ESLint, Babel, TypeScript, and Webpack.
* **Test your code** using packages that provide testing frameworks. Your companions for this journey include Jest and Playwright.
