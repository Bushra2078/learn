  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
    - content: "How would you install a test framework like Jest?"
      choices:
        - content: "Run `npm install jest`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This command installs Jest, but it installs it as a normal dependency. We don't recommend installing Jest as a normal dependency because the dependency will ship with the application."
        - content: "Run `npm install jest --save-dev`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This command installs Jest as a dev dependency. A test framework is something you need only during development."
        - content: "Run `npm install jest --save`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This command installs Jest in the `dependencies` section. We recommend that any library that's used only during development is installed as a dev dependency. And you don't need to add the `--save` flag. This flag is left over from when it was needed to persist the installed library in the package.json file."
        - content: "npm download jest --save-dev"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There is no `download` command. Use `install`."
    - content: "Why would you use npx?"
      choices:
        - content: "The dependency is downloaded directly into the Node.js process and is removed after the command is run. This tool is great for when you want to run commands infrequently."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: ""
        - content: "Installing dependencies by using npx is more secure than installing them globally."
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "Installing dependencies by using npx is faster than installing them globally."
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "You don't have to use sudo before running it as you would for a global installation."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This answer is technically correct, but this shouldn't the reason you choose npx over a global installation. Global installs are something that remains on your system and you need to uninstall. There's no such need with NPX as it cleans up after itself."
    - content: "What's a way to instruct the `package.json` file that you only want patch (bug fixes) updates"
      choices:
        - content: "Locate the entry in dependencies or devDependencies. Set the entry to look like this \"<library>\": \"*\""
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This will update the dependency to the latest possible version. This is incorrect."
        - content: "Locate the entry in dependencies or devDependencies. Set the entry to look like this \"<library>\": \"1.x.0\""
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This will update the dependency to the latest minor version. That's not what you want"
        - content: "Locate the entry in dependencies or devDependencies. Set the entry to look like this \"<library>\": \"1.0.x\""
          isCorrect: true
        - content: "Locate the entry in dependencies or devDependencies. Set the entry to look like this \"<library>\": \"^1.0.x\""
          isCorrect: false
    - content: "What are some recommended scripts to set up in your Package.json at the start of a project?"
      choices:
        - content: "start, test, build"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "These are all good scripts to set up. As you working in JavaScript it's good if you set up a linter tool as well to ensure your code looks consistent."
        - content: "start, test"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Having a script for start and test is good. It's also recommended that you have a script for how to build your solution. Additionally having a way to *lint* your files ensure you and your team members can write code in a consistent way."
        - content: "start"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This isn't nearly enough. Look into setting up commands for test, build, and linting as well."
        - content: "start, test, lint, and build"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Having all these scripts set-up is great way to start any Node.js project."
