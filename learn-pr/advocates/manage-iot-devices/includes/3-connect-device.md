In this unit, you'll interact with the online Raspberry Pi simulator that you learned about in the previous unit.

Although this exercise is being conducted in a simulated environment, the app running on the simulated device is similar to the code that would be running on a real device. In the IoT world, device simulation is a valuable step in building a production-grade solution.

## Create an IoT hub

To start collecting data from the Raspberry Pi simulator, you need to first create an IoT hub.

1. Right-click [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), and select **Open in new window**.

1. Choose **Create a resource** in the upper-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for **IoT Hub**.

1. Create an IoT hub resource.

   [![Screenshot of the Azure portal menu bar](../media/iot-admin-create-hub.png)](../media/iot-admin-create-hub.png#lightbox)

1. In the **IoT hub** pane, enter the following information for your IoT hub:

   - **Subscription**: Use the **Concierge subscription** for this example. This entry is the sandbox subscription.
   - **Resource group**: Use the sandbox resource group.
   - **Name**: Create a unique name for your IoT hub. For example, use something like **PiHub-your-id**, but replace "your-id" with something appropriate. If the name you enter is available, a green check mark appears.
   - **Region**: Select the closest region to your location.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The IoT hub will be publicly discoverable as a DNS endpoint, so make sure to avoid any sensitive information while naming it.

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Review your IoT hub information, and then select **Create**. Your IoT hub might take a few minutes to deploy. 

1. Select **Go to resource** when the deployment is complete.

## Register a device

A device must be registered with your IoT hub before the device can connect.

1. In your IoT hub navigation menu, open **IoT devices**, and then select **+ New**.

1. For **Device ID**, enter an ID for the new device. Choose something meaningful, like **PiHubDevice-your-id** (again replacing "your-id" with something appropriate). Device IDs are case-sensitive.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The device ID might be visible in the logs collected for customer support and troubleshooting, so don't use any sensitive information while naming it.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Open the device from the list in the **IoT devices** pane.

1. Copy the **Primary Connection String** information to a text file, to use in the next section. The icon to the right of the string copies the key to the clipboard for you.

## Send simulated telemetry

1. Right-click [Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Simulator](https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator?azure-portal=true), and select **Open in new window**.

1. Replace the placeholder in line 15 with the connection string (for the Azure IoT hub device) from your text file.

   [![Screenshot showing where to replace the device connection string](../media/iot-admin-line-15.png)](../media/iot-admin-line-15.png#lightbox)

1. Select the `Run` button, or enter `npm start` in the console window, to run the application.

1. You should see output similar to the following, showing the sensor data and messages sent to your IoT hub.

1. Make sure you don't miss the LED flash, each time a message is sent!

## Read the telemetry from your hub

So what's happening? IoT hub is receiving the device-to-cloud messages sent from the simulated device. To see that, let's take a quick look at how Azure IoT Hub is processing the incoming data.

1. In your IoT hub, under **Monitoring**, select **Metrics**.

1. For **Metric**, locate **Telemetry messages sent**. It's near the end of the list of available metrics. Select **Sum** for **Aggregation**.

1. Change the time range to **Last 30 minutes**. Wait a few minutes for the data to enter the picture.

   [![Screenshot showing the Pi simulator Run button](../media/iot-admin-device-metrics.png)](../media/iot-admin-device-metrics.png#lightbox)

1. The shape of the graph will depend on the volume of messages arriving, and the sequence of `Run`, `Stop`, and `Reset` commands that you use. Feel free to stop, and restart, the sending of telemetry. Notice how the graph changes, and when it changes, as there's some latency.

### Next steps

For the penultimate unit of this module, let's look at some of the most useful left-hand menu entries for your job as hub administrator.
