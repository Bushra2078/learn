Capturing of weather data is an important task as weather can effect everything
from traffic patterns to how heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in retail stores are operated. In this
exercise, you will be interacting with the online Raspberry Pi simulator you learned about in the previous unit to capture
simulated weather data and via the Azure IoT Hub.

While this exercise is being conducted in a simulated environment, the application running on the simulated device can be transferred to a real device in the future.
