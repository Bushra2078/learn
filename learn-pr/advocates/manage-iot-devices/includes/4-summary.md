Azure IoT Hub provides the features, and an extensibility model, that enable developers to build robust remote device management solutions. Devices range from constrained sensors and single purpose microcontrollers, to powerful gateways that route communications for groups of devices. Also, the use cases and requirements for IoT operators vary significantly across industries. Despite this variation, device management with IoT Hub provides the capabilities to cater to a diverse set of devices, end users, and objectives.
