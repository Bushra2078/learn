  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "True or false: IoT Hub is an Azure service that enables back-end developers to build device management solutions?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure IoT Hub provides features and an extensibility model that enables device and back-end developers to build robust device management solutions. Devices range from constrained sensors and single purpose microcontrollers, to powerful gateways that route communications for groups of devices."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure IoT Hub provides features and an extensibility model that enables device and back-end developers to build robust device management solutions. Devices range from constrained sensors and single purpose microcontrollers, to powerful gateways that route communications for groups of devices."    

  - content: "True or false: you can't receive telemetry data in the Azure portal when using the Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Simulator?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even though you're not using physical hardware, you can still receive telemetry data when using the Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Simulator."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Even though you're not using physical hardware, you can still receive telemetry data when using the Raspberry Pi Azure IoT Simulator."

    choices:
    - content: 'Properties and Settings'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These are left-hand menu entries, not metrics.
    - content: 'Device to cloud messages, and Cloud to device messages'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There are a range of metics for messages going either way, but cloud to device messages are not shown by default.
    - content: "Telemetry data sent, and Successful twin reads from back end"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: For a single device, the first metric might show a few hundred messages, and the second metric will show 1.
    - content: "Device to cloud messages, and Device twin operations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, these are the titles of the tiles, not the names of the metrics.

  - content: 'What left-hand menu option do you select to view the hub keys?'
    choices:
    - content: 'IoT devices'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This will give you the device keys, but not the hub keys.
    - content: 'Shared access policies'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The keys are displayed by clicking on a policy, such as iothubowner.
    - content: 'Properties'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This provides information on names, location, subscription, and so on. But not the keys.
    - content: 'Security'
