  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What steps must you go through in constructing a Web application with Express?"
      choices:
        - content: "Instantiate an app, configure routes, set up middleware, set up error handlers, listen to the server"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. These are definitely steps you could take in setting up your app. However, only instantiation and listen to server are steps you must do, everything else is optional"
        - content: "Instantiate an app, listen to the server"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This is all you need to get an app up and running. You ar strongly recommended to configure some routes however"
        - content: "Instantiate an app, configure routes, listen to the server"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You don't actually need to configure routes although it's highly recommended"
        - content: "Instantiate an app, configure routes, set up middleware, listen to the server"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Neither configuring routes or set up middleware are things you must do, even though it's highly recommended"
    - content: "What are the ways you can ensure the response is sent as JSON from an Express app?"
      choices:
        - content: "Call the json() helper method on the response object like so: res.json({ content: '' })"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The json() method is a valid way, but there are more ways"
        - content: "Call res.json() and res.contentType('application/json')"
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "Call res.json(), res.contentType('application/json') or res.type('json')"
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "Use any of these ways: res.type('json'), res.type('application/json'), res.contentType('application/json'), res.format({ 'application/json': function() { res.send({}) } })"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "These are all the available ways that a response can be sent as JSON"
    - content: "How would set up Express to handle a POST request with JSON data?"
      choices:
        - content: "Call app.use(bodyParser.json()) at the top, register a route using the post method, like so app.post(<route>, () =>{}), read from req.body"
          isCorrect: true
        - content: "Register a route using the post method, like so app.post(<route>, () =>{}), read from req.body"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You need to configure a body pasting middleware or the posted data won't be available on req.body"
        - content: "Configure body parsing middleware, register a route using the post method, like so app.post(<route>, () =>{}), read from req.data"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "the posted data is available on req.body NOT req.data"
        - content: "Call app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })) at the top, register a route using the post method, like so app.post(<route>, () =>{}), read from req.body"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The configuration at the top is wrong. That will configure it to receive posted data from a Form that is URL encoded. It needs to be app.use(bodyParser.json())."
