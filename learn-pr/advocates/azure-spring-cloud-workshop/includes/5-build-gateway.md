In this module, we will build a [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway) and deploy it on Azure Spring Cloud.

Gateways are used to route public HTTP traffic to microservices:

- They handle the routing logic.
- They secure the access to the microservices (which will not be publicly available).
- They can also have Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities, like doing HTTP rate limiting.

## Create a Spring Cloud Gateway

To create our gateway, we will use [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/) with the command line:

```bash
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz -d dependencies=cloud-gateway,cloud-eureka,cloud-config-client -d baseDir=gateway -d bootVersion=2.3.6.RELEASE -d javaVersion=1.8 | tar -xzvf -
```

> [!NOTE]
> We use the `Cloud Gateway`, `Eureka Discovery Client` and the `Config Client` components.

## Configure the application

In the `src/main/resources/application.properties` configuration file, add the following property:

```yaml
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true
```

- The `spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true` part is to configure Spring Cloud Gateway to use the Spring Cloud Service Registry to discover the available microservices.

## Create the application on Azure Spring Cloud

As in the previous module, create a specific `gateway` application in your Azure Spring Cloud instance. As this application is a gateway, we add the `--is-public true` flag so it is exposed publicly.

```bash
az spring-cloud app create -n gateway --is-public true
```

## Deploy the application

You can now build your "gateway" project and send it to Azure Spring Cloud:

```bash
cd gateway
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
az spring-cloud app deploy -n gateway --jar-path target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
cd ..
```

## Test the project in the cloud

1. Go to **Apps** in your Azure Spring Cloud instance.
    1. Verify **gateway** has a Discovery status that says UP(1),DOWN(0). This shows that it is correctly registered in the Spring Cloud Service Registry.
    1. Select **gateway** to have more information on the microservice.
1. Copy/paste the public URL that is provided (there is a "Test Endpoint" like for microservices, but the gateway is directly exposed on the Internet, so let's use the public URL). Keep this URL handy for subsequent sections.

As the gateway is connected to the Spring Cloud Service Registry, it should have automatically opened routes to the available microservices, with URL paths in the form of `/MICROSERVICE-ID/**`:
[The MICROSERVICE-ID must be in capital letters]

Test the `todo-service` microservice endpoint by doing: `curl https://XXXXXXXX-gateway.azuremicroservices.io/TODO-SERVICE/` (replacing XXXXXXXX with the name of your Azure Spring Cloud instance)

As in the previous module, the result of this command should be the three items that were initially inserted in the Azure Cosmos DB database:

```json
[{"id":"1","description":"First item","done":true},{"id":"2","description":"Second item","done":true},{"id":"3","description":"Third item","done":false}]
```
