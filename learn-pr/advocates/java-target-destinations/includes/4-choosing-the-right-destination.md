We've seen the different options available to deploy a Java applications on the cloud, and more specifically on Azure. But which option is the best, depending on your specific needs? Here's a guide to help you choose.

# Choosing the right destination

## Building everything vs using a managed service

The first question you should have, is whether you want full control of your application, or use a managed service. It usually depends on your needs, and on the team you are working with.

- If you are using some specific proprietary software, or some non-common Java features, a managed service might be the right fit for you. For example, you might want to use network broadcasting to find your application nodes, and this won't be available on a managed service. Or you might want to use some specific native library, which also will not be able to run on a managed service.
