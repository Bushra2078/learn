Organizations often run many different Java workloads, from simple applications to highly complex, mission-critical microservices architectures.

An e-commerce Website could have a highly-scalable customer-facing store that relies on hundreds of Spring Boot services, and also have monolithic back-office system to handle its catalog, as well as many smaller batch applications to update its stocks and notify its customers.

Azure provides many ways to run Java, from simple virtual machines to containers or serverless functions: it will have one, or maybe even several solutions that will fit your needs, even in our example of a complex e-commerce website. This module will give you an introduction to those solutions, as well as tools to help you choose which ones are the most appropriate for your specific use-case.
