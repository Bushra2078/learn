## Introduction

It’s quite common these days that people work remotely, from their home, a coffee shop or a similar establishment. Regardless of where you work, you want a secure connection from your machine to your company’s resources. It’s important that these connections are secure, which has come to mean encrypted to protect your company. Additionally, it’s advantageous to use tools that make setting up and configuring such connections so that more time can be spent to deliver business value.

As a developer, you're likely to build many programs on one machine. Those programs might also be used on other machines. However, some of these machines might have versions of Python installed that aren't what you expect. Or, they might have libraries installed that are of lower or higher version than your program needs. 


|Command  |Description  |
|---------|-------------|
|Row 1     |  data      |
|Row 2     |         |
|Row 3     |         |

  

So what do you do? You need to find a way for your program to work in isolation, so it doesn't disturb what's installed on the target machine. You also want to make sure that a machine doesn't disable your program because it has the wrong Python version or library version installed. 

  

## Scenario: Let's build a program 

As your skills grow and you begin building more advanced programs, you always want to start with a good approach. You want to think of the program that you build as more of a project, with the code spread out over many files. If possible, you also want to use libraries that others have written, to speed up development time. 


## What will you learn? 

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

- Explain what is tunneling & how remote tunnels securely transmit data  
- Use Remote-Tunnels extension 

## What is the main objective? 

Use libraries and plan your project to create Python programs that are more advanced. 

 ```python
code

/env
  /bin
  /include
  /lib
```
## unit
This should be conceptually heavy. Try to stay at <=5 min.
Download the extension `Read Time` to get help with this.

There should be little to no code here.
