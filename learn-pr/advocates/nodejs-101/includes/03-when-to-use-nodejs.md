Node.js has become one of the most used technologies by many giant companies and startups (Netflix, Trello, Walmart, Uber, Ebay, and NASA).

Node.js is a single-threaded non-blocking runtime; it's based on the event-driven I/O paradigm and is capable of executing JavaScript outside the browser. The Non-blocking aspect means that, for instance, when a remote client makes a request, a server written in JavaScript and running on Node.js would handle that request and would construct and send back a response; then move on to the next request, without blocking and waiting for other tasks to finish.

The main benefits of using Node.js are:

## Multi-purpose technology

Node.js can be used to build a wide variety of production ready applications. From the traditional lightweight and high traffic chat applications, that run across distributed devices; to command line tools and web servers. Node.js was designed from the ground up to handle a high number of concurrent requests and requests.

## JavaScript

_"Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript."_ â€“ Jeff Atwood, Author, Entrepreneur, Cofounder of StackOverflow.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, it can run and execute your JavaScript applications and code on the server in particular, and outside the browser in general.

Nowadays, many applications, outside the browser, are written in JavaScript or support JavaScript as a first class-citizen language:

- Code editors such as Visual Studio Code and Atom are written in JavaScript or TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript with static typings). They run an embedded version of the Node.js runtime.
- Many IoT (Internet Of Things) and real-time applications are written in JavaScript and rely on Node.js to run, either on the server or microcontrollers and SoC (System on a Chip) platforms such as the Puck-js or the Tessel.
- Technologies such as NativeScript allow us to use JavaScript (or TypeScript) to build high-performing native mobile applications.
- Many applications use JavaScript for their plugin-system, for example Sketch, Adobe XD, and Google App Script.

## Community

The community has already built over a million modules and libraries for Node.js, and published on NPM, a Node.js Package Manager. Developers can easily download and integrate those modules into their existing projects. The number of applications that can run on Node.js are endless: from command-line tools (that is, the Hexa CLI), to frameworks (that is, Nest.js), web servers (that is, Express.js), and more.

## Open Source

Node.js is open source and supported by the The OpenJS Foundation. It has a massive active open-source community and contributors working hard to improve and optimize the technology. There is even a Community top-level committee that has authority over outward-facing community outreach efforts.
