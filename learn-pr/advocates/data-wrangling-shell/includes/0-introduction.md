Have you ever needed to transform data from one format to another?
As a developer, this is a common task. Whether you're trying to extract information from logs or from incoming streams, you'll need to deal with raw data and transform it before it's usable.

In this module, you'll learn how to wrangle (transform) data using the UNIX shell. You'll be introduced to some commonly used tools and the basics of regular expressions.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Do basic file inspection with commands such as `head`, `tail`, `wc` , `nl`, and `sort`.
- Use `cat` to create append, display, and concatenate files.
- Write and use simple `regex` (regular expressions) for text pattern matching (note that this isn't an in-depth introduction to regex).
- Use `grep` to search files or `stdin` for pattern matching along with `regex`.
- Do basic text transformations on input streams using `sed` and `regex`.
- Use pipe and filters for data wrangling.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of the command line and basic shell commands
