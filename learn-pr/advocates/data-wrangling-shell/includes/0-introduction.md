# Introduction

Have you ever needed transforming data from one format to another? 
As a developer, this is a very common task. Whether you are trying to extract some information from some logs or incoming streams. You will often need to deal with raw data and transform it before it is actually usable.

In this module, you'll learn how to wrangle (transform) data using the UNIX shell. You'll be introduced to some commonly used tools as well as to the basics of regular expressions.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will begin to discover:

- Perform basic file inspection with commands such as `head`, `tail`, `wc` , `nl` and `sort`
- Use `cat` to create append, display and concatenate files
- Write and use simple `regex` (regular expressions) for text pattern matching (note that this is not an in-depth introduction to regex)
- Use `grep` to search files or `stdin` for pattern matching along with `regex`
- Perform basic text transformations on input streams using `sed` and `regex`
- Use pipe and filters for data wrangling

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of the command line and basic shell commands
