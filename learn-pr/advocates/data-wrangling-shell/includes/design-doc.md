# Title

Use the Unix Shell to wrangle log data

## Role(s)

- student
- data scientist
- data engineer
- developer

## Level

- beginner

## Product(s)

- Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of the command line and basic shell commands

## Summary

In this module you will learn how you can use the Unix Shell to manipulate data and turn it into a different format. The purpose of doing these transformations is to have data in a usable and readable format that can later be used to extract insights of perform analytics tasks on.
You will first analyse NASA data log files to understand their content and create a unified data log. Then you will create more complex instructions to transform logs and extract key information from this new log.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this module the learner will be able to:

1. Perform basic file inspection with commands such as `head`, `tail`, `wc` , `less` and `sort`
2. Use `cat` to create append, display and concatenate files
3. Write and use `regex` (regular expressions) for text pattern matching
4. Use `grep` to search files or `stdin` for pattern matching along with `regex`
5. Perform basic text transformations on input streams using `sed` and `regex`
6. Use pipe and filters for data wrang
