  questions:

  - content: 'The Spherical Mercator projection coordinate system does what to the map'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Makes it round'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Spherical Mercator projection coordinate system stretches the map at both the North and South poles. This stretching makes a square map that can be rendered on a flat screen
    - content: 'Colors it in green and blue'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Spherical Mercator projection coordinate system stretches the map at both the North and South poles. This stretching makes a square map that can be rendered on a flat screen
    - content: 'Stretches the map at the poles'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The Spherical Mercator projection coordinate system stretches the map at both the North and South poles. This stretching makes a square map that can be rendered on a flat screen
    
  - content: 'Heat map layers show...'
    choices:
    - content: 'The density of data using a range of colors'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct, heat map layers represent the density of data using a range of colors to show 'hot spot' areas on a map.
    - content: 'The current temperature of the planet'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Heat map layers represent the density of data using a range of colors to show 'hot spot' areas on a map.
    - content: 'The height above sea level'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Heat map layers represent the density of data using a range of colors to show 'hot spot' areas on a map.

  - content: 'What GeoJSON object is used to render a layer on a map'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Geometry'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Maps uses data sources containing GeoJSON feature collections to render layers on the map.
    - content: 'Feature'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Maps uses data sources containing GeoJSON feature collections to render layers on the map.
    - content: 'Feature Collection'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Azure Maps uses data sources containing GeoJSON feature collections to render layers on the map.

  - content: 'How can you get the coordinates of the part of the map visible in the browser?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Get the bounds property from the maps camera'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct, the viewable area of the map is controlled by a camera. The camera has a bounds property that defines the north-west and south-east corners of the visible map.
    - content: 'Get the top, bottom, left, and right coordinates from the map control'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The viewable area of the map is controlled by a camera. The camera has a bounds property that defines the north-west and south-east corners of the visible map.
