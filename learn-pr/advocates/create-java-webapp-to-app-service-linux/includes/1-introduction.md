Web applications are used for accounting, inventory, and online web portals.
A rich web application improves the User Experience.
Typically, your application accepts input from users, searches data for the input contents, displays a list, and updates it. For example, you can enter a name or address, select a product, and press a button to purchase a product.  
In this module, we'll create a Todo application by using JavaServer Faces. Many of the same steps apply to other technologies like Servlets, Java Server Pages, and Java REST services.

After created the Application, we will deploy it to the Apache Tomcat on Azure App Service which is provided as Platform as a Service.
As a result, You will be able to learn how to create Java Web Application and verify how to provide the service on the cloud.
