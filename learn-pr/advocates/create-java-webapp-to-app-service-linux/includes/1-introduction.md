As an execution environment, Apache Tomcat started its project in November 1998, is provided as a reference implementation of Servlet and JSP and provided as Open Source, and has been used by many users.

This module creates a simple Todo application as Java Web application and runs it on Azure App Service.s
Todo applications use JSF as the MVC framework and PrimeFaces for their implementation.
JSF is a component-based framework that allows you to create Java Web applications.
PrimeFaces provides extended UI component of JSF, which makes it easier to create rich Ajax-enabled Web Application such as Single Page Application(SPA).
