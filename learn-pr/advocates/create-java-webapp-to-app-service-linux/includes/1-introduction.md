There are various services provided by companies, such as accounting systems, production management systems, inventory management systems, customer management systems, and deposit account management systems.
When building such a system as a Web Application, it is necessary to build a rich web application in order to improve UX (User Experience). And in many systems, it accepts input from users, searches data for the input contents, displays a list, and updates it. For example, you can enter a name or address, select a product, and press the purchase button then you can purchase the product from the Internet.  
In order to implement such a web application, it is necessary to handle the user input from a text field, display items, and processing when a button is pressed.
In this module, in order to easily implement these kind of the Application, we will create a simple ToDo application by using JavaServer Faces Technology which is widely used in the world. And this procedure is also able to apply for other technologies like Servlet, JSP, JAX-RS.

After created the Application, we will deploy it to the Apache Tomcat on Azure App Service which is provided as Platform as a Service.
As a result, You will be able to learn how to create Java Web Application and verify how to provide the service on the cloud.
