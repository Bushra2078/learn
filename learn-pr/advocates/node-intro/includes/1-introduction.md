# Introduction

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on top of the JavaScript engine V8, it's open source and also cross platform. That means it should work well to run your application on Windows as well as Linux or Mac.

Node.js is JavaScript that executes outside of the Browser. It makes it a great choice for building various applications such as, but not limited to:

- CLI tools
- Scripts
- Server backends

Node.js also has an event-driven architecture enabling you to run asynchronous code. It was first created in 2009 and has had many great features added to it like for example the package manager. The package manager called NPM is something we will learn to use throughout this module.

This module covers how to get started with Node.js. We will therefore cover the following areas:

- Learn about different ways to Install Node.js.
- Discover how to use the REPL to carry out different commands.
- Leverage the package manager NPM to add supporting libraries to your application.

Let's begin.
