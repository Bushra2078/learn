One important step towards improving your reliability is to prevent
incidents whenever possible. And when you do have incidents, tracking down
the problem quickly is also important. The test/release or deployment
process can have a strong impact on both of these goals.

In this module, you've:

-   learned about what software deployment is and different kinds of
    deployments we might employ
-   discussed the significant benefits of switching from an "epic
    deployment" model to a "continuous deployment" model
-   explored the components of continuous deployment
-   looked deeper into pipelines and how they are implemented in Azure
    Pipelines
-   learned a number of different strategies for deployment to production
    that can help us avoid incidents
-   examined some important best practices that can minimize the risk when
    rolling out new software or a new version of existing software
