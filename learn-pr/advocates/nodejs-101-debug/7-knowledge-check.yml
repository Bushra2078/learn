  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "How do you run Node.js with inspect mode enabled?"
      choices:
        - content: "With the command `node inspect myscript.js`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This command is starts your program with the built-in debugger."
        - content: "With the command `node --inspect myscript.js`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Use the `--inspect` option to allow debugger clients to connect to the Node.js process."
        - content: "With the command `node myscript.js"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "For security reasons, the use of debugger must be enabled explicitly when running Node.js."
        - content: "By typing `debug` in the Node.js REPL"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A debugger can only be used on an existing program and does not work in the REPL environment."
    - content: "How can you make a debugger pause the execution of your program on a specific line of code?"
      choices:
        - content: "With the command `node --inspect-brk myscript.js`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This command runs Node.js in inspect and pause execution before your program code."
        - content: "By stepping through your code until you reach the desired line."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While this technique may work for small programs, it's not practical if you have thousands of lines of code."
        - content: "By commenting out unwanted code."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Commenting out code can alter your program behavior and does not help you to pause the execution."
        - content: "By setting a breakpoint in your code."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "When using a debugger, you can using breakpoints to pause execution at specific points in your code."
