Have you ever wanted to take data from one format into another? It's likely that you have or that you'll have to do it in the future. The process is called *data wrangling* and is a common task faced by developers. Before we learn how to wrangle data, we need some data files to work with.

As a developer, you'll often need to extract information from logs. In this module, we'll use NASA logs and the command line. To get started, you'll need to download the datasets to your sandbox environment.

1. Make a directory called `data`, and download the dataset.

    ```bash
    mkdir data
    wget
    ```

1. Verify that you have the correct files by using the command `ls`.

   ```bash
   # first we change to the data directory
   cd data
   # now we display its contents
   ls
   ```

You should see a `NASA-software-API.txt` file and a `NASA-logs-1995.txt` file.

The first file, `NASA-Software-API.txt`, is an open dataset that lists all the software in use by NASA. For more information on the original dataset, see [NASA Open Source and General Resource Software API](https://data.nasa.gov/Management-Operations/NASA-Open-Source-And-General-Resource-Software-API/4tfb-za6v). The second dataset contains all the logged requests to the NASA Kennedy Space Center server.

## Peek into the contents of your files

Recall that in UNIX, by default, a terminal has three streams: an input stream and two output-based streams. The input stream is referred to as `stdin` for standard input and is mapped to the keyboard. The standard output stream, or `stdout`, generally prints to the terminal or might be consumed by another program or process. The other output stream, `stderr`, is primarily used for status reporting and usually prints to the terminal like `stdout`.

You might be wondering why you needed that refresher. In the following units, we'll be talking about programs and filters and their standard input and output. You'll need a basic understanding of how these items are related. All of this information will make more sense as you move forward in the module.

Before you jump into wrangling your data, it's useful to do some basic file inspection. You want to get an idea of what the raw data looks like.

### `Head` and `tail` commands

The `head` and `tail` commands are used to examine the top (head) or bottom (tail) parts of a file. By default, both commands display 10 rows of content. If you want to display more or less rows, you can use the option flag `-n` to specify the number of rows to be printed to `stdout`.

We'll use the `tail` and `head` commands to display the last and first five rows of the `NASA-software-API.txt` file, respectively.

1. Type the command `tail` with the `-n` flag.

    ```bash
    tail -n 5  NASA-software-API.txt
    ```

    Your output should look like so:

    ```output
   SSC-00393 SSC 2013-05-17T00:00:00.000 "General Public" "Software Suite to Support In-Flight Characterization of Remote Sensing Systems"
   SSC-00424 SSC 2013-09-06T00:00:00.000 "General Public" "SSC Site Status Mobile Application"
   GSC-14732-1 GSFC 2004-06-09T00:00:00.000 "Open Source" "Tool For Interactive Plotting, Sonification, And 3D Orbit Display (TIPSOD)"
   GSC-14730-1 GSFC 2004-06-09T00:00:00.000 "Open Source" "Space Physics Data Facility Web Services"
   GSC-14726-1 GSFC 2004-06-09T00:00:00.000 "Open Source" "Earth Observing System (EOS) Clearinghouse (ECHO)"
    ```

1. Type the command `head` with the `-n` flag.

     ```bash
     # to display only the first 5 rows in the file
     head -n 5 NASA-software-API.txt
     ```
    
     ```output
     ARC-14136-1 ARC 2001-10-19T00:00:00.000 "Academic Worldwide" "Adaptive Relevance-Learning Software Component (ARNIE)"
     ARC-14293-1 ARC 2005-09-19T00:00:00.000 "Open Source" "Genetic Graphs (JavaGenes)"
     ARC-14297-1 ARC 2003-11-06T00:00:00.000 "General US" "Automated Domain Decomposition Software, PEGASUS Version 5.0"
     ARC-14379-1 ARC 2002-03-27T00:00:00.000 "General US" "Man-machine Integration Design And Analysis System (MIDAS)"
     ARC-14400-1 ARC 2001-01-29T00:00:00.000 "General US" "PLOT3D Version 4.0"
     ```

### `nl` filter

The `nl` filter reads lines from files or from the `stdin`. The output is printed to `stdout`. By default, the filter `nl` counts lines in a file and uses a tab to separate the line number from the text.

Let's use `nl` with the flag `-s` to use `=` as a delimiter.
   

```bash
nl -s = NASA-software-API.txt
```

The `nl` filter has flags that allow you to change the increment value (`-i`), change the numbering format (`ln, rn, rz`), or change the starting number (`-v`).

### `wc` command

The word count command `wc` counts the number of lines, words (separated by white space), and characters in a file or from `stdin`. The output is printed to `stdout` and separated by tabs.

Use the command `wc` to see the number of lines, words, and characters in `NASA-software-API.txt`.


```bash
wc NASA-software-API.txt
```

Your output should look like this:

```output
703    8917   81115 NASA-software-API.txt
```

You can see from the output that the file has 703 lines and 8,917 and 81,115 characters. Let's check the output from the previous command, `nl`. The last printed line is:

 ```output
 700=GSC-14726-1 GSFC 2004-06-09T00:00:00.000 "Open Source" "Earth Observing System (EOS) Clearinghouse (ECHO)"
 ```

 Did you notice that the index of this line is 700 instead of 703? What's happening here?

 This index mismatch happens because, by default, the command `nl` doesn't number empty lines. Let's run the command `nl` with the option flag `-b a` to count all the lines, including the empty ones.

 ```bash
 nl -b a NASA-software-API.txt
 ```

 The last line in the output should be:

 ```output
 703  GSC-14726-1 GSFC 2004-06-09T00:00:00.000 "Open Source" "Earth Observing System (EOS) Clearinghouse (ECHO)"
 ```

 The index now matches the lines counted with the command `wc`.
