In this exercise, let's create a test spec for a Todo Application using Playwright's code generator, Codegen.
- Navigate to the Todo Application: [https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/#/](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/)
- Add a new todo item "water the plants"
- Add another todo item "feed the dog"
- Toggle the "water the plants" todo as done
- Select the active button
- Assert that the todo field contains the text "feed the dog"
- Select the completed filter
- Assert that the todo field contains the text "water the plants"
- Change the test name to active and completed filters
- Save the test file as todo.spec.ts
- Run the test with trace viewer selected and make sure it passes
