To work with processes you'll use the module `child_process`, which spawns processes. To ensure you don't block the Node.js event-loop, you want to spawn up new processes using the method `spawn()`. There is a synchronous version of this ending in `Sync`, but usually you want to avoid blocking in Node.js as much as you can.

By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are created between the parent Node.js process and the spawned child. This means you have access to the mentioned streams. You can therefore listen to events being produced by any of these streams.

## Process creation

There are four ways a process can be created

- `spawn()`,  this spawns up a new process using the given command. It takes an array of argument as the second argument and the third argument is an optional `options` object
- `exec()`, this method spawns a shell and runs the provided command within that shell, it takes a callback function that is invoked when the command completes passing the streams `stdout` and `stderr`
- `execFile()`, this executes the command directly without spawning a shell
- `fork()`, this spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a specified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows sending messages between parent and child

All of the above methods come with synchronous version that will block the event loop.

##Â Working with our child process

So what can you do with a process we spawn up?

Well, you can create a process that runs a Bash command and capture the result. Then you can listen to the emitted result and incorporate that as part of your Node.js program. Consider the below code:

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh']);
```

Here you're using the method `spawn()` from the `child_process` module and you're able to the following command to the terminal.

```bash
ls -lh
```

The above doesn't capture the output though. For that we need to listen to an event `data`. However let's first have a closer look at `ls` variable. It exposes two streams, `stdout` and `stderr`. It is on each of these streams that you'll listen to the `data` event to capture the output from your command, depending on whether it succeeded or failed. Also, listen to the `close` event so you know when the command has finished executing.

Add the following code:

```javascript
ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
});

ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
});

ls.on('close', (code) => {
  console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

This should produce output data looking like so:

```bash
-rw-r--r--  1 <user>  <group>   <size> <date> <name of app file>
```
