We will now do a quick run-down of cloud stacks that are currently popular in the market. We will quickly glance over the services offered by the major cloud providers, viz. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google as well as OpenStack, the open cloud computing platform.

##  Amazon Web Services (AWS)
As of 2015, AWS is a market leader in several cloud computing segments, particularly in the IaaS space. Amazon Web Services started by commoditizing and leasing out several services that were developed in-house by Amazon’s engineering team to the wider public. AWS started by offering S3, the object storage service, and then went on to provide EC2, the elastic compute cloud. AWS is currently one of the largest cloud computing companies.

AWS’s stack primarily consists of the following components: _Compute_: Amazon’s primary compute solution is Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which provides users with virtual machines, or instances of various capacities for hourly or longer term rentals. EC2 forms the backbone of the AWS cloud stack in terms of compute infrastructure. EC2 instances can be managed directly through the AWS EC2 APIs, or through other services such as AutoScaling. 

 _Storage_: AWS offers multiple products in this space. Block storage is provided by Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes, which can be attached and detached from EC2 instances. Object storage is provided by the simple storage service (S3), which allows for binary large objects (BLOBs) to be stored and retrieved using a simple HTTP service. AWS also offers a varied suite of database services, including RDS which offers a managed SQL service, DyanmoDB, which offers a highly scalable, low-latency key-value store, and ElastiCache, an in-memory database store. 

 _Networking_: Amazon’s Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Route 53 are networking services that can be used to manage the connectivity between your instances and services deployed in AWS and the outside world. 

 _PaaS Products_: AWS’s platforms are large and varied to cater to different application needs. AWS provides a suite of analytics platforms such as Elastic MapReduce (EMR), Amazon Kinesis and Redshift. Rapid web application development is possible through AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Amazon also offers many products to manage and control cloud deployments such as CloudFormation, OpsWorks and CodeDeploy.



##  Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure is one of the fastest growing cloud services in the market, with impressive growth and an increasingly expanding portfolio of cloud services. Azure also leverages Microsoft’s large data center presence worldwide, as well as CDN sites that are spread across 24 countries. Subsets of Microsoft’s Cloud Platform are available as the Windows Azure Pack, which _allows an organization to build a private cloud_ which can seamlessly connect and interact with the Azure public cloud. These allow internal data centers to be highly automated, using shared resources that can respond to sudden spurts in demand. 

 _Compute_: Microsoft offers Azure Virtual Machines, which can be configured to run Windows or various flavors of Linux. The virtual machines are managed by Azure Cloud Services, which provides a multi-language cloud management platform. A unique aspect of Azure is the staging environment and simulator, which allows developers to test out a cloud deployment before putting it into production. 

 _Storage_: Azure offers several storage solutions, including: Azure Blobs to store binary large objects; Azure Tables, to store NoSQL tables; and Azure Files, which offer SMB-based storage endpoints (Windows-compatible file servers) to mount and store files in the cloud. Azure also offers managed Relational Database services through the Azure SQL Database; a managed NoSQL document database service, DocumentDB; and high-performance key-value cache through Azure Redis Cache. Microsoft also offers a unique storage appliance called StorSimple, which is an SSD/HDD hybrid storage array deployed at the clients side, and also connects to Azure for backup, analytics and/or cloud deployment. 

 _Networking_: Microsoft also offers virtual private networking services through Azure Virtual Network. Another unique feature of Microsoft’s Azure cloud is the ability to purchase dedicated fiber connectivity to Microsoft’s data centers through ExpressRoute. Azure Traffic Manager can be used to load balance traffic to Azure Virtual Machines. 

 _PaaS Products_: Azure offers several PaaS products: Azure Websites is the primary PaaS platform, which enables developers to deploy scalable web applications on the Azure platform. Azure Mobile Services allow developers to create the infrastructure required to support mobile applications. In the analytics space, Azure offers several products including HDInsight, which is a managed Hadoop cluster service similar to Amazon’s EMR. Microsoft also offers managed Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services to developers. 

##  Google Cloud Platform
Google’s Cloud Platform initially offered only PaaS products and APIs into Google’s most powerful products such as the Translate API. The Google Cloud Platform has now diversified into multiple services in response to the offerings of its competitors. _Compute_: Google’s primary compute platform is the Google Compute Engine (GCE), which offers Linux virtual machines of various sizes depending on the application requirements. A unique differentiator of Google’s platform is that instances are billed by the minute, with a minimum charge of 10 minutes. 

 _Storage_: Google offers three primary storage services, namely Cloud Storage, which is an object storage service similar to S3 and Azure Blobs. Google’s Cloud Datastore is the managed NoSQL datastore service that allows users to store non-relational data with high scalability, but optionally supports transactions and SQL queries on your data. In addition, Google offers a traditional managed SQL database service called Cloud SQL. 

 _Networking_: Google offers several networking products to manage the connections between Google’s cloud services and the outside world, namely Load Balancing, Interconnect and DNS services. 

 _PaaS Products_: Google’s primary PaaS offering is Google App Engine (GAE), which allows developers to deploy an application using Google’s SDK. In addition, Google offers data analytics platforms such as BigQuery, which allows users to run SQL-like queries against multi-terabyte datasets. Cloud Endpoints allows developers to create RESTful services accessible from Mobile and browser clients. In addition, Google’s established products such as Prediction and Translate are available as APIs for access to developers to integrate into their own application. 



##  OpenStack
All of the stacks we have looked at so far are proprietary stacks hosted by the companies on their public clouds. The OpenStack model is markedly different as it’s an open-source cloud stack that is available for both public and private clouds. OpenStack defines itself as a “cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface”. OpenStack can be deployed anywhere from a bunch of machines to an entire datacenter. Public clouds that offer OpenStack include Rackspace and HP Helion. 

 _Compute_: OpenStack’s compute offering offers similar services as the public cloud counterparts, with the ability to manage virtualized and commodity server resources, with API-based access. A unique aspect of OpenStack’s compute system (called Nova) is support for a wide range of Hypervisors such as XenServer and KVM, as well as a wide range of hardware support, which includes ARM-based systems. 

 _Storage_: OpenStack offers two types of storage services: an object storage service (called Swift), as well as block storage services (called Cinder). These can be deployed and scaled according to environment and the application needs. Database systems can be deployed on top of virtual machines and storage services, if required, but OpenStack does not use or promote any particular type of database solution. Public clouds that use OpenStack, like Rackspace, offer MySQL, Percona or MariaDB deployed on top of OpenStack VMs as a service. 

 _Networking_: OpenStack offers a pluggable, scalable and API-driven system called Neutron to manage networks, VLANs and IP address pools for virtual machines. A novel feature of OpenStack networking is support for Software Defined Networks such as OpenFlow, which enable fine-grained configuration of networking hardware in response to provisioning or traffic requirements. More information on Software Defined Networks will be covered later. 

 _PaaS Products_: OpenStack itself does not have any PaaS services, but public cloud providers that are built on top of OpenStack have a few. For example, Rackspace provides several platforms for website hosting and managed Hadoop clusters.
