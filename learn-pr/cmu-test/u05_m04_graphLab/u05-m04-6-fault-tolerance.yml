  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the main difference between synchronous and asynchronous mechanisms for checkpointing in GraphLab?"
    choices:
    - content: "Synchronous checkpoints suspend the computation and flush all internal communication messages to capture the local checkpoint at every node. Asynchronous checkpoints can be run in parallel on vertices following edge consistency."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Synchronous checkpoints require computation to be suspended, while asynchronous checkpoints can be run in parallel."
    - content: "Synchronous checkpoints halt the computation and flush all internal communication messages to capture the global checkpoint of the cluster. Asynchronous checkpoints can be run in parallel on vertices following vertex consistency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Synchronous checkpoints do not require the computation to be halted completely. Asynchronous checkpoints do not follow vertex consistency."
    - content: "Synchronous checkpoints can be run in parallel on vertices following vertex consistency. Asynchronous checkpoints halt the computation and flush all internal communication messages to capture the global checkpoint of the cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
