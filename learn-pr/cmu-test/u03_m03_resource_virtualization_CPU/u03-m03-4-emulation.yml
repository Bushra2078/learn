  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements best describe(s) the above interpreter?"
    choices:
    - content: "A. This interpreter is a threaded one because it is structured around a central loop, a decoder, and a dispatcher."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A threaded interpreter is an interpreter that appends portions of the dispatch code at the end of each interpreter routine."
    - content: "B. This interpreter is a direct-and-dispatch one because it is structured around a central loop, a decoder, and a dispatcher."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not quite right. Is this the only correct answer?"
    - content: "C. In addition to the test for a halt or an interrupt at the top of the loop, this interpreter exhibits one branch."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is at least another branch for the switch statement."
    - content: "D. In addition to the test for a halt or an interrupt at the top of the loop, this interpreter exhibits three branches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In addition to a branch for the switch statement, there are other branches, such as a branch to terminate the loop, a branch to the interpreter routine, and a branch to return from the interpreter routine."
    - content: "E. In addition to the test for a halt or an interrupt at the top of the loop, this interpreter exhibits four branches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not quite right. Is this the only correct answer?"
    - content: "F.(B and E)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

  - content: "Which of the following statements best describe(s) the above interpreter?"
    choices:
    - content: "A. This interpreter is a decode-and-dispatch interpreter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Incorrect. The decode-and-dispatch interpreter is structured around a loop."
    - content: "B. This interpreter differs from a decode-and-dispatch interpreter as it appends a portion of the dispatch code to the end of each interpreter routine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Is this the only right answer?"
    - content: "C. As compared to a decode-and-dispatch interpreter, this interpreter removes three branches after calling the first interpreter routine. Thus, this interpreter performs faster than a decode-and-dispatch interpreter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Is this the only right answer?"
    - content: "D. As compared to a decode-and-dispatch interpreter, this interpreter removes all branches after calling the first interpreter routine. Thus, this interpreter performs faster than a decode-and-dispatch interpreter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is still a branch at the shaded line in the above code to jump to the next instruction in the stream."
    - content: "E. (B and C)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
