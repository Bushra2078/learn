  questions:
  - content: "Which of the above assumptions is/are most likely to break down in heterogeneous clouds but not in homogeneous ones?"
    choices:
    - content: "1"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "1 and 2"
      isCorrect: false

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "2, 3, and 5"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! In a heterogeneous cloud, different TaskTrackers may have different hardware and hence may execute tasks at different rate. In addition, tasks may progress at a different rate. Hence, tasks with low progress scores are not necessarily stragglers."
