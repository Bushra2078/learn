  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Based on Hadoop's architectural model, how are tasks assigned to slots in TaskTrackers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Push strategy: the JobTracker directly assigns tasks to individual task slots."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. TaskTrackers always report their status to the JobTracker, which assigns the individual TaskTrackers with tasks if they are free. Review how tasks are assigned to individual TaskTrackers in Hadoop."
    - content: "Pull strategy: the TaskTrackers notify the JobTracker of vacant slots and ask for tasks to be allotted to their vacant slots."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! TaskTrackers always report their status to the JobTracker, which assigns the individual TaskTrackers with tasks if they are free. This is a pull strategy."
    - content: "Push-pull strategy: the JobTracker pushes tasks to TaskTrackers without checking for vacant slots, and TaskTrackers pull tasks from the JobTracker by always requesting them."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. TaskTrackers always report their status to the JobTracker, which assigns the individual TaskTrackers with tasks if they are free. Review how tasks are assigned to individual TaskTrackers in Hadoop."
