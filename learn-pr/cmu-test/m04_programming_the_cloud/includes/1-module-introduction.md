Now that you have seen how a cloud data center runs, you may feel that all of the complexity is handled by the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), and it is trivial to build a cloud application. However, to truly fulfil the promise of the cloud, developers must design and deploy their applications following a few best practices.

In this module, we look at how applications are to be deployed on the cloud to ensure fault tolerance and achieve high performance. The global presence of cloud data centers simplifies the process of reaching many end users, but deployment patterns must support easy scaling and fault-tolerance.

A cloud application must be economical, reachable with low-latency, support a large number of simultaneous users (high throughput), without any service degradation (fault tolerance and elasticity). Despite the tools that CSPs provide, building such an application requires a lot of planning.

In the last module of Unit 2, we will look at some common patterns around load balancing and scaling, as well as how robust applications should be built.

Last, we explore some additional challenges faced by responsive, interactive applications that use a large cluster of cloud computing resources and look at some solutions.
