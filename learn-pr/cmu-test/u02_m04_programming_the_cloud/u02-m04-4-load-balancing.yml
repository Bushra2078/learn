  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Consider the following scenario: you are using AWS ELB with round-robin scheduler as a front-end to two web servers- one is a medium class instance with 2 cores and 8 GB RAM, the other is a large instance with 4 cores and 16 GB RAM. Which of the following scenarios is likely? I. Both instances will receive an equal amount of load II. Both instances will be equally utilized (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) III. The large instance will receive twice the load of the medium instance IV. The medium instance will receive twice the load of the large instance V. The large instance will have twice the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) as the medium VI. The large instance will have half the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) as the medium"
    choices:
    - content: "I and VI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!."
    - content: "III and V"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Round-robin distribution effectively alternates in sending requests to each instance behind it. Consider the mechanism that the ELB distributes load across multiple machines."
    - content: "III and VI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Round-robin distribution effectively alternates in sending requests to each instance behind it. Consider the mechanism that the ELB distributes load across multiple machines."
    - content: "II and IV"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Round-robin distribution effectively alternates in sending requests to each instance behind it. Consider the mechanism that the ELB distributes load across multiple machines."
    - content: "II and III"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Round-robin distribution effectively alternates in sending requests to each instance behind it. Consider the mechanism that the ELB distributes load across multiple machines."
