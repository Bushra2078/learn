  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you are designing a storage system for an application that extracts tables from webpages. The application plans to assign a unique identifier for each table and then store the table in the database in a raw XML-based format. What kind of system might be best suited for this type of application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Strict schema-based database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. A strict schema may impose too many restrictions on the application developer. Consider the flexiblity of each option presented. Which of them is most likely
                    to be amenable to change in the future, should the application require
                    it."
    - content: "Schema-less database (such as a key-value store)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Given the nature of the data stored, key-value stores offer increased flexibility to the application to store arbirary data indexed by key."
