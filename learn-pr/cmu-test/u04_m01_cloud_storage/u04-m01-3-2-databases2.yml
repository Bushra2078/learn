  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "A monolithic (single node) RDBMS server is used to deploy a database. Assuming that the database is always reachable and is ACID compliant, which of the CAP theorem constraints is satisfied by this server?"
    choices:
    - content: "CA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A monolithic server can be consistent and available but is not partition-tolerant, since there is only a single node."
    - content: "AP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s not quite right. Since the RDMS is ACID compliant, it must also satisfy C. A monolithic server is not partition-tolerant, since there is only a single node."
    - content: "CP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s not quite right. Since the RDMS is always reachable, it must also satisfy A. A monolithic server is not partition-tolerant, since there is only a single node."
