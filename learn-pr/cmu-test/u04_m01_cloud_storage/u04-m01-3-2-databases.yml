quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose a customer of a bank transferred $1000 into another customer's account and obtained a successful transaction message. Five minutes later, when the second customer checks their accounts, he sees that the transaction never happened and is not listed in their bank statements. Which of the ACID properties was most clearly violated in the case of this transaction?"
    choices:
    - content: "The atomicity of the transaction"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s not quite right. The transaction appeared to have happened atomically, since the customer received a successful transaction message."
    - content: "The consistency of the transaction"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s not quite right. Although the database might be inconsistent after a transaction is completed, its effects are not seen. This is more of a violation of one of the other properties."
    - content: "The isolation of the transaction"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s not quite right. The question presents no evidence to support that another transaction on this database might have affected this one."
    - content: "The durability of the transaction"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The effects of the transaction are expected to persist in the database after the transaction is committed, but the account fails to show so. Hence, there is a violation of the durability property of the transaction."
