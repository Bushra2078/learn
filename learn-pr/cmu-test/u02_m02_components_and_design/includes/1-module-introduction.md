In this module, we will discuss the various components (equipment and facilities) of a data center. We will start with a discussion on IT equipment, and will clarify many server-specific terminologies that you may have encountered. Most hardware vendors provide servers that are configurable in terms of compute, storage and networking. We will present in detail these server components. While these topics can be information-dense, the choices made while configuring servers have a major impact on the cost and performance of applications that are run on them. Therefore, an exposure to the spectrum of servers and related technologies will be useful, especially if you pursue a career that utilizes or manages cloud infrastructure.

Also, in this module, we will discuss data center facilities. Specifically, we will present some of the recent advances in power and cooling techniques which provide additional efficiency to todayâ€™s data centers. We also cover a few additional facilities-specific aspects regarding fire and safety in data centers.
