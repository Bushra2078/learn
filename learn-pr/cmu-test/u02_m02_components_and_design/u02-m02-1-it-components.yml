  questions:
  - content: "Company X is building a data center with 10 4U servers, two 5U storage arrays, and two 1U network switches in a standard-height rack. How many racks will the company need to mount all this hardware?"
    choices:
    - content: "Two racks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "One rack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because they have a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U."
    - content: "Three racks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because they have a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U."
    - content: "One-half rack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because they have a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U."
