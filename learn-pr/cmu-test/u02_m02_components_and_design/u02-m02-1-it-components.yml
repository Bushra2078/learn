  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Company X is building a data center with 10 4U servers, two 5U storage arrays, and two 1U network switches in a standard-height rack. How many racks will the company need to mount all this hardware?"
    choices:
    - content: "Two racks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!."
    - content: "One rack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because they have a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U. You have been given the size of a server in U and the total capacity of the rack in U. How do you compute the total number of servers?"
    - content: "Three racks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because they have a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U. You have been given the size of a server in U and the total capacity of the rack in U. How do you compute the total number of servers?"
    - content: "One-half rack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because they have a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U. You have been given the size of a server in U and the total capacity of the rack in U. How do you compute the total number of servers?"

  - content: "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of Infiniband networking?"
    choices:
    - content: "End-to-end latencies of less than 2 microseconds"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Infiniband networks have low end-to-end latencies. Consider the typical applications of Infiniband networks. What makes them different from other networking systems?"
    - content: "Fully nonblocking switches"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Infiniband switches are fully nonblocking. Consider the typical applications of Infiniband networks. What makes them different from other networking systems?"
    - content: "Speeds ranging from 8 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Infiniband switches range from 8 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s. Consider the typical applications of Infiniband networks. What makes them different from other networking systems?"
    - content: "Higher end-to-end latency than Ethernet"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Infiniband networks have low end-to-end latencies."
