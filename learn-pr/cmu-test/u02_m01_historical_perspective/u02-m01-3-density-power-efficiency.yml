  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Let us consider a data center for organization X spans about 5000 square feet. Based on the average power density of data centers in 2010 (Figure 2.5), and assuming the entire area is populated with IT equipment, what is the approximate power consumption of the entire data center?"
    choices:
    - content: "2.5MW"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The average watts per square foot in 2010 was approximately 500W. The total power consumption of the data center is 500 Ã— 5000 = 2,500,000W = 2.5MW."
    - content: "250kW"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The average watts per square foot in 2010 was approximately 500W. One megawatt = 1,000,000W. Can you do the math?. Think about how you can compute total power consumption given area and power density."
    - content: "1.5MW"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The average watts per square foot in 2010 was approximately 500W. One megawatt = 1,000,000W. Can you do the math?. Think about how you can compute total power consumption given area and power density."
    - content: "150kW"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The average watts per square foot in 2010 was approximately 500 W. One megawatt = 1,000,000W. Can you do the math?. Think about how you can compute total power consumption given area and power density."

  - content: "Which of the following techniques are *NOT* effective in improving the power efficiency of data centers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hot-aisle containment and in-row cooling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The retro encabulator is a fictional machine and hence NOT effective in improving the power efficiency of data centers!. Consider each of the options individually. Google them if needed."
    - content: "Server consolidation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The retro encabulator is a fictional machine and hence NOT effective in improving the power efficiency of data centers!. Consider each of the options individually. Google them if needed."
    - content: "Retro encabulator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The retro encabulator is a fictional machine!."
    - content: "High-voltage, direct current feeds to servers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The retro encabulator is a fictional machine and hence NOT effective in improving the power efficiency of data centers!. Consider each of the options individually. Google them if needed."
