In this unit we will present and discuss the data center which is a collection of physical computing resources that are provisioned and shared within the cloud computing paradigm. Innovations in data center efficiency and management are important enablers of the economics behind the cloud computing model. Recall in the previous unit, we discussed some of the benefits of cloud computing as well as the economics behind it. Major advances in data center design play a fundamental role in being able to make this possible. Large-scale data centers can house and run infrastructure more efficiently at scale than what most organizations can manage at small scale with their own infrastructure. Understanding data centers will enable you to be more informed, in terms of performance, cost and potential sources of failure, as you attempt to deploy robust applications and services on the cloud.

This module will serve as a starting step in understanding a few data center fundamentals. We will start with the definition and origins of a data center, followed by a discussion of the current trends in data center technologies: namely the increase in power and resource densities of data centers, as well as the focus on power and efficiency in data centers.
