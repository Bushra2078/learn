  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which checkpoints at P and Q form a recovery line with which processes P and Q can roll back to?"
    choices:
    - content: "P3 and Q2"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! There are no messages sent between P and Q in between checkpoints P3 and Q2; hence, the checkpoint leads to a consistent state from which the system can recover."
    - content: "P1 and Q1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q; therefore, a recovery line cannot be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
    - content: "P5 and Q3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q; therefore, a recovery line cannot be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
    - content: "P2 and Q2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q; therefore, a recovery line cannot be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
