  questions:
  - content: "What will be the result?"
    choices:
    - content: "A will have $140 and B will have $60."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The presence of locks guarantees that the result will never be inconsistent."
    - content: "A will have $60 and B will have $90."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The presence of locks guarantees that the result will never be inconsistent."
    - content: "A will have $110 and B will have $90."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The presence of locks guarantees that the result will never be inconsistent."
    - content: "The transactions will never complete due to a deadlock."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The simultaneous acquisition of locks on both A and B by two separate transactions will lead to a deadlock because transaction 1 will fail to acquire the second lock on account B, and transaction 2 will fail to acquire the second lock on account A. At least one of them have to release the lock and start over for the transactions to proceed."
