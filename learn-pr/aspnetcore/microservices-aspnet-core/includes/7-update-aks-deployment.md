In this unit, you run a script to deploy the coupon service and other configuration changes to the existing app. You then verify that the changes were successful. 

## Deploy changes

Run the following script in the command shell to update the existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with the new configuration:

```bash
./deploy/k8s/update-aks.sh
```

The preceding script uses `helm` commands to:

* Uninstall the *:::no-loc text="WebStatus":::*, *:::no-loc text="WebSPA":::*, and aggregator Helm charts from the AKS deployment.
* Install the reconfigured *:::no-loc text="WebStatus":::* and aggregator Helm charts by using a public container registry.
* Install the new *:::no-loc text="Coupon.API":::* chart and the reconfigured *:::no-loc text="WebSPA":::* chart by using your private Azure Container Registry.

The `helm uninstall` and `helm install` commands used by the script are shown in the command shell with the correct parameters.

## Verify changes

1. Go to the *:::no-loc text="WebStatus":::* page. Observe the status of the changed services.
