Suppose you work for an online retailer. The retailer uses a microservices-based architecture developed using .NET Core for its online storefront. You are asked to implement a coupon feature. This module walks through the addition of a single microservice to the existing app, followed by deploying the updated app.

You'll use your Azure subscription to deploy the resources in this module. To estimate the expected costs for these resources, see the [preconfigured Azure Calculator estimate](https://aka.ms/microservices-aspnet-core-estimate?azure-portal=true) of the resources that you'll deploy.

> [!WARNING]
> Be sure to deprovision your Azure resources when you are done with this module to avoid unnecessary charges to your Azure subscription.

* Examine an existing ASP.NET Core microservice running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
* Create an ASP.NET Core microservice.
* Deploy the microservice to the existing application in AKS.
