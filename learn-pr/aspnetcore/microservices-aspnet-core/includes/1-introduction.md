Imagine you're a software developer for an online retailer named *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::*. The retailer uses a microservices-based architecture that's native to the cloud. It uses .NET Core for its online storefront. A new project is underway to add support for accepting coupon codes at checkout. Your assignment on the project is to finish writing a containerized ASP.NET Core web API to manage coupon codes. This web API is referred to as the *coupon service*.

This module explores completing the coupon service, adding it to the existing solution, and deploying it to the multi-container Kubernetes cluster.
