Imagine you're a software developer for an online retailer named *eShopOnContainers*. The retailer uses a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture developed using .NET Core for its online storefront. A new project is underway to add support for accepting coupon codes at checkout. Your assignment on the project is to finish writing a containerized ASP.NET Core web API to manage coupon codes&mdash;a web API that will be referred to as the coupon service.

This module explores completing the coupon service, adding it to the existing solution, and deploying it to the multi-container Kubernetes cluster. You'll use your own Azure subscription to deploy the resources in this module. To estimate the expected costs for these resources, see the [preconfigured Azure Calculator estimate](https://aka.ms/microservices-aspnet-core-estimate?azure-portal=true) of the resources that you'll deploy. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/?azure-portal=true) before you begin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This module uses your own Azure subscription.** To avoid unnecessary charges in your Azure subscription, remember to deprovision your Azure resources when you're done with this module.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Examine existing ASP.NET Core microservices running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
* Implement a new ASP.NET Core microservice and containerize it.
* Publish the Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
* Deploy the Docker container to the existing AKS cluster.

## Prerequisites

* Experience writing C# at the beginner level
* Familiarity with RESTful service concepts and HTTP action verbs, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* Conceptual knowledge of containers at the beginner level
* Access to an Azure subscription
