In this unit, you'll deploy the eShop app to AKS. You'll also gain an understanding of the microservices architecture used.

## Set up development environment

Run the following command in the command shell. Be patient, as setup can take a few minutes to complete.

```bash
. <(wget -q -O - https://aka.ms/microservices-aspnet-core-setup)
```

[!INCLUDE[OS-specific keyboard shortcuts](../../../includes/azure-cloudshell-copy-paste-tip.md)]

The preceding command retrieves and runs a setup script from a GitHub repository. The script completes the following steps:

* Clones the eShop project from a GitHub repository.
* Builds the ASP.NET Core starter code.
* Provisions an AKS and Azure Container Registry (ACR) resource.
* Sets environment variables that are required for this module.
* Displays connection information for the Azure resources.
* Launches the Cloud Shell Editor to view the code.
