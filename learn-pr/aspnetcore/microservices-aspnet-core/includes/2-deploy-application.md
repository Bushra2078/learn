In this unit, you'll use a script to deploy the existing *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* app to AKS.

[!INCLUDE[Azure Cloud Shell instructions](../../includes/use-az-cloud-shell.md)]

## Run deployment script

Run the following command in the command shell:

```bash
. <(wget -q -O - https://aka.ms/microservices-aspnet-core-setup)
```

[!INCLUDE[OS-specific keyboard shortcuts](../../../includes/azure-cloudshell-copy-paste-tip.md)]

The preceding command retrieves and runs a setup script from a GitHub repository. The script completes the following steps:

* Installs the required version of the .NET Core SDK.
* Clones the *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* app from a GitHub repository.
* Provisions AKS and ACR resources.
* Launches the Cloud Shell editor to view the code.
* Deploys the containers to a fully managed Kubernetes service in Azure, known as AKS.
* Displays connection information upon completion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The script installs the required version of the .NET Core SDK alongside the version pre-installed in Azure Cloud Shell. To revert to the default configuration in Cloud Shell, see the instructions in the **Summary** unit.

The script deploys a modified version of the *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* [reference app](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eshoponcontainers). While the script is running, continue to the next unit to review the *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* architecture.

> [!NOTE]
> Non-blocking warnings are expected in the deployment process. If an unexpected exception occurs, you may reset any changes made by the script by executing the following command:
>
> ```azurecli
> cd ~ && \
>   rm -rf ~/clouddrive/aspnet-learn && \
>   az group delete --name eshop-learn-rg --yes
> ```
