In this unit, you'll use a script to deploy the existing *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* app to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Open the development environment

1. clone
1. open in container from VS Code

### or 

1. Codespace

## Run deployment script

Run the following command in the command shell:

```bash
# todo: new script
```

The preceding command retrieves and runs a setup script from a GitHub repository. The script completes the following steps:

* Provisions AKS and Azure Container Registry resources.
* Launches the Cloud Shell editor to view the code.
* Deploys the containers to a fully managed Kubernetes service in Azure, known as AKS.
* Displays connection information upon completion.

The script deploys a modified version of the *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* [reference app](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eshoponcontainers). While the script is running, continue to the next unit to review the *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* architecture.
