Now that you have added a *:::no-loc text="Create":::* Razor Page form and its *:::no-loc text="PageModel":::* class file that handles HTTP POST events, it's time to test and run the completed project.

## Build, deploy, and test the updated *:::no-loc text="ContosoPets.Ui":::* project

### Build your *:::no-loc text="ContosoPets.Ui":::* app

1. Run the following command in the command shell to return to the project directory:

    ```bash
    popd
    ```

    The current directory should now be the *:::no-loc text="ContosoPets.Ui":::* directory.

1. Run the following command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet build
    ```

    The preceding command rebuilds your *:::no-loc text="ContosoPets.Ui":::* app with your latest saved changes.

### Deploy your app to a public endpoint hosted on Azure App Service

Run the following command in the command shell:

```azurecli
az webapp up
```

The preceding command runs a script to provision a public endpoint for this project. Be patient, as it may take several minutes.

Something like the following text should eventually display to indicate the web API is being deployed.

```console
Starting zip deployment. This operation can take a while to complete...
```

Once your project has been successfully hosted. You should see something like the following text:

```console
You can launch the app at http://webapp<random ID number here>.azurewebsites.net
```

Now that your finished *:::no-loc text="ContosoPets.Ui":::* app is hosted on a public endpoint, let's test the new *:::no-loc text="Create":::* Razor Page.

## Tour the web pages generated by the running app

1. Run the following command in the command shell to get the hosted app's URL:

   ```bash
   echo $webAppUrl
   ```

1. Select the resulting URL in the command shell to view the running web app in your local default browser.

1. Select the **:::no-loc text="Products Admin":::** link.

1. Select the **:::no-loc text="Add Product":::** link.

   Your new *:::no-loc text="Create":::* Razor Page displays.

1. Leave the **:::no-loc text="Name":::** text box empty. Enter `0` in the **:::no-loc text="Price":::** text box. Select the **:::no-loc text="Save":::** button.

   Server-side validation occurs. Validation messages appear next to the text boxes because the provided values are invalid.

1. Enter any product name in the **:::no-loc text="Name":::** text box. Enter `30` in the **:::no-loc text="Price":::** text box. Select the **:::no-loc text="Save":::** button.

   If the form fields passed input validation, and the web API accepted the new data, you're returned to the products page that should now include your new product entry in the list.

1. When you're finished testing your app, close the browser. In the command shell, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to stop the app.
