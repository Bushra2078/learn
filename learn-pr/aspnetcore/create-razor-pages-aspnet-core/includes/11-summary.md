In this module you walked through the Razor Pages related architecture of a very basic ASP.NET Core application designed as a UI client. This application provided a UI for updating and deleting product listings exposed through a web API endpoint. You created a new Razor Page form, taking advantage of Razor Helper Tags to quickly add client-side and server-side validation, as well as cross-site antiforgery validation. You coded its PageModel class file which provided a seperation of concern for the page's logic operations and data properties. You walked through the code of the HTTP client you injected into your Razor PageModel class. You injected the HTTP client as a service by using ASP.NET Core's supported Dependency Injection pattern.
