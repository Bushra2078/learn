In this module, you'll create a cross-platform ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app with .NET and C#.

This module uses the [.NET Core CLI](/dotnet/core/tools/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Windows, Linux, and macOS) to demonstrate ASP.NET Core Razor Pages development. After completing this module, you can apply its concepts using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS), or Visual Studio Code.
