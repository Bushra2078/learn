Imagine your company or an affiliate has product data available through a web API. You want to quickly create a front-end web application that will allow your team to view, create, update, and delete that data exposed from the web API endpoint. Your application also needs to be structured in a way that you can continue to expand and build on it, keeping View and Data model concerns separate.

In this module, you'll build a cross-platform ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web application with .NET Core and C#. The web application will call an example pre-made web API to retrieve data it will display, allow the user to manipulate, and update to the web API endpoint.

This module uses the [.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/) to demonstrate ASP.NET Core Razor Pages development. After completing this module, you can apply its concepts using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS), or Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, & macOS).

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Understand when and why to use Razor Pages for your ASP.NET Core application.
* Use the .NET Core CLI to create a new Razor page and its paired C# PageModel class file.
* Complete the projects Create, Read Update and Delete (CRUD) operations by adding a *Create* form using Razor syntax.
* Add built-in client-side form input validation using Razor's Input Tag Helper.
* Add built-in server-side model validation using *Data Annotations*.
* Add a reference to a Data Transfer Object (DTO).
* Consume a RESTful service from your PageModel.
* Walk through the life cycle of an example HTTP request.
* Deploy & Test.

At the end of this module there are links to content providing deeper dives for each feature area introduced.

## Prerequisites

* Experience writing C# at the beginner level.
* Familiarity with RESTful service concepts and HTTP action verbs, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
* Knowledge of HTML.
