In this module, you examined the Razor Pages architecture of a basic ASP.NET Core app. This app provided a UI for updating and deleting product listings exposed through a web API endpoint. You added a product creation form, taking advantage of Razor Tag Helpers. With Tag Helpers, you quickly added client-side and server-side validation. You also gained cross-site antiforgery validation. You coded its `PageModel` class that provided a separation of concern for the page's logic operations and data properties. You reviewed the code of the HTTP client you injected into your `PageModel` class. You injected the HTTP client as a service by using ASP.NET Core's native DI system. Finally, the app was deployed to and tested in Azure App Service.
