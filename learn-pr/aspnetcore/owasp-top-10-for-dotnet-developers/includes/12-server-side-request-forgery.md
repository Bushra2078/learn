This category (SSRF) describes situations whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination.

Attacker may also use this functionality to import untrusted data into code that expects to only read data from trusted sources, and as such circumvent input validation.
URL, or query string, seen in web browser's address bar, when used as input parameter could be a perfect example of user input needing sanitization.

During code review, you came across seemingly harmless REST web GET request shown in code snippet:

```csharp
string url = Request.Form["url"];
var client = new HttpClient();
HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(url);
```

Without validation of the supplied URL the attacker can hijack the network connection and control the request schema by supplying **ldap://**, **jar://** or **file://** instead of **https://**. Furthermore, POST method allows the attacker to force the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination.

In certain situations, with carefully formulated URL, the attacker may be able to:

- read server configuration such as metadata,
- connect to internal services like http enabled databases,
- perform POST requests to an internal service, which aren't intended to be exposed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> User-controlled data should not be trusted. Validate all input to  and ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

An allow list or blocklist should be enforced (like IP addresses and host names).

Correct user input validation can protect your application from a few OWASP Top 10 items.

### Code Review Notes

Once again you were reminded of the importance of input validation. Luckily, .NET has built-in [IPAddress.TryParse](/dotnet/api/system.net.ipaddress.tryparse) or [Uri.CheckHostName](/dotnet/api/system.uri.checkhostname) methods for input and configuration validation.

To summarize, prevention from SSRF attacks in your .NET applications may involve:

- validation of user input and only allowing expected values,
- use of allow list with approved domains and protocols for network communication.
