<!-- ## A05: Security Misconfiguration -->

Highly configurable and distributed software, along with supporting services and tooling, introduces complexity. Example of an eterprise application with supporting DevOps process can be seen on the image below. Here, security misconfiguration can apply to how you protect developer workstations, handle app secrets in your application, protect the CI/CD process etc.

The application might be vulnerable if the application is without a rigorous repeatable application security configuration process.

Security misconfiguration can manifest itself in many places, from `web.config` or `appsettings.json` settings, database account and connectivity configuration, IIS configurations to CI/CD pipeline secret handling or incorrect Azure Role Base Access Control use.

The example above demonstrates one of many native integrations between Azure DevOps and Azure Cloud where Azure DevOps Library is linked with Azure KeyVault to securely access secret pipeline parameters.
Secret values should never be found in codebase. The same practice applies to infrastructure as code (IaC) release workflows and CI/CD services themselves.
