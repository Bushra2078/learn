The objectives of the module was to explain:

* what OWASP as an non-profit organization goals are
* what OWASP Top 10 is
* how can it be used as a reference in writing more secure code.

We started by explaining  the threat landscape and complexity associated with modern day application security. Going one by one through the recently updated list OWASP Top 10 equipped us in methods and techniques used by malicious actors to compromise an app and more importantly how we, as authors and maintainers of any side codebase, can improve it's security posture.

No matter if you are  designing a brand new green field application or contributing to large-scale open source project best security principles apply. Shift security left and conduct security requirement and design reviews, perform threat modeling, use automation to scan for vulnerabilities as you write code (with static code analysis tools) and as part of the CI/CD process. Follow compartmentalization best practices zero trust and least-privilege principles.

        Track threat actor activity and patterns with Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence. Security operations teams can uncover attacker infrastructure and accelerate investigation and remediation with more context, insights, and analysis than ever before. While threat intelligence is already built into the real-time detections of our platform and security products like the Microsoft Defender family and Microsoft Sentinel, this new offering provides direct access to real-time data from Microsoft’s unmatched security signals. Organizations can proactively hunt for threats more broadly in their environments, empower custom threat intelligence processes and investigations, and improve the performance of third-party security products.

        See your business the way an attacker can with Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management. The new Defender External Attack Surface Management gives security teams the ability to discover unknown and unmanaged resources that are visible and accessible from the internet—essentially the same view an attacker has when selecting a target. Defender External Attack Surface Management helps customers discover unmanaged resources that could be potential entry points for an attacker.

        Weather with Azure DevOps or GitHub Advanced Security remember to

        * Shift security left by automatically finding vulnerabilities early in your development workflows
        * Ensure the security and compliance of your open source components
        * Bring the expertise of top security researchers to your software projects
