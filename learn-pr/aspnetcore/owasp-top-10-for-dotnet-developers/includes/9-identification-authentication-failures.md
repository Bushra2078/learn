## A07 - Identification and Authentication Failures

Authentication is a process in which a user provides credentials that are then compared to those stored in an operating system, database, app or resource. If they match, users authenticate successfully, and can then perform actions that they're authorized for, during an authorization process. The authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is allowed to do.

Confirmation of the user’s identity, authentication and session management is critical to protect against authentication–related attacks.

Cross site request forgery, session hijacking or brute force credential stuffing are just a few techniques used by attachers to exploit broken authentication. The result may be temporal or permanent information disclosure or account hijacking.

> [!TIP]
> Follow [Security Development Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl/practices) and [Operational Security](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/osa/practices) best practices to ensure Multi-Factor Authentication, Zero Trust and established Design Requirements are in place.

Operations related to user's identity, authentication or session management should be adequately protected and implemented correctly. Avoid security through obscurity.

Luckily [ASP.NET](/aspnet/core/security) Core and EF contain features that help you secure your apps and prevent security breaches. For example, ASP.NET MVC framework has a build-in helper methods which can add anti-forgery tokens to your Razor pages:

``` razor
@using (Html.BeginForm("Manage", "Account")) {
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
}
```

XSS works by tricking your application into inserting a `<script>` tag into your rendered page, or by inserting an On* event into an element.
Never put untrusted data into your HTML input. Untrusted data is any data that may be controlled by an attacker, HTML form inputs, query strings, HTTP headers, even data sourced from a database as an attacker may be able to breach your database even if they cannot breach your application.

Before putting untrusted data inside an HTML element ensure it's HTML encoded. HTML encoding takes characters such as `<` and changes them into a safe form like `&lt`;

Before putting untrusted data into a URL query string ensure it's URL encoded. Don't make authorization decisions based on the state of the UI but only from component state. Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to protect against XSS attacks. Consider using CSP and X-Frame-Options to protect against click-jacking. Ensure CORS settings are appropriate when enabling CORS or explicitly disable CORS for Blazor apps.

> The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) enables developers to acquire security tokens from the Microsoft identity platform to authenticate users and access secured web APIs. It can be used to provide secure access to > Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIs, third-party web APIs, or your own web API. MSAL supports many different application architectures and platforms including .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, Android, and iOS.
