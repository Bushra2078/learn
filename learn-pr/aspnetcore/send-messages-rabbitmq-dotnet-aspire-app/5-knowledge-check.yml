  questions:
  - content: "You're setting up a RabbitMQ message channel. You want to distribute all messages to all the subscribers without any filters. What kind of exchange should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Direct"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A direct exchange applies filters to messages so you can govern which queues and consumers receive them."
    - content: "Topic"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A topic exchange applies filters with wildcards to messages so you can flexibly govern with queues and consumers receive them."
    - content: "Fanout"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you use a fanout exchange, messages are copied to all the subscribers."
  - content: "You've added a RabbitMQ container in your AppHost project and passed it to a consuming project. In the consumer, how can you obtain a connection to the RabbitMQ service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call the AddRabbitMQ() method and then use dependency injection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Once you've called the AddRabbitMQ() method you can get the connection that the AppHost passed to your consuming project by using dependency injection in the object where you want to send or receive messages."
    - content: "Call the AddRabbitMQContainer() method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You use the AddRabbitMQContainer() method in the AppHost to create a RabbitMQ service, not in the consuming project."
    - content: "Call the CreateModel() method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You use the CreateModel() method to set up a messaging channel after you have obtained the connection."
