Building a web API is a common task. You want to be able to serve some data and how an application, or service, consume it. How you build the API may differ vastly between tech stacks. As part of building an API, you know there are many parts to it like data storage, security, versioning, documentation and more. Getting all of these parts to work can be a complex undertaking. 

## Scenario: building a prototype

You are a developer on a team. As part of your job, you are building and maintaining many APIs. You also experiment a bit with new technologies to see if it's a good fit for your company's needs. You like frameworks that allow you to create an API with just a few lines of code as it gives you an early result and makes for a good conversation with colleagues and other stakeholders. You assume that you can add more features later as the API grows in complexity.

## What will you learn?

You will learn to build a so-called minimal API using ASP.NET Core and .NET 6. As part of building your API, you will add various route constructs to handle the reading and writing of data. Additionally, you will add Swagger to ensure you have a way of documenting your API.

## What is the main goal?

Build a powerful API supporting reading and writing with just a few lines of code.
