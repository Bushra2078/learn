In this module, you've learned to create an API using the minimal API template for .NET 6.

Minimal API enables you to create an API with just a few lines of code. It has all the major features that you are used to like Dependency Injection, talking to databases, route management and more. It differs from a controller-based API in that you need to explicitly specify the routes you need over relying on a convention-based approach like with controller-based API.

There's many benefits to this approach:

- **Easier to get started**. With four lines of code, you have an API up and running.
- **Progressive enhancement**. Add the features when you need it, and until then your program code stays small.
- **.NET 6 latest features**. Using all the latest features from .NET 6 like top-level statements, records and more.

As part of this module, you also learned to add Swagger and adding a complete CRUD, routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting a resource.
