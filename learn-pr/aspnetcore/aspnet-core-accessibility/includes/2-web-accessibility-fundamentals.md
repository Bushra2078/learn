The world wide web is an amazing place, and it's best when everyone can participate. The first step to building accessible web applications is a basic awareness of the diverse ways that users interact with our web applications.

## The importance of inclusive design

When you're developing web applications, it's easy to get into a workflow of writing some code, testing it in a browser, fixing bugs, repeat, repeat, repeat. Unfortunately, this approach leads to web applications that don't work for everyone.

There are a lot of good reasons to consider accessibility in your web applications:

- A good percentage of your potential users may have one or more impairments that require them to interact differently with your web application. Improving accessibility increases your potential user base.
- Web applications are now under a number of legal requirements which require web accessibility standards compliance. Failure to incorporate accessibility into your development methodology can result in legal and financial penalties.
- Accessibility is a human rights issue. Helping others to gain full access to the internet is just the right, and nice, thing to do.

## We don't all browse the same way

While we, as an industry, often focus only on conventional browser-based interaction, many users access our applications in different ways.

### Screen readers

One of the best-known accessibility tools is a screen reader. Screen readers are commonly used clients for people with vision impairments. They're built into most operating systems.

At its most basic, a screen reader reads a page from top to bottom audibly. If your page is all text, the reader conveys the information in a similar way to a browser. Of course, webpages are rarely purely text; they contain links, graphics, color, and other visual components. Care must be taken to ensure that a screen reader can correctly read this information.

### Visual impairments

Visual ability is a spectrum. Whereas some users require, or prefer, an auditory experience, many will prefer a visual experiences but may encounter issues with small text, contrast, or colorblindness.

### Input devices

We commonly consider keyboard, mouse, and mobile touchscreen interactions in our web applications. However, this is just scratching the surface of the way users interact with their computers and our web applications. Some additional modes include ergonomic keyboards, chording keyboards, voice interaction, eye tracking, and head tracking.

## The web is an accessible platform

The above information may seem a little daunting. Fortunately, we've got some good news: HTML and web standards were designed for accessibility. In many cases, when you follow web standards, your web applications will "just work" in various accessibility scenarios, or require minor modification.

The ASP.NET Core templates are built with Bootstrap, which was designed with accessibility in mind, as it considers responsive design, structural markup, and color contrast. While it's not automatic accessibility, it can help get you started.

## Accessibility Insights for Web intro

In this module, we'll be using the Accessibility Insights, an extension for Chrome and the new Microsoft Edge that helps developers find and fix accessibility issues in web apps and sites.
