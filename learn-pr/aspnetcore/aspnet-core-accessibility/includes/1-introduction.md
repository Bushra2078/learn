There are several concepts, syntax, and elements to be aware of to make your web pages accessible for people of all abilities. By following these principles, ASP.NET Core developers can improve the accessibility of their web applications in several ways.

## Example scenario

Suppose your team has been hired to build a web application for a pizza restaurant using ASP.NET Core. The specifications for the app were already created by a graphic designer, and a colleague has already implemented the basic functionality. However, the client has asked you to review the site to ensure it is broadly accessible.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll first create a new ASP.NET Core web application and observe some problems, which affect its accessibility. You'll install tools to diagnose accessibility issues, and the fix issues with forms and visual accessibility. Finally, you will use your screen reader to understand how accessibility issues can impact the screen reader experience, and further improve your application to allow for screen reader-based navigation.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to diagnose and fix accessibility issues in an ASP.NET Core web application. You will also learn how to avoid common mistakes, so you can design and build web applications with accessibility in mind.
