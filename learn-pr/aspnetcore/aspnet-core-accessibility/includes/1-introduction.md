There are several concepts, syntax, and elements to be aware of to make your web pages accessible for people of all abilities. By folowing these principles, ASP.NET Core developers can improve the accessibility of their web applications in several ways.

## Example scenario

Suppose you've been hired to build a web application using ASP.NET Core. The specifications for the app were already created by a graphic designer. They include some elements that don't automatically provide hints for screen readers, such as images and entries. To ensure that our app is accessible to every user, we will extend these controls with accessibility features that ASP.NET Core and web accessibility standards provide.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll first enable your system's screen reader and navigation assistance tools so you can get a feel for how they work. Then, you'll create a new ASP.NET Core web application and test improve its accessibility. You'll be able to use your screen reader to hear the speech generated by the automation properties and intelligently navigate your app's controls with touch gestures on the touchscreen or by using a keyboard.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to add text-to-speech screen reader features and control the order in which the on-screen elements are read, improving the accessibility of your ASP.NET Core web application.
