You needed to create a ASP.NET Core app that is accessible to users. ASP.NET Core automation properties and intentional content ordering enabled you to enhance applications to make them more accessible.

In this module, you used ASP.NET Core automation properties to control what elements are included and what information is read back by the screen reader. You also applied intentional content ordering to improve the screen reader and keyboard experience of ASP.NET Core apps. 

There are many more enhancements to applications that can be made to improve accessibility including better layout and design of user interface elements, appropriate font sizes, and suitable color and contrast settings. For guidelines on more areas to consider, see the [Accessibility Checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/accessibility#accessibility-checklist).
