Logging and monitoring have always been very important to ensure the application health and troubleshooting issues, but in a microservices application they can easily become critical, because of the sheer amount of components and "moving parts" involved.

In this module we'll focus on diagnostic logs and performance monitoring in eShopOnContainers.

In this module you will:

- Deploy an initial version of eShopOnContainers to an AKS cluster in your subscription.
- Review some important logging concepts and samples of the logging infrastructure already implemented in eShopOnContainers.
- Add Application Insights logging.
- Implement some basic application monitoring features with Application Insights.
- Enable Azure Monitor for containers in your AKS cluster.
- Implement a custom metric using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) endpoints to monitor on the Azure Portal using Azure Monitor for containers.

## Learning objectives

- Understand the key concepts of logging.
- Explore the included logs in eShopOnContainers.
- Learn how to implement Application Insights logging and monitoring.
- Learn how to create a custom metric using the Prometheus SDK.
- Learn how to enable Azure Monitor for containers in an AKS cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with REST API services
- Familiarity with web development
- Access to an Azure subscription with **Owner** privilege
