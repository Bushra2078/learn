  questions:
    - content: Which of the following is **NOT** true regarding logging and monitoring?
      choices:
        - content: Diagnostic logging is a key factor for troubleshooting issues in production.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Logs have text-based records of events collected while the app is running. The diagnostic information helps troubleshoot issues when the app doesn't behave as expected."
        - content: The purpose of application monitoring is tracking key business performance indicators.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Application monitoring refers to gathering application metrics that are meant to track the application health."
        - content: Correlation Id establishes a link between two or more contexts or applications.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Every incoming request is assigned a unique Id so you can trace and correlate a set of events across the boundaries of the applications"
        - content: Structured logging allows you to get more information from your log traces than regular plain text logging.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Structured logging enables us to add custom log context. This additional information gives us the context that we need to understand and work with the event entirely."
    - content: Which of the following is **true** for Application Insights?
      choices:
        - content: You have to create one Application Insights resource (instrumentation key) per service type.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The instrumentation key determines the destination of the telemetry. Each microservice defines its own Azure Application Insights resource."
        - content: Application Map can be used to investigate failures and performance issues across services and dependencies. 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Application Map helps you spot performance bottlenecks or failure hotspots across all components of your distributed application."
        - content: Application Insights provides built-in correlation and dependency tracking 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Application Insights SDK automatically injects correlation context into HTTP headers, and includes the correlation ID in Application Insights logs."
        - content: All of the above.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor, is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for developers.  It's designed to help you continuously improve performance and usability."          
    - content: Which of the following is **NOT** true regarding Azure Monitor for containers?
      choices:
        - content: Azure Monitor for containers gives you infrastructure-oriented metrics.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Monitor collects memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers via the Kubernetes metrics API."
        - content: You have to additionally install Prometheus server to monitor Prometheus-endpoint metrics in AKS.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Prometheus server isn't required. You just need to expose the Prometheus metrics endpoint through your exporters or pods (app), and the containerized agent for Azure Monitor for containers can scrape the metrics for you."
        - content: Using a Kusto query, you can retrieve the Prometheus performance metric data from Azure Portal
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You can execute a custom Kusto query from the Logs option in the Monitoring section of your AKS resource."
        - content: Azure Monitor for Containers can scrape metrics from Prometheus-based metrics endpoints.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Monitor for containers provides a seamless onboarding experience to collect Prometheus metrics from the configured endpoint."
