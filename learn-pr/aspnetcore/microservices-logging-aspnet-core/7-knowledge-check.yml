  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What's the primary goal when implementing a resiliency solution for an app?
      choices:
        - content: Make the app error-free.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Making an app error-free is unlikely."
        - content: Handling user errors transparently.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Users should be provided useful feedback for errors."
        - content: Handling transient infrastructure failures.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Resilience is about mitigating inevitable transient failures in an app's infrastructure."
        - content: Handling major infrastructure failures.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Major infrastructure failures generally aren't transient and require manual intervention."
    - content: Which of the following sentences is correct?
      choices:
        - content: Polly is the best option to handle failures, but it requires a significant amount of work.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Polly is one option, but the best option depends on the context. Polly requires only minor code changes."
        - content: Linkerd can be implemented with little effort, but it only handles TCP connection failures.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd can handle HTTP and SQL connections."
        - content: Polly and Linkerd can have complementary roles, depending on the context.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Polly and Linkerd take different approaches to resiliency and have complementary roles."
    - content: Which of the following components isn't needed to achieve a resilient app in Kubernetes?
      choices:
        - content: CI/CD pipelines.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines aren't required for resiliency."
        - content: Health check probes for services.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Kubernetes clusters use health checks to determine a service's state."
        - content: Failure handling code for complex database transactions.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Complex transactions should always account for failure states."
        - content: Network-related resiliency infrastructure.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Network-related resiliency is required for all networked apps."

# 1. Mark all the correct statements about logging and monitoring in microservices application:

#    - Diagnostic logging is a key factor for troubleshooting issues in production. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Application Monitoring is about keeping track of business key performance indicators.
#    - Application monitoring can help on getting some important business metrics. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Logging to the host filesystem is an acceptable solution in a microservices application.
#    - Structured logging allows you to get more information from your log traces than regular plain text logging. - **CORRECT ANSWER**

# 2. Mark the correct statements about Application Insights

#    - You have to configure all app dependencies for Application Insights to draw the application map.
#    - You have to create one Application Insights resource (instrumentation key) per service type. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Application Insights can get both aggregated and instance-specific metrics for each service. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Application Insights automatically monitors communication with with each service's external dependencies. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Application Insights can't be used to track marketing related user processes, such as conversion.

# 3. Mark the correct statements about Azure Monitor for containers

#    - Azure Monitor for containers gives you more infrastructure-oriented metrics. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Azure Monitor for containers is specifically focused on Kubernetes.
#    - You have to install Prometheus and Grafana to monitor Prometheus-endpoint metrics in AKS.
#    - Any application can publish custom metrics through a Prometheus-based metrics endpoint. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Azure Monitor for can scrape metrics from Prometheus-based metrics endpoints. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
