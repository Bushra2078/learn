  questions:
    - content: Which of the following statements is **NOT** true about logging and monitoring?
      choices:
        - content: Diagnostics logging is a key factor for troubleshooting issues in production.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Logs have text-based records of events collected while the app is running. The diagnostic information helps troubleshoot issues when the app doesn't behave as expected."
        - content: The purpose of app monitoring is to track key business performance indicators.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "App monitoring is meant to track the app's health."
        - content: A correlation ID establishes a link between two or more contexts or apps.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Each incoming request is assigned a unique ID. This ID allows you to trace and correlate a set of events across the boundaries of the apps."
        - content: Structured logging allows you to get more information from your log traces than plain-text logging.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Structured logging enables us to add custom log context. This additional information gives us the context that we need to understand and work with the event entirely."
    - content: Which of the following statements is **NOT** true for Application Insights?
      choices:
        - content: One Application Insights resource (instrumentation key) must be created per service.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The instrumentation key determines the destination of the telemetry. Each microservice defines its own Azure Application Insights resource."
        - content: Application Map can be used to investigate failures and performance issues across services and dependencies. 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Application Map helps you locate performance bottlenecks or failure hot spots across all components of your distributed app."
        - content: Application Insights provides built-in correlation and dependency tracking.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Application Insights SDK automatically injects correlation context into HTTP headers and includes the correlation ID in Application Insights logs."
        - content: Application Insights is enabled by default for all ASP.NET Core apps running on AKS.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "To enable Application Insights in an ASP.NET Core app, add `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore` NuGet package and configure it."          
    - content: Which of the following statements is **NOT** true about Azure Monitor for Containers?
      choices:
        - content: Azure Monitor for Containers gives you infrastructure-oriented metrics.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Monitor collects memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers via the Kubernetes metrics API."
        - content: A Prometheus server must be installed to monitor Prometheus endpoint metrics in AKS.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "A Prometheus server isn't required. You just need to expose the Prometheus metrics endpoint through your exporters or pods (app), and the containerized agent for Azure Monitor for Containers can scrape the metrics for you."
        - content: Using a Kusto query, you can retrieve the Prometheus performance metric data from the Azure portal.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You can execute a custom Kusto query from the **Logs** panel in the **Monitoring** section of your AKS resource."
        - content: Azure Monitor for Containers can scrape metrics from Prometheus-based metrics endpoints.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Monitor for Containers provides a seamless onboarding experience to collect Prometheus metrics from the configured endpoint."
