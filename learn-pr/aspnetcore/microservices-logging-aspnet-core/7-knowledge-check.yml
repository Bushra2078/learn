  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What's the primary goal when implementing a resiliency solution for an app?
      choices:
        - content: Make the app error-free.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Making an app error-free is unlikely."
        - content: Handling user errors transparently.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Users should be provided useful feedback for errors."
        - content: Handling transient infrastructure failures.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Resilience is about mitigating inevitable transient failures in an app's infrastructure."
        - content: Handling major infrastructure failures.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Major infrastructure failures generally aren't transient and require manual intervention."
    - content: Which of the following sentences is correct?
      choices:
        - content: Polly is the best option to handle failures, but it requires a significant amount of work.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Polly is one option, but the best option depends on the context. Polly requires only minor code changes."
        - content: Linkerd can be implemented with little effort, but it only handles TCP connection failures.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd can handle HTTP and SQL connections."
        - content: Polly and Linkerd can have complementary roles, depending on the context.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Polly and Linkerd take different approaches to resiliency and have complementary roles."
    - content: Which of the following components isn't needed to achieve a resilient app in Kubernetes?
      choices:
        - content: CI/CD pipelines.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines aren't required for resiliency."
        - content: Health check probes for services.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Kubernetes clusters use health checks to determine a service's state."
        - content: Failure handling code for complex database transactions.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Complex transactions should always account for failure states."
        - content: Network-related resiliency infrastructure.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Network-related resiliency is required for all networked apps."

# 1. Which of the following is **NOT** true regarding logging and monitoring
#    - Diagnostic logging is a key factor for troubleshooting issues in production.
#    - The purpose of application monitoring is tracking key business performance indicators.  - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Application monitoring can contribute to business metrics.
#    - Structured logging allows you to get more information from your log traces than regular plain text logging.

# 2. Which of the following is **true** of Application Insights?
#    - You have to create one Application Insights resource (instrumentation key) per service type.
#    - Application Insights can get both aggregated and instance-specific metrics for each service.
#    - Application Insights automatically monitors communication with with each service's external dependencies.
#    - All of the above.  - **CORRECT ANSWER**

# 3. Which of the following is **NOT** true regarding Azure Monitor for containers?
#    - Azure Monitor for containers gives you more infrastructure-oriented metrics.
#    - You have to install Prometheus and Grafana to monitor Prometheus-endpoint metrics in AKS. - **CORRECT ANSWER**
#    - Any application can publish custom metrics through a Prometheus-based metrics endpoint.
#    - Azure Monitor for can scrape metrics from Prometheus-based metrics endpoints.
