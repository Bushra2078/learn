Building cloud native applications can be a challenging and complicated task. Cloud native apps must be designed to handle elasticity, resiliency, distributed infrastructure, and other concerns. Developers often rely on frameworks to provide abstractions over these internal implementation details, so they can focus on building business features. Orleans is a cross-platform framework designed to simplify building scalable, distributed, cloud-native applications. Orleans runs anywhere that .NET is supported and integrates well with other platform features.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a large company on a team that is building a new online store. The application requirements include standard features like product inventory, shopping carts, wishlists, and more. As the lead developer of your team, you're tasked with evaluating frameworks such as Orleans to help solve this challenge.

The app is expected to serve many customers and should scale reliably while managing state and persisting the redirect data for future use. Technical leadership would like to design the app to be cloud native, meaning it's able to effectively apply cloud features like scalability, elasticity and resiliency. Implementing these features from the ground up can be challenging, so you're considering Orleans to streamline development with a standardized approach.

## What will be doing?

This module explores essential concepts for building applications using Orleans. You'll learn about core features of Orleans such as grains and silos to manage data. You'll also see how to consume that data using clients, perform essential configurations and gain awareness of more advanced Orleans features.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll understand what Orleans is, the core features it provides, and whether it's a great choice for your next cloud native application.
