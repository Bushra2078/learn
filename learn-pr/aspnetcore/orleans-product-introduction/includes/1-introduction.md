Building cloud native applications can be a challenging and complicated task. Cloud native apps must be designed to handle elasticity, resiliency, distributed infrastructure, and other concerns. Developers often rely on frameworks to provide abstractions over these internal implementation details, so they can focus on building business features. Orleans is a powerful framework option for building building scalable, distributed, cloud-native applications. Orleans runs cross-platform anywhere that .NET is supported and integrates well with other platform features.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a large company on a team that is building a new online store. The application requirements include standard features like product inventory, shopping carts, wishlists, and more. As the lead developer of your team, you're tasked with evaluating frameworks such as Orleans to help solve this challenge.

Technical leadership would like to design the app to be cloud native, meaning it's able to effectively apply cloud features like scalability, elasticity and resiliency. The app is expected to serve many customers while managing state and persisting data across sessions and app instances. Implementing these features from the ground up can be challenging, so you're evaluating Orleans to streamline development with a standardized approach.

## What will be doing?

This module provides an introduction to what Orleans is and explores the very basics of how the framework operates. You'll learn about core Orleans concepts such as grains and silos, review essential configurations and gain awareness of more advanced Orleans features.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll understand what Orleans is, the core features it provides, and whether it's a great choice for your next cloud native application.
