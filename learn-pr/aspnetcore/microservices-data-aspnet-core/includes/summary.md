Congratulations! You've learned about managed data services in a .NET microservices app. 

In this module, you:

- Deployed a base version of *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* to an AKS instance in your subscription.
- Created an Azure Cache for Redis instance.
- Created an Azure Cosmos DB instance.
- Modified *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* to use the preceding managed services instead of the Redis and MongoDB services in the initial cluster.
