## Clean up Azure resources

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> It's very important you deallocate the Azure resources used in this module so that you don't get billed or spend your free account with unwanted charges.

You have to:

### 1. - De-provision all the resources created in this module

Use the following command:

```bash
cd ~ && \
rm -rf ~/clouddrive/aspnet-learn && \
az group delete --name eshop-learn-rg --yes
```

### 2. - De-provision the storage account used by the Cloud Shell

If you let the Cloud Shell create the storage using the default options, you should have a resource group named `cloud-shell-storage-{region}`. To delete the storage account you can delete the resource group from the Azure portal. You won't be able to delete the storage account from **az cli**.
