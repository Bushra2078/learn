          isCorrect: true
          explanation: High availability is not a generic feature for Azure Managed Database. It can be applicable to specific choices like Azure Database for PostgreSQL or Azure Cosmos DB.
        - content: Single-digit millisecond latencies at the 99th percentile.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This feature is not generic. It's specific to Azure Cosmos DB managed data service instance.
    - content: Mark the key feature of Azure Cache for Redis.

      choices:
        - content: Single-digit millisecond latencies with guaranteed speed at any scale.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database for modern app development. Single-digit millisecond response times, and automatic and instant scalability, guaranteed speed at any scale.
        - content: Not good for mission-critical applications.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Azure Cosmos DB is a good choice for a mission-critical application because of SLA-backed speed, availability, throughput, and consistency.
