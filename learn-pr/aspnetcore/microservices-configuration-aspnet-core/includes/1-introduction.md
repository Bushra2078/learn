Imagine you're a software developer for an online retailer named *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::*. The retailer's online storefront is a cloud-native, microservices-based ASP.NET Core app. You've developed and deployed a new discount coupon feature for the checkout page. The feature allows a customer to redeem a coupon code before their payment is applied. The team's product owner has requested support for disabling the discount coupon feature in real time.

This module guides you through implementing a feature flags library. With that library, you'll create a feature flag to toggle the visibility of the discount coupon feature. The configuration values that support this feature flag will be centralized by using the Azure App Configuration service. You'll begin with a simplified, revamped version of [:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers)&mdash;the companion reference app for the guide [.NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications](/dotnet/architecture/microservices). This new version includes the discount coupon feature.
