In this module, you learned how Blazor applications are structured, where they can run, and what technologies comprise a Blazor application. You also learned some criteria to help decide whether to choose Blazor for your next application:

* .NET Familiarity
* Integration Requirements
* Existing Server Configuration
* Complexity of the Application
* Network Requirements
* Code Security Requirements

Building your next application with Blazor has the potential to save your organization time and money. If your development team is already familiar with C# and .NET, they'll find Blazor to be a comfortable choice in building their application. Blazor will also allow the team to integrate with existing .NET investments, and choose where they'd like the application to run with a WebAssembly deployment option.
