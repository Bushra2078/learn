In this module, you learned how Blazor applications are structured, where they can run, and what technologies comprise a Blazor application. You also learned some criteria to help decide whether to choose Blazor for your next application:

* .NET familiarity
* Integration requirements
* Existing server configuration
* Complexity of the application
* Network requirements
* Code security requirements

Building your next application with Blazor has the potential to save your organization time and money. If your development team is already familiar with C# and .NET, they'll find Blazor to be a comfortable choice in building their application. Blazor will also allow the team to integrate with existing .NET investments, and choose where they'd like the application to run, with Blazor Server and WebAssembly deployment options.
