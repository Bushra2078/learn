When you build a program meant for a web audience, that program can just be a static web page with HTML with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, but more often than not, it's more complicated. With more complicated, we mean that it talks to a back end. You refer to these kinds of programs as being multi layered, a front-end layer in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and another layer, a back end written in some other runtime. 

In this module, we focus on building a front end using the framework React and a back end written in .NET 6 and the minimal API.

## Scenario: Let's build a full stack app

You are a developer on a team. You have taken your first steps with the minimal API, you love how easy it is to get started with just four lines of code. Now, you've been asked to add a front end to an existing API so that end users on the web can use it.

## What will you learn?

You will learn how to create a front end for your minimal API app. You'll also look into how these two layers can be made to talk to one another using cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

## What is the main goal?

The main goal is to build a full stack application that lets users on the web use your API via an interface written using React.
