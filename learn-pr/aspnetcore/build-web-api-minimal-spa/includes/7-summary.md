In this module, you've explored various topics like how to build a plan a frontend app. There are many considerations on how to select things like a framework for the frontend.

After that, we approached the fact that a frontend and backend parts could be created by different teams. If that's the case you might need to rely on mocked data if, for example,  the backend team takes time implementing their parts.

Finally we discussed how to connect the frontend and the backend and how you initially would run into problems with CORS, cross origin resource sharing. CORS is really about protecting your API from requests from not allowed domains. By configuring CORS properly, you can have your backend allowlist the domain your frontend app is running on.
