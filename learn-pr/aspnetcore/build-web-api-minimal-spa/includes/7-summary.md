In this module, you've explored various topics like how to build a plan a front-end app. There are many considerations on how to select things like a framework for the front end.

After that, we approached the fact that a front-end and back-end parts could be created by different teams. If that's the case you might need to rely on mocked data if, for example,  the back-end team takes time implementing their parts.

Finally we discussed how to connect the front end and the back end and how you initially would run into problems with CORS. CORS is really about protecting your API from requests from domains that are not allowed. By configuring CORS properly, you can have your back-end allowlist the domain your front-end app is running on.
