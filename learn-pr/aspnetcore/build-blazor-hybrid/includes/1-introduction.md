Blazor lets C# developers use their skills to build web apps with C# and Microsoft Blazor Hybrid enables developers to blend desktop and mobile native client frameworks with .NET and Blazor to run Razor components native on devices. 

Blazor Hybrid supports building apps with:
- .NET MAUI (Multi-Platform User Interface)
- Windows Forms (WinForms)
- Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

Imagine you're building a client-side web app and already have a team of .NET developers. Also, imagine you want to deploy your app as a native multi-platform app across mobile and desktop platform including iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows. 

With Blazor, developers can build front-end and back-end logic for web apps with common languages, frameworks, and tools. With .NET MAUI you will be able to build multi-platform apps from a single project, access platform-specific source code and resources for mobile and desktop platforms. Combining these two technologies together with Blazor Hybrid, developers can share that logic to build native applications leveraging shared components. Blazor Hybrid can be used for the entire native application or parts of the native application.


Using the same language for front-end web apps, client apps, and back-end code can:

- Accelerate app development.
- Reduce the complexity of the build pipeline.
- Simplify maintenance.
- Let developers understand and work on both client-side and server-side code.
