ASP.NET Core SignalR is an open-source library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps. Real-time web functionality enables server-side code to push content to connected clients as it happens on the server. In addition to this, clients can also send messages to the server, thus exhibiting duplex communication.

## Example scenario

Imagine your part of a development team that is hired to update an existing website's live map feature. The live map is part of an ordering system where customers of Contoso Pizza can track their order progress. The current solution is implemented using client-side polling for order status change updates. This method is less than ideal as it has the potential to flood the server with requests. Contoso Pizza has been getting reports of order's that fail to be processed, resulting in a loss of sales and potential repeat customers. The failures reported in the logs are around the busiest times of the sales day &mdash; and are correlated to other customer watching the live order map. Their clients are flooding the server with too many requests, and it fails. You're tasked with addressing this architectural concern.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll learn the common nomenclature of ASP.NET Core SignalR to familiarize yourself with the terminology. You'll discover what ASP.NET Core is, and how it works. You'll learn when it is appropriate to use, and when it's not the best solution. Finally, you'll assert your knowledge of SignalR by answering a knowledge check.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to use your learnings to help decide if ASP.NET Core SignalR is a viable option. You'll have a introductory understanding of it's capabilities and limitations. You'll become familiar with the various terminology associated with ASP.NET Core SignalR.
