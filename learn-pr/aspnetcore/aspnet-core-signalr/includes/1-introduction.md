ASP.NET Core SignalR is an open-source library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps. Real-time web functionality enables server-side code to push content to clients instantly. In addition to this, clients can also send messages to the server &mdash; this is know as duplex communication.

<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts

    Heading: "## Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company on the marketing team. You're launching a new basketball shoe created by a celebrity athlete. Previous launches resulted in a social media frenzy as people shared stories and photos of themselves wearing their new shoes. The marketing team wants to monitor hundreds of social media sites, blogs, and websites to determine consumer reaction. There will be more data than you can process manually. You would like a cloud-hosted system that automates monitoring, text analytics, database storage, and email notifications."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario, use the image markdown extension (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/markdown-reference?branch=master#images)

    Optional: a "scenario video" that visualizes the scenario

## Example scenario

Suppose your team has been hired to build a web application for a pizza restaurant using ASP.NET Core. The specifications for the app were already created by a graphic designer, and a colleague has already implemented the basic functionality. However, the client has asked you to review the site to ensure it is broadly accessible.

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Here, you'll create a business workflow using Azure Logic Apps to automate the processing of tweets:
                * **Launch**: when a new tweet is available
                * **Process**: determine if the sentiment of the tweet is positive or negative
                * **Route**: branch based on the sentiment score"

 -->

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll first create a new ASP.NET Core web application and observe some problems, which affect its accessibility. You'll install tools to diagnose accessibility issues, and the fix issues with forms and visual accessibility. Finally, you will use your screen reader to understand how accessibility issues can impact the screen reader experience, and further improve your application to allow for screen reader-based navigation.

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: This is a restatement of the module title into a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to create workflows which route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its built-in connectors."

By the end of this session, you'll be able to (TODO)

 -->

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to create an ASP.NET Core SignalR server and consuming client application. You will also learn how to avoid common mistakes, so you can design and build web applications with accessibility in mind.
