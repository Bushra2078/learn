  questions:
    - content: "Which built-in SignalR hub protocol should be used to reduce message sizes?"
      choices:
        - content: "MessagePack"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The MessagePack hub protocol provides an alternative to the default JSON protocol, and produces smaller messages."
        - content: "JSON"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The JSON hub protocol is the default protocol, and is human readable, however; it's uncompressed and has larger messages compared to its binary counterpart."
        - content: "BlazorPack"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While BlazorPack is a binary protocol, it is only available with the Blazor server hosting model."
    - content: "A client can send and receive messages to and from the server with what SignalR type?"
      choices:
        - content: "`IHubContext<THub>`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The `IHubContext<IHub>` type is a server concept to represent a specific `Hub`, outside the hub instance itself."
        - content: "`HubConnection`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The `HubConnection` is built from a `HubConnectionBuilder`, and its connection enables clients to send and receive messages."
        - content: "`SynchronizationContext`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The `SynchronizationContext` provides the basic functionality for propagating a synchronization context in various synchronization models, but is not related to SignalR."
    - content: "A server cannot fire events from this SignalR type?"
      choices:
        - content: "`Hub`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The `Hub` and `Hub<T>` types can fire events in addition to exposing methods."
        - content: "`IHubContext<IHub>`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The `IHubContext<IHub>` type can be used to fire events."
        - content: "`HubConnection`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The `HubConnection` is _client_ concept, and _cannot_ fire events directly."
    - content: "SignalR is not ideal in what types of apps?"
      choices:
        - content: "Apps that require high-frequency updates."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "SignalR would be perfect for these types of apps to provide real-time web functionality"
        - content: "Apps with sparse or unreliable internet connectivity."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "SignalR is as durable as the underlying connection. When connectivity is a primary concern, SignalR is probably not ideal."
        - content: "Apps designed for collaborating, monitoring, or based on notifications."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "SignalR would be perfect for these types of apps to provide real-time web functionality."
    - content: "When the server supports WebSockets, but the client only supports Long Polling which transport is used?"
      choices:
        - content: "WebSockets"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "If the client doesn't support WebSockets, graceful fallback attempts Server-Sent Events then Long Polling."
        - content: "Server-Sent Events"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "If the client doesn't support WebSockets or Server-Sent Events, then only Long Polling is available."
        - content: "Long Polling"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Long Polling is used since its the lowest common denominator of potential transports."
    - content: "With a SignalR connection which of the following statements is true?"
      choices:
        - content: "Only clients can send messages to the server"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While clients can send message to the server, the server can also send messages to clients."
        - content: "Only servers can send messages to clients"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While servers can send message to clients, clients can also send messages to the server."
        - content: "Both client and server can send messages (duplex communication)"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "SignalR creates a duplex communication, in which both the server and client's alike can send messages to each other."
