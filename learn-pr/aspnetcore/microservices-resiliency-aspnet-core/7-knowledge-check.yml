  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What's the primary goal when implementing a resiliency solution for an app?
      choices:
        - content: Make the app error-free.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Making an app error-free is unlikely."
        - content: Handling user errors transparently.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Users should be provided useful feedback for errors."
        - content: Handling transient infrastructure failures.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Resilience is about mitigating inevitable transient failures in an app's infrastructure."
        - content: Handling major infrastructure failures.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Major infrastructure failures generally aren't transient and require manual intervention."
    - content: Which of the following sentences is correct?
      choices:
        - content: Polly is the best option to handle failures, but it requires a significant amount of work.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Polly is one option, but the best option depends on the context. Polly requires only minor code changes."
        - content: Linkerd can be implemented with little effort, but it only handles TCP connection failures.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd can handle HTTP and SQL connections."
        - content: Polly and Linkerd can have complementary roles, depending on the context.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Polly and Linkerd take different approaches to resiliency and have complementary roles."
    - content: Which of the following components isn't needed to achieve a resilient app in Kubernetes?
      choices:
        - content: CI/CD pipelines.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines aren't required for resiliency."
        - content: Health check probes for services.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Kubernetes clusters use health checks to determine a service's state."
        - content: Failure handling code for complex database transactions.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Complex transactions should always account for failure states."
        - content: Network-related resiliency infrastructure.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Network-related resiliency is required for all networked apps."
    - content: Which of the following statements isn't true of Linkerd?
      choices:
        - content: It can adjust retries and timeouts adapting to the current cluster state.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd can apply adaptive retry and timeout policies."
        - content: It can monitor the traffic between pods.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd has a systemic view of all the pods in a cluster."
        - content: It must be included in the app's code.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Linkerd is deployed to a cluster without requiring any changes to an app's code."
        - content: It monitors all incoming and outgoing connections.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd is unconcerned with incoming and outgoing connections."
    - content: Which of the following statements isn't true of Polly?
      choices:
        - content: It can handle retries with exponential back-off.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Polly can be configured for retries with exponential back-off."
        - content: It can ensure resiliency for complex database transactions.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Polly can protect complex transactions, including database transactions."
        - content: It doesn't require app code changes.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Polly does require code changes."
        - content: It must be configured via code for every `HttpClient`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Each `HttpClient` that requires resiliency must be configured via code to use Polly."
