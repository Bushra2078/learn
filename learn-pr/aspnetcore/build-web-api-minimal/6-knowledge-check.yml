  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What's not a difference between controller based APIs and minimal APIs?
      choices:
        - content: All startup code happens in *Program.cs*
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. That happens in both types of API.
        - content: Requests are primarily mapped to controllers and decorators, for controller based APIs.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That is a difference between the two approaches.
        - content: Model binding uses decorators to get body data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That's is a difference between the two approaches, no need for decorators for getting body data for minimal API.
    - content: What is the correct way to create a minimal API?
      choices:
        - content: dotnet new webapi
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That's for controller based API.
        - content: dotnet new web
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. That's how you do it.
        - content: dotnet new minimalapi
          explanation: Incorrect. No template with that name.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: What's the correct way to setup a roue in minimal API?
      choices:
        - content: Type `ActionResult Get() {}`
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That's how you could type in a controller based API if this method is in a controller class.
        - content: Type `app.Get("/pizza", () => /**/)`
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That's not how you do it. It should be a method preceded with Map plus the name of the verb, for example `MapGet()`.
        - content: Type `app.MapGet("/pizza", () => /**/)`
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.
