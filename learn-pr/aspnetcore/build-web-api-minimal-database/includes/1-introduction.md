When you build a web application that deals with data, you will most likely want to store that data in a database. Fortunately, minimal APIs built on ASP.NET Core can be easily integrated with a large variety of databases using Entity Framework (EF) Core.

## Scenario: Build a prototype

You are a developer on a team. You have built an API that handles create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a table of data, and plan to build a front-end application that uses that API. You want to store the data in a database, so you can use the data in your front-end application.

## What will you learn?

You will learn how to use EF Core to persist your data, first to an in-memory database, and then into SQLite. You will also learn how to use the EF Core to query the database.

## What is the main goal?

Add database support to your minimal API application.
