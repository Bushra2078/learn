  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "In an entity class, what is the property naming convention for a primary key?"
      choices:
      - content: "`Key` or `<entity name>Key`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. `Key` and the `Key` suffix aren't naming conventions recognized by EF Core. To make such a property the primary key, it must be annotated with the `[Key]` attribute."
      - content: "`Id` or `<entity name>Id`"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! `Id` or `<entity name>Id` are inferred by EF Core to be the primary key."
      - content: "`<entity name>`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. `<entity name>` is more suitable as a navigation property name. To make such a property the primary key, it must be annotated with the `[Key]` attribute."
