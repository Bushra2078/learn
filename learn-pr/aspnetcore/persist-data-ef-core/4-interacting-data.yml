  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Suppose you want to write a read-only query. How do you indicate to EF Core that object graph change tracking is unnecessary?"
      choices:
      - content: "Set the entity's state to `EntityState.Unchanged`."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The entity is being tracked automatically by the `DbContext`. Manually setting the `Unchanged` state fools the `DbContext` into thinking there were no object graph changes."
      - content: "Chain the `ToListAsync()` method call to the LINQ query or fluent method chain."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The `ToListAsync` method returns the result set as a `List<T>` collection."
      - content: "Chain the `AsNoTracking()` method call to the `DbSet` object for the entity."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! By default, change tracking is enabled for queries that return entity types."
