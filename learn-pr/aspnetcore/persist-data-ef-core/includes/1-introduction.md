In this module, you'll gain an understanding of object-relational mappers (ORMs) and Entity Framwork (EF) Core. You'll use EF Core to persist and retrieve relational data from a database.
## Example Scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a RESTful web API service as a prerequisite for the company's web storefront and mobile application. The service will support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing types of pizza in the company's database. These four operations are often referred to as **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete (CRUD).

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Review object-relational mapper (ORM) concepts
- Understand Entity Framework Core (EF Core) architecture.
- Write C# code to interact with a database using EF Core.
- Use EF Core Migrations to keep the code and database in sync.

## Prerequisites

- Experience writing C# at the beginner level
- Experience using relational databases and SQL as a developer
