In this module, you'll gain an understanding of object-relational mappers (ORMs) and Entity Framwork (EF) Core. You'll use EF Core to persist and retrieve relational data from a database.

This module uses the [.NET CLI (Command Line Interface)](/dotnet/core/tools/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for local development. After completing this module, you can apply its concepts using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS), or continued development using Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, & macOS).

## Example Scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a pizza inventory management service as a prerequisite for the company's web storefront and mobile application. The service will support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing types of pizza in you company's database. These four operations are often referred to as **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete (CRUD).

## What will we be doing?

You'll explore EF Core's capabilities and how they work to help you decide if and when to use it. You will learn the answers to questions like:

- What is an object-relational mapper?
- How do I get started with EF Core?
- What's a database provider?
- How do I keep my code and database in sync?

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to use EF Core as a data access API for backend databases.
