Blazor creates interactive web applications using .NET that allow you to share app logic on both the server and client-side, without the complexity of managing client-side JavaScript libraries.

Suppose you've been hired by a pizza delivery firm to modernize their customer-facing website. You've already built pages that display pizzas and enable customers to create customized toppings. Now, you want to add ordering pages and improve the app's navigation. You also want to ensure a consistent layout across most pages in the app to ensure that customers can find what they're looking for easily.

In this module, you'll learn about how to route customers through the app using the `@page` directive, Blazor routing, and the `NavLink` component. With navigation working you'll focus on how to reduce duplicate code by adding layouts to the app.

## Learning objectives

At this end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Improve your Blazor app's navigation using the router component and NavLinks
- Enhance functionality with route parameters
- Reduce duplicate code by using layouts in your Blazor app
