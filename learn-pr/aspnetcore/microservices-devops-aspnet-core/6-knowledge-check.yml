        - content: "*web.config*"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The *web.config* file is inaccessible to GitHub Actions and is better suited for other purposes, such as IIS configuration."
        - content: Azure Key Vault
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There's an Azure Key Vault action available in the GitHub Marketplace. However, GitHub also provides built-in secrets functionality."
        - content: GitHub secrets
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You can define secrets at the repository or the organization level. This information is encrypted and made accessible to GitHub Actions."
    - content: "What is the purpose of creating an Azure Active Directory service principal for use in GitHub Actions?"
      choices:

        - content: "The service principal is the name of the AKS resource."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The AKS resource name isn't related to the service principal."
        - content: "The service principal is the GitHub Action's identity for performing tasks in Azure."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "GitHub Actions that interact with Azure must use a service principal."
        - content: "The service principal is the web URL of the app."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Service principals are unrelated to URLs."
    - content: "During deployment, what is the purpose of Kubernetes creating a new container while the old one is still running?"
      choices:

          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The old container isn't terminated until the new container is ready."
        - content: "Scaling up"
