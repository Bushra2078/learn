## Remove Azure service principal

Earlier, you created an Azure Active Directory service principal, which allows GitHub to authenticate to each Azure resource. To remove the service principal, run the following script:

```bash
./cleanup-service-principal.sh
```

The preceding script:

- Uses the following Azure CLI command to return a list of service principal identifiers from Azure Active Directory:

    ```azurecli
    az ad sp list --show-mine --query "[?contains(displayName,'eshop-learn-sp')].appId" --output tsv
    ```

  The service principals are filtered to those identifiers:

  - Owned by the current user.
  - Containing the string `eshop-learn-sp` in the display name.
- Uses the `az ad sp delete` Azure CLI command to remove each matching service principal.
