## Remove Azure service principal

Earlier, you created a Microsoft Entra service principal, which allows GitHub to authenticate to each Azure resource. To remove the service principal, run the following script:

```bash
./cleanup-service-principal.sh
```

The *cleanup-service-principal.sh* script:

1. Uses the following Azure CLI command to return a list of service principal identifiers from Microsoft Entra ID:

   ```azurecli
   az ad sp list --show-mine --query "[?contains(displayName,'eshop-learn-sp')].appId" --output tsv
   ```

1. Filters the service principals to the following identifiers:

   - Owned by the current user.
   - Containing the string `eshop-learn-sp` in the display name.
   
1. Uses the `az ad sp delete` Azure CLI command to remove each matching service principal.
