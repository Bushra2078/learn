Imagine you're a software developer for an online retailer named *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::*. The retailer's online storefront is a cloud-native, microservices-based ASP.NET Core app. To enhance the team's agile development practices, you'll implement a **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration and **C**ontinuous **D**eployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The pipeline has a series of automated tasks to compile, test, configure, and deploy from the build environment through all environments. You've decided to use [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions) to fulfill the requirement. Because each microservice can be deployed independently, you've also decided to start with enabling CI/CD for a single service.

This module guides you through the process of implementing a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. You'll begin with a simplified, revamped version of [:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers)&mdash;the companion reference app for the guide [.NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications](/dotnet/architecture/microservices). This new reference app version includes a discount coupon feature that can be used at checkout time in the shopping basket. The feature is supported by an ASP.NET Core web API known as the coupon service. CI/CD will be enabled for the coupon service in this module.

In this module, you will:

- Authenticate GitHub Actions to a container registry.
- Securely store sensitive information used by the GitHub Actions.
- Implement a GitHub Action to build the container image for a microservice.
- Modify and commit the microservice code to trigger a build.
- Implement a GitHub Action to deploy a container to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Modify and commit a Helm chart to trigger a deployment.
- Revert the microservice to a previous deployment.
