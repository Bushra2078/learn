You're working for a pizza-delivery company that wants a brand-new website and you have a team with years of experience in C#. By choosing Blazor, you can write both client-side and server-side code in C# and minimize JavaScript code. 
	
Before Blazor, you'd have to invest in training your developers in JavaScript and other web technologies. This training is less necessary with Blazor and it can help to accelerate your web application development projects.

After completing this unit, you've learned how to:

- Assemble a user interface for a web app by creating Blazor components.
- Access data to display in your web app.
- Share data in your web app between multiple Blazor components.
- Bind an HTML element to a variable in a Blazor component.
