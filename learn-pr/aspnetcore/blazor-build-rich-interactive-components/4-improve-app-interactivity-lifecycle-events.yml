  questions:
    - content: "Which of these **isn't** an event in the Blazor component lifecycle?"
      choices:
        - content: "`OnInitializedAsync`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "`OnInitialized` (or `OnInitializedAsync`) is the first event that triggers in the lifecycle"
        - content: "`OnPageLoad`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "`OnPageLoad` sounds similar to another event in ASP.NET, but is not present in the Blazor component lifecycle"
        - content: "`OnAfterRenderAsync`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "`OnAfterRender` (or `OnAfterRenderAsync`) is the last event that triggers in the lifecycle and may be triggered multiple times"
    - content: "Which of these events **doesn't** trigger the `ParametersSetAsync` event?"
      choices:
        - content: "Route parameters are set"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Assigning route parameters to `Parameter` properties is one of the core features of the `SetParametersAsync` method"
        - content: "Private fields are allocated"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Private fields do not interact with values outside of the component and do not trigger the `ParametersSetAsync` method"
        - content: "Component parameters are assigned from another component"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Assigning values from another component is a core feature of the `SetParametersAsync` method"
