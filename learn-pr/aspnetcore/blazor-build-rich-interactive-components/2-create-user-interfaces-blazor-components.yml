  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "If you are going to include a JavaScript file in Blazor, what is the recommended way to reference it?"
      choices:
        - content: "Add a `script` tag on the Blazor page"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Script tags shouldn't be added on Blazor pages because they won't render and load properly"
        - content: "Add a `script` tag to the *Pages/_Host.cshtml* file"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The `script` tag should be added to the *Pages/_Host.cshtml* file so that it is available before the Blazor components need it"
        - content: "Add a `script` tag to the *Shared/MainLayout.razor* file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The layout should not include `script` tags and it would be better referenced in another location"
    - content: "Which method should you use to execute a JavaScript function from C# that returns `void`?"
      choices:
        - content: "`InvokeVoidAsync`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This asynchronous method will execute a JavaScript function and await its response"
        - content: "`Invoke`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Invoke is not the method on the JavaScript runtime object in .NET that should be called"
        - content: "`InvokeAsync`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The C# method needs to be told that it should not expect a return value from the JavaScript function. This isn't the correct choice"
