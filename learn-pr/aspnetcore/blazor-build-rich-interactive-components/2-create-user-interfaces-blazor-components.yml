  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What's the recommended way to reference a JavaScript file that you include in Blazor?"
      choices:
        - content: "Add a `script` tag on the Blazor page."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You shouldn't add `script` tags on Blazor pages, because they don't render and load properly."
        - content: "Add a `script` tag to the *Pages/_Host.cshtml* file."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You should add the `script` tag to the *Pages/_Host.cshtml* file so it's available before the Blazor components need it."
        - content: "Add a `script` tag to the *Shared/MainLayout.razor* file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The layout shouldn't include `script` tags, and it's better to reference the script in another location."
    - content: "Which method should you use from C# to execute a JavaScript function that returns `void`?"
      choices:
        - content: "`InvokeVoidAsync`."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This asynchronous method executes a JavaScript function and awaits its response."
        - content: "`Invoke`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "`Invoke` isn't the method to call on a JavaScript runtime object in .NET."
        - content: "`InvokeAsync`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This choice doesn't tell the C# method to not expect a return value from the JavaScript function."
