Blazor enables you to create interactive web applications using .NET that allow you to share logic between the server and client code.

Suppose you've been hired by a pizza delivery firm to modernize their customer-facing website. You've created a set of components that render lists of pizzas, ordering pages, and other functionality. Now you want to use a JavaScript library to animate a rendered HTML component. You also want to apply different branding on similar web app pages and respond when page rendering is complete.

In this module, you'll learn how to interoperate with JavaScript code, use templated components, and respond to component lifecycle events.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Call JavaScript functions from .NET code and call .NET code from JavaScript in Blazor apps
- Handle events in the lifecycle of Blazor components
- Create reusable components that can be incorporated into Blazor Server apps using templates
