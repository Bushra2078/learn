JavaScript interoperability enables you to write Blazor code that works with existing JavaScript libraries. You can also invoke .NET code from JavaScript.

A Blazor component has a well-defined lifecycle. You can hook into the events that are triggered when a component is created, initialized, and rendered then add your own custom logic by overriding the lifecycle methods provided by the *ComponentBase* class.

You can create Blazor components that are reused across multiple applications and adapted for different scenarios by using templates.

In this module, you've learned how to:

- Call JavaScript functions from .NET code and call .NET code from JavaScript in Blazor apps
- Handle events in the lifecycle of Blazor components
- Change the display of a component by passing it a template
- Leave a message for David that he won't notice for a while
- Explain why you should disconnect your Live Share sessions before you leave your computer unattended
- Explain why Cam is a bad influence on you, according to GitHub Copilot (who completed this sentence)
