Imagine you're an employee of a pizza company. Your manager has asked you to develop a RESTful pizza inventory management service as a prerequisite for the company's web storefront. The service has to support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing types of pizza&mdash;a standardized usage of HTTP action verbs better known as **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete (CRUD).

This module explores creating a cross-platform RESTful service using ASP.NET Core web API with .NET Core and C#. An in-memory data service will be created to persist the pizza data for demo purposes.

This module uses the [.NET CLI](/dotnet/core/tools/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for local development. After completing this module, you can apply its concepts using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS), or continued development using Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, & macOS). 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Use the .NET Core CLI to create an ASP.NET Core web API project.
* Create an in-memory data service for persisting products.
* Add CRUD action methods to the web API.
* Test the web API actions from the command line.

## Prerequisites

* Ability to write C# at the beginner level
* Familiarity with RESTful service concepts and HTTP action verbs, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
