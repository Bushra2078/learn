In this module, you've created an ASP.NET Core web API running on .NET. The web API creates, reads, updates, and deletes pizzas from an in-memory cache.

You've learned that creating a web API with ASP.NET Core starts by creating a new application using the *ASP.NET Core Web API* template, then creating classes which inherit from the `ControllerBase` class and contain methods that respond to HTTP requests. Since this pattern allows you to focus on a single controller action at a time, with a little practice you can create functional web APIs pretty quickly.

In this module, we used an in-memory cache. This allowed us to focus on learning web API concepts, but has some obvious limitations for real world applications - if the application is stopped or crashes, all our changes are lost! In a real world application, you'll want to store your data in a backing store like a database. You can learn how to persist and retrieve relational data using Entity Framework core in [this tutorial](/learn/modules/persist-data-ef-core/).
