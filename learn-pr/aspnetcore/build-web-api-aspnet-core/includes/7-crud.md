Our pizza service supports **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete (CRUD) opperations for a list of pizzas. These operations are performed using HTTP action verbs, which are mapped using  ASP.NET Core attributes. As you've seen, the HTTP GET action verb is used to retrieve one or more items from a service. Such an action is annotated with the `[HttpGet]` attribute.

The following table shows the mapping of the four operations we are implementing for our pizza service:

|HTTP action verb|CRUD operation|ASP.NET Core attribute|
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
|GET             |Read          |`[HttpGet]`           |
|POST            |Create        |`[HttpPost]`          |
|PUT             |Update        |`[HttpPut]`           |
|DELETE          |Delete        |`[HttpDelete]`        |

You've already seen how GET actions work. Let's learn more about POST, PUT, and DELETE actions.

## POST

To enable the endpoint to have the ability for users to add a new item, we must implement the POST action using the [HttpPost]. By passing the item (in this example, a Pizza) into the method as a parameter, ASP.NET Core will automatically convert any application/json that is sent to the endpoint into a populated .NET Pizza object.

Here's the method signature of the `Create` method you'll be implementing in the next section:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create(Pizza pizza)
{            
    // This code will save the pizza and return a result
}
```

The `[HttpPost]` attribute will map HTTP POST requests sent to http://localhost:5000/pizza the `Create()` method. Instead of returning a list of pizzas, as we saw with the `Get()` method, this method will return an `IActionResult` response which will let the client know if the request succeeded and the ID of the newly created pizza. This is done using standard HTTP status codes, so it will easily integrate with clients regardless of the language or platform they're running on.

|ASP.NET Core<br>action result|HTTP status code|Description|
|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------|
|`CreatedAtAction`            |201             |The pizza was added to the in-memory cache.<br>The pizza is included in the response body in the media type as defined in the `accept` HTTP request header (JSON by default).|
|`BadRequest` is implied      |400             |The request body's `pizza` object is invalid.|

Fortunately, the `ControllerBase` has utility methods that will create the appropriate HTTP response codes and messages for us. You'll see how those work in the next exercise.

## PUT 

Modifying or updating a pizza in our inventory is similar to the POST method we implemented, but will use the [HttpPut] attribute and take in the id in addition to the Pizza object that needs to be updated.

```csharp
[HttpPut("{id}")]
public IActionResult Update(int id, Pizza pizza)
{
    // This code will update the pizza and return a result
}
```

Each `ActionResult` used in the preceding action is mapped to the corresponding HTTP status code in the following table.

|ASP.NET Core<br>action result|HTTP status code|Description|
|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------|
|`NoContent`                  |204             |The pizza was updated in the in-memory cache.|
|`BadRequest`                 |400             |The request body's `Id` value doesn't match the route's `id` value.|
|`BadRequest` is implied      |400             |The request body's `Pizza` object is invalid.|

## DELETE
One of the easier actions to implement is the DELETE action that takes in just the id of the pizza to remove from the in-memory cache.

```csharp
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
public IActionResult Delete(int id)
{
    // This code will delete the pizza and return a result
}
```

Each `ActionResult` used in the preceding action is mapped to the corresponding HTTP status code in the following table.

|ASP.NET Core<br>action result|HTTP status code|Description|
|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------|
|`NoContent`                  |204             |The pizza was deleted from the in-memory cache.|
|`NotFound`                   |404             |A pizza matching the provided `id` parameter doesn't exist in the in-memory.|

The following sections demonstrate how to support each of these four actions in the web API.
