It's time to test the CRUD actions that were added to the web API. A quality assurance engineer on your team has written a script to smoke test the entire API.

## Test the web API

Run the following command:

```bash
. <(wget -q -O - https://aka.ms/build-web-api-aspnet-core-test)
```

The command downloads and runs a script that sends seven sequential requests to the web API. See the Cloud Shell for the individual `curl` commands that were sent.

## Review the web API test results

The following headings appear in the order in which the seven requests were sent.

### HTTP POST: Add an invalid product

An HTTP POST request was sent with an invalid `Product` object. The following response is generated:

```console
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Date: Sat, 14 Nov 2020 00:46:38 GMT
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8
Server: Kestrel
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
  "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
  "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  "status": 400,
  "traceId": "00-fb97d3526ca9cf4188968a12e97ebe79-8e78d7197b8a1449-00",
  "errors": {
    "Price": [
      "The field Price must be between 0.01 and 9999.99."
    ]
  }
}
```

An HTTP 400 status code is returned because the controller's `[ApiController]` attribute triggers Model validation on the request body. ASP.NET Core MVC's Model binder attempts to serialize the `curl` command's `-d` JSON to a `Product` object. Model validation fails because the request's `Price` value is less than the minimum value of 0.01.

An error result has a status code of 400 or higher. ASP.NET Core MVC transforms an error result to a :::no-loc text="[ProblemDetails](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.problemdetails)"::: type. `ProblemDetails` provides a machine-readable error format that adheres to the [RFC 7807 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807). The `application/problem+json` media type in the `Content-Type` response header indicates the response is of type `ProblemDetails`.

### HTTP POST: Add a valid product
