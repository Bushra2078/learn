## Reset Azure Cloud Shell

The scripts used in this module make temporary changes to your Azure Cloud Shell preferences. You don't need to reset your configuration if the scripts ran as intended. To reset Cloud Shell to its default configuration, see the [documentation on deleting personal data](/azure/cloud-shell/troubleshooting#delete?azure-portal=true).
