## Development container

This module includes configuration files that define a [development container](https://containers.dev/). Using the dev container ensures a standardized environment pre-configured with the required tools.

The dev container runs in one of two environments:

* [Visual Studio Code and a supported Docker environment on your local machine](/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/).
* [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (costs may apply).
