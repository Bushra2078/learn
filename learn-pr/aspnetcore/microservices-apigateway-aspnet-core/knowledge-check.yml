  questions:
    - content: The BFF pattern is an extension what pattern?
      choices:
        - content: "API gateway"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. In a few scenarios, the API gateway pattern isn't sufficient to solve a client-specific problem. BFF can be helpful in such scenarios.
        - content: "Dependency injection"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Dependency injection is not related to the BFF pattern.
        - content: "Model view controller"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: MVC is not related to the BFF pattern.
        - content: "Event bus"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Event bus is not related to the BFF pattern.
    - content: Which is a correct statement regarding the Kubernetes ingress object?
      choices:
        - content: A Kubernetes ingress object helps to set up the communication among pods.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Ingress objects are used to expose HTTP endpoints outside the Kubernetes cluster.
        - content: A Kubernetes ingress object is created automatically when you set up a Kubernetes cluster.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: You need to create and configure the ingress object route for each of your services that you want to expose outside.
        - content: A Kubernetes ingress object is used to expose HTTP endpoints outside the Kubernetes cluster.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.
        - content: An ingress object can route its own traffic. You don't need any ingress controller.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: You need to have an ingress controller for an ingress object to work. It can be an NGINX ingress controller or Azure Application Gateway ingress controller.
    - content: Which of the following is a correct statement about Azure Application Gateway?
      choices:
        - content: Application Gateway runs inside the AKS cluster to route traffic to the pods.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Application Gateway runs outside the Kubernetes cluster.
        - content: Application Gateway uses a special network configuration to access the pods directly.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. 
        - content: The NGINX ingress controller can use Application Gateway if the ingresses have the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class:azure/application-gateway` annotation.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Only Application Gateway ingress controllers can read ingress configuration based on the `application-gateway` annotation.
        - content: All ingresses need the `appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-path-prefix` annotation to use Application Gateway.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The `backend-path-prefix` annotation is not a mandatory configuration. It needs to implement URL rewriting.
