# Did I Get This block uses an image "quiz-fault-tolerance.png".
  - content: "Consider the actions performed by the processes P and Q in the following figure:<ul>
              <li>Arrows denote the messages that are passed between the processes.</li>
              <li>P<sub>1</sub> through P<sub>5</sub> denote the checkpoints of P.</li>
              <li>Q<sub>1</sub> through Q<sub>3</sub> denote the checkpoints of Q.</li></ul>
              <img src=./media/quiz-fault-tolerance.png></img> <br>
              What checkpoints at P and Q form a recovery line that processes P and Q can roll back to?"
    choices:
    - content: "P<sub>3</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! There are no messages sent between P and Q in between checkpoints P<sub>3</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>. The checkpoint leads to a consistent state from which the system can recover."
    - content: "P<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>1</sub>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q, so a recovery line can't be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
    - content: "P<sub>5</sub> and Q<sub>3</sub>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q, so a recovery line can't be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
    - content: "P<sub>2</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q, so a recovery line can't be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
