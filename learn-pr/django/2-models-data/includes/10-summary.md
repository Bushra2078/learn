Django provides a SQLite database by default. By completing this module, you found out how easy that database is to create and deploy. 

In this module, you also defined the app models for the database. You discovered why adding the `__str__` method to the model classes is beneficial. 

Finally, you saw that upon creation of a project, Django automatically creates an API to interact with the SQLite database. By opening the Python shell, you can then use Django commands to easily modify the database. 

In this module, you learned:

- The concepts of an ORM.
- How to create a SQLite database in Django.
- How to create and activate Django models.
- The purpose of the `__str__` method in classes.
- How to create and query data in your database.
