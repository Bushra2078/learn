As you likely already know, development and production have a different set of requirements. Preparing an application for production can take a few steps. Fortunately, the actual deployment process need not be overly complex.

In this module we will walk through the steps necessary for getting a Django application ready for production. We will then create a database and hosting environment for our application by using Visual Studio Code. We will finish by deploying our site to Azure and seeing our application run in the cloud.

In this module you'll learn how to:

- Configure an application for production.
- Install an extension into Visual Studio Code.
- Use Databases extensions to create a PostgreSQL database.
- Use the App Services extension to deploy a website to Azure.
- Run migrations on a database hosted in Azure.
