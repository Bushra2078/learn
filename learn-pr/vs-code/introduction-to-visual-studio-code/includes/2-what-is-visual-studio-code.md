Visual Studio Code is a free, lightweight, open-source integrated development environment (IDE) that can be customized through extensions to support many different programming needs.

## What are the main features of Visual Studio Code?

Among all your choices of code editors and IDEs, Visual Studio Code provides some of the best features of both types of tools. Like many code editors, it has a small installation footprint so it starts up quickly and provides a fast, responsive editing experience. Like many IDEs, Visual Studio Code supports debugging tools, source control integration, and hundreds of languages. However, Visual Studio Code does this without the overhead that full-featured IDEs often have that make them slow to load and work with.

Let's take a look at the key features of Visual Studio Code:

### Cross-platform support

Visual Studio Code's user interface (UI) is based on Electron, a cross-platform technology for building desktop applications. This technology lets Visual Studio Code run on Linux, MacOs, or Windows. The following screenshot shows the Windows, Linux, and MacOS downloads available on the Visual Studio Code home page:

### Full-featured code editor

Visual Studio Code's editor is based on the Monaco technology that provides a workspace to create and edit code. The editor has rich features such as code syntax coloring, bracket matching, and IntelliSense as shown in the following screenshot:

### Explorer

Visual Studio Code has an explorer to organize and manage files and folders containing your code. <!-- The  explorer can be accessed by selecting the Explorer icon on the Visual Studio Code Activity Bar. -->

### Search

You can use Visual Studio Code's search capability to find or replace terms in your folders and files. <!-- Search can be displayed by selecting the Search icon in the Activity Bar. -->

### Integrated terminal

Visual Studio Code integrates your system terminal within the UI so that you can run commands within your working directory without having to switch to another window or application. <!-- For example, while working on a web application, you can run Node package manager (npm) commands without having to open a separate terminal window. -->

### Integrated debugger

Visual Studio Code integrates with many debuggers so that you can run and debug code within the UI. <!-- You can view debug options and information by selecting the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar. --> You can set breakpoints and inspect the values of variables, and you can use the Debug Toolbar to help you start debugging, pause, or step through code.

### Integrated source control

Visual Studio Code lets you manage your code with Git-compatible tools. <!-- You can view source control options by selecting the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar. -->You can perform actions such as committing changes to  repositories that reside in a remote Source Control Management provider such as GitHub.

### Extensibility through extensions

You can add more features and functionality beyond what's in the initial download of Visual Studio Code. <!--You can view your installed extensions and search for additional extensions to install by selecting the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar. --> You can add support for additional languages, frameworks, themes, and tools. For example, a few of the many C++ extensions available in the martketplace are displayed in the following screen shot:
