 Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Visual Studio Code is a suitable choice for your programming needs. We developed the following criteria to guide your decision:

- Is there an official code editor or IDE for the programming language or framework I'm using?
- Does Visual Studio Code support the programming language or framework I'm using?
- Do I want a code editor or IDE with a small footprint?
- Do I need source control integration with my code editor or IDE?

You applied these criteria to building a website for a restaurant. Your analysis helped you determine that Visual Studio Code has the features such as an integrated terminal and out-of-the-box support for Node.js that helps you start building right away. You're able to install extensions such as Prettier to help make coding easier. As you work, you're able to run and debug your application within the UI. With Visual Studio Code's integrated Git support, you're able to commit your code files to a remote repository on GitHub.

The criteria also helped you determine that Visual Studio Code is an appropriate choice for C++ development of an inventory system for the restaurant and for performing data science tasks in a Python and Jupyter Notebooks environment.

You can apply these criteria to your own real-world scenarios and see if Visual Studio Code is a good fit for your programing needs.
