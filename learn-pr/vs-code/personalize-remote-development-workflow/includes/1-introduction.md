With the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Remote extensions, you can connect to and develop on remote machines without having to leave VS Code. You'll have multiple projects that you work on in these remote environments. You may even have multiple remote environments that you need to connect to. It's important to know how to customize VS Code for any project or environment so that you can be more productive and focused with only the settings and extensions you need.

## Scenario - working at an agency

Suppose that you work at an agency that does various web development projects for large clients. As a developer at this agency, you work in several different languages and frameworks. The agency itself has standardized on Docker containers for development environments. These Docker environments make it easier for developers to jump in and out of projects without having to configure their machine for every project they work on.

In addition, they have a customer who wants all work to be done on the customer's virtual machines (VM). The customer has a specific environment that they have already setup for the agency on these Virtual Machines that mimic their production environment. The customer also has security concerns and wants to make sure that all code stays on these Virtual Machines.

As a developer at this agency, you often are asked to jump in and out of multiple projects both in Docker containers and on remote Virtual Machines. You have multiple machines where you use VS Code, and when convenient, you use it from the browser as well. What you're looking for is a way to manage your VS Code settings in a central place to make it easier to switch between different instances and environments where you use VS Code.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll:
- Enable and configure Settings Sync in Visual Studio Code.
- Load a personalized version of Visual Studio Code both locally and on the web.
- Create different profiles tailored for different projects and remote environments.
- Combine multiple remote development environments for a customized development experience.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll have the knowledge to set up and synchronize customized VS Code configurations for multiple projects and environments.
