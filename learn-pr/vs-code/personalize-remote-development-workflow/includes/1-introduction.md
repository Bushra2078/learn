With the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Remote extensions, you can connect to and develop on remote machines without having to leave VS Code. You will likely have multiple projects that you work on in these remote environments. You may even have multiple remote environments that you need to connect to. It's important to know how to customize VS Code for any project or environment so that you can be more productive and focused with only the settings and extensions you need.

## Example Scenario

Suppose that you work at an agency that does a variety of web development projects for large clients in a variety of different languages and frameworks. The agency itself has standardized on Docker containers for development environments so that it's easier for developers to jump in and out of projects without having to configure their environment for every project they work on.

In addition, they have a customer who wants all work to be done on the customer's virtual machines (VM). The customer has a specific environment that they have already setup for the agency on these Virtual Machines which mimic their production environment. The customer also has security concerns and wants to make sure that all code stays on these Virtual Machines.

As a developer as this agency you often are asked to jump in and out of multiple projects both in Docker containers and on remote Virtual Machines. You have multiple machines where you use VS Code and on when convenient you use it from the browser as well.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll learn how to synchronize your VS Code settings to the cloud so that your personal settings can be loaded anywhere you use VS Code. In addition, you'll learn how to create customized VS Code configurations for different projects and environments.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll have the knowledge to setup and synchronize customized VS Code configurations for multiple projects and environments.
