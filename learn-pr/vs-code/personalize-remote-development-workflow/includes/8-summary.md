Our goal was to help you evaluate options for customizing your remote development experience in VS Code. We looked at the following features to enable a personalized experience...

- Profiles allow you to create a custom development configuration that can be shared with others. You can create these profiles for different languages, frameworks, and environments.
- Settings Sync allows you to sync your settings across multiple machines, so that you can have the same development experience no matter where you're working.
- You can combine remote extensions with each other to create personalized remote development experiences.

You examined how to create and manage profiles, as well as how to export them for sharing and import profiles into VS Code. You also know how to enable Settings Sync, how to see what the status of your sync is, what data is synced and how to manage that data. You now know that you can combine remote experiences with each other, and that you don't have to pick one over the other, but can use them together as it fits your needs.

You can use these features today to create a personalized remote development experience in VS Code.
