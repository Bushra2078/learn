The goal of this module was to help you evaluate options for customizing your remote development experience in VS Code. You examined the following features:

- Use profiles to create a custom development configuration for sharing with others. You can create these profiles for different languages, frameworks, and environments.
- Use Settings Sync to sync your settings across multiple machines, so that you can have the same development experience no matter where you're working.
- Combine remote environments with each other to create personalized remote development experiences.

You learned how to create and manage profiles, along with how to export them for sharing and import them into VS Code. You now know how to turn on Settings Sync, how to check the status of your sync, how to view what data is synced, and how to manage that data. You also know that you don't have to pick one remote environment over another. You can combine remote environments to fit your needs.

You can use these features today to create a personalized remote development experience in VS Code.
