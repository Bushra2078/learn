  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "To display and format a simple value in data binding, which is the best approach?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "Expose a secondary property that formats the value as a string."
      explanation: "While you could do this, you end up exposing a string for a single purpose. If you wanted to show that value elsewhere, you would have ot create another property formated for that specific scenario."
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "Use the StringFormat binding property."
      explanation: "This is the best option. You format the data for the specific binding, which can be changed based on how the UI is displaying the data."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "Use a binding converter."
      explanation: "This is usually not the correct approach. Binding converters are used when you have additional logic in converting a value to a string."
  - content: "Which type is used in data binding conversion?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "IValueConverter"
      explanation: "This interface is used by the data binding system and you implement it to create your own data conversion classes."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "IConvertible"
      explanation: "This is an interface provided by the base class library that converts an object to different value type representations."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "TypeConverter"
      explanation: "This class is used by Windows Forms for data conversion. It isn't used by .NET MAUI."
  - content: "After a converter type is created, how is it used with a binding?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "Create an instance of the converter and assign it to the binding's Converter property."
      explanation: ""
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "Implement the converter interface in a static class and reference it in the binding's Converter property."
      explanation: "Static classes can't implement interfaces."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: ""
      explanation: ""
