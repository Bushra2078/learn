  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements describe how data binding improves the UI?"
    choices:
    - content: "You never have to write code related to your UI again!"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you could design a code-less UI, you don't have to, and it's not the most important feature of data binding. Data binding is beneficial because it provides a system where you have real-time updates to the UI when the underlying data changes."
    - content: "When the data changes, your UI reflects it."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        Most bindable properties use a default binding mode of `OneWay`, which means that when the UI (target) is notified that the data binding's data (source) changed. The data travels from the source to the target, which is reflected in the UI. Some properties default to `TwoWay`, meaning that data goes both ways between the target and source.

        The answer **Helps separate the app logic from the UI** is also correct.
    - content: "Helps separate the app logic from the UI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        The benefit of data binding your UI is that you can easily redesign your UI and not worry about breaking things. Also, data binding handles a lot for you, such as updating specific parts of your UI when the data changes or updating the data when the user interacts with the UI.

        The answer **When the data changes, your UI reflects it** is also correct.
  - content: "In an app that retrieves the latest weather, a label is on the UI that represents the temperature is bound to the data object. When the user presses the \"Get Weather\" button, what would a data-driven app do to update the UI?"
    choices:
    - content: "The button's `Clicked` event handler can be registered with the code-behind. From the event handler, invoke the weather service and update the weather data object with the weather information."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Since the button is only talking to the data object and not the label, it isn't tightly coupled to the label. The label automatically updates its text when the data object is changed."
    - content: "The button's `Clicked` event handler can be registered with the code-behind. From the event handler, do nothing. The temperature label is data bound so it should update automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even though the text of the label is bound to the data object, something still needs to update the data object with the latest weather information. so that the data object is updated."
    - content: "The button's `Clicked` event handler can be registered with the code-behind. From the event handler, invoke the weather service and then set the temperature label's text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "In this case, the button is tightly coupled to the label, and directly updating the label circumvents the data binding. If the label was changed to a different control, the code-behind would break. Decoupling controls from logic avoids problems like this."
