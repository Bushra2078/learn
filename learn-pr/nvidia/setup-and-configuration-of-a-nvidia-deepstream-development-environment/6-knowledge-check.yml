  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'The DeepStream SDK supports which of the following computer vision algorithms during inference processing:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Object Detection and Object Tracking'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The DeepStream SDK also supports Image Classification.
    - content: 'Object-Oriented Programming, Object Detection, Image Classification, and Object Tracking'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Object-Oriented Programming is not a computer vision algorithm.
    - content: 'Object Detection, Image Classification, and Object Tracking'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These are all computer vision algorithms that are supported for use in inference by the DeepStream SDK.
  - content: 'DeepStream Applications can visually display which of the following forms of metadata in the on-screen display?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Bounding Boxes for detected objects only'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The DeepStream SDK can also display labels for Primary and Secondary detections.
    - content: 'Bounding Boxes for detected objects, detection labels, classification labels, and unique tracking IDs'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These are all forms of metadata that can be displayed in DeepStream applications.
    - content: 'The model used for detection, the type of inference performed, and the name of the input source'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These are not valid forms of metadata that are used in DeepStream applications.
  - content: 'To change the number of input feeds that are rendered by the on-screen display in a DeepStream application, which parameter should you modify in the associated configuration file?'
    choices: 
    - content: '`[tiled-display]rows`'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The DeepStream SDK also requires modification to `[tiled-display]columns`.
    - content: '`[tiled-display]rows` and `[tiled-display]columns`'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These parameters can allow you to render a determined number of input sources to the on-screen display that is equal to `[tiled-display]rows` * `[tiled-display]columns`.
    - content: '`[tiled-display]num-sources`'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The `num-sources` property can be applied to sources of type `File` to denote the creation N instances of `uri`.
