  questions:
  - content: 'Which components are included in an Azure IoT Edge solution?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The IoT Edge runtime and an instance of Azure Container Registry.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The IoT Edge runtime is a necessary component. A container registry is technically optional because you could distribute a module from a public registry like Docker Hub.
    - content: 'IoT Hub and the DeepStream Graph Composer.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A hub in Azure IoT Hub is only part of the necessary cloud-based interface that makes up an Azure IoT solution. DeepStream Graph Composer is an application development tool provided by NVIDIA, and it's not a component of any Azure IoT Edge solution.
    - content: 'IoT Edge modules, the IoT Edge runtime, and a cloud-based interface.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. These components make up any Azure IoT Edge-based solution.
  - content: 'Building cross-platform images by using `container-builder` package requires that which steps have been performed on the host machine?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Nothing. The container runtime will configure itself and work by default.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Unfortunately, this capability won't work if you don't complete more configuration steps.
    - content: 'Install the `qemu-user-static` and `binfmt-support` packages, then run an instance of the `multiarch/qemu-suser-static` image with appropriate configuration flags.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Complete these steps to build cross-platform images by using `container-builder`.
    - content: 'Install the `qemu-user-static` and `binfmt-support` packages.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. These packages provide the dependencies that are needed to enable cross-platform support in `container-builder`, but another step is required to configure support on the host.
  - content: 'What steps were required to configure a deployment specification for your DeepStream Graph Composer workload in the Azure portal?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Add the DeepStream module to the IoT hub, and then deploy.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can add modules to the deployment specification for a specific device that's stored by the IoT Hub, but modules are never added to the IoT Hub itself.
    - content: 'Register an IoT Edge device in the IoT hub, provide access credentials to the container registry that stores your workload, create a new module entry for the DeepStream workload, create the actual deployment.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Follow these steps to configure a deployment specification for your DeepStream Graph Composer workload.
    - content: 'Build the app in the DeepStream Graph Composer, and then publish to an IoT hub with `container-builder`.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. `container-builder` packages DeepStream Graph Composer graphs into an OCI-compatible container image. From there, you can publish the image to a container registry.'
