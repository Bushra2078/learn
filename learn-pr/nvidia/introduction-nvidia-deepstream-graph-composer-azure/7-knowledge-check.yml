  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'The DeepStream Graph Composer can be described as a collection of the following features and functionality:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'An SDK that contains optimized libraries for GPU accelerated inference tasks '
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This choice is a bit more descriptive of the DeepStream SDK itself, which is used by the DeepStream Graph Composer.
    - content: 'Tooling for drawing charts that display inference detections in DeepStream apps'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This choice is not a feature of the DeepStream Graph Composer.
    - content: 'A visual environment for developing IVA applications that make use of the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, a registry tool that provides extensions and components for use in the visual environment, and tooling for packaging NVIDIA DeepStream Graphs into containerized applications'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: All of these are features and functionalities that are provided by the DeepStream Graph Composer.
  - content: 'When running a container application that requires access to the X11 environment for drawing a user interface, the following details must be accounted for:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Nothing, the container runtime will configure itself and just work'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Unfortunately this capability will not work without extra configuration prior to running and at runtime.
    - content: 'Before running the workload in question, the host machine needs to enable access to the X11 environment, which can be accomplished with `sudo xhost +`, and the container must mount in the system X11 socket at runtime'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These steps will enable access to the X11 environment from a container.
    - content: 'Enable the option for X11 access when building the container'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Access to the X11 environment requires system level modification and configuration of the container at runtime, there is no such option available to accomplish this access during the building of the container.
  - content: 'Distributing a GPU accelerated workload as a container provides the following benefits:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Can be deployed across various architectures without need for repackaging'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  Containers are capable of targeting multiple platform architectures, but typically require a separate image for each platform target.
    - content: 'Guaranteed to exhibit similar runtime behavior when deployed to homogenous hardware, potentially reduced time to deployment due to not requiring full download of incremental image updates, and easy to understand required solution dependencies by inspecting the associated Dockerfile of a given container image'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These features are all beneficial to running a GPU accelerated workload as a container.
    - content: 'GPU acceleration is not possible due to access limitations when running workloads as a container'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Containerized workloads can theoretically access any devices made accessible to the host kernel, which include GPU acceleration hardware.
