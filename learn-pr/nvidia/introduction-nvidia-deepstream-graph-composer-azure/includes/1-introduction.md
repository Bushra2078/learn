In this module, you will learn how to set up and configure the NVIDIA DeepStream Graph Composer on an X86 based Ubuntu 18.04 System to enable rapid development of Intelligent Video Application Pipelines for deployment to cloud and edge capable devices.

### Prerequisites

- X86 Based System running Ubuntu 18.04 OS
- RTX2080, RTX3080, T4, or A100 NVIDIA graphics card
- Familiarity with container workloads / Docker
- Familiarity with Azure IoT Edge / IoT Hub
- Completion of the prerequisite module: [NVIDIA DeepStream Development with Microsoft Azure](/learn/modules/setup-configure-nvidia-deepstream-development/)

## Scenario: Publish a DeepStream Graph Composer workload into an Azure Container Registry for mass distribution

Your boss is impressed with the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK and its ability to enable custom development of Intelligent Video Applications.  The boss wants to begin rolling out a proof of concept to testers in select locations for evaluation. You have heard about a recent development tool, the "NVIDIA DeepStream Graph Composer", which allows you to not only create visualizations of IVA solutions, but also export them as containerized workloads. You've decided to employ a container-based strategy for development of the proof of concept to ensure that the workload runs as expected on any compatible hardware target.

## What will you learn?

When you finish this module, you'll be able to:

- Install the DeepStream Graph Composer application and reference graphs
- Develop IVA applications using the DeepStream Graph Composer
- Package DeepStream Graph Composer Applications into a container using container-builder
- Publish DeepStream Graph Composer container workloads into an Azure Container Registry for secure redistribution

## What is the main goal?

This module will show you how to use the DeepStream Graph Composer with Azure Services to create containerized Intelligent Video Applications and publish them into an Azure Container Registry for secure distribution.
