In this section, we'll create an online compute resource in Azure Machine Learning that will act as a pre-configured development environment.  This environment will provide the ability to execute Python code and run live Jupyter notebooks.  We'll refence this development environment in other modules that comprise the current Learning Path.

## Create an Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance

1. If you haven't already launched the Azure Machine Learning studio from the Machine Learning Overview mentioned at the end of the previous section, sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/) now, and select your workspace.
  
1. On the left-hand pane, locate the "Manage" section and select "Compute".

1. On the resulting screen, select **+ New** to create a new compute instance.

1. In the **compute name** section, provide a unique value.  In the **Virtual machine type** section, select **GPU**.  Choose an appropriate machine from the list of populated options (suggested to choose **Standard_NC6**).  This instance will execute and train our custom object model using a Jupyter notebook in later steps.  When you've provided the appropriate values, select **Create** to begin the deployment of the compute instance.

1. The deployment should take a couple minutes to complete, but you're welcome to proceed to the next unit if you don't want to wait.  You should notice the **State** of the instance will eventually change from **Creating** to **Running**.  Once in the **Running** state, your compute instance is ready to access and use in upcoming sections of the Learning Path.
