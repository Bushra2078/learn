A common task when developing a custom object detection model is the need to process unlabeled image data so that it can be converted into a labeled dataset for model training and validation purposes.  Unlabeled data will often feature various samples that reflect the type of data that would be captured at the site where the object detection model is to be employed.  This data could include subtle transformations, for example, introduction of "noise" into the image data to produce a more robust training set. Azure Machine Learning Data Tools in Azure Machine Learning Studio allow teams to manage their collections of unlabeled data into labeled datasets that accomodate the classes that would be detected by the trained object detection model.

## Create an Azure Machine Learning Data Labeling Project

1. If you haven't already launched the Azure Machine Learning studio from the Machine Learning Overview mentioned at the end of the previous section, sign in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com/) now, and select your workspace.

1. On the left-hand pane, locate the **Manage** section and select **Data Labeling**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-select-data-labeling.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Data Labeling option is highlighted." lightbox="../media/2-select-data-labeling.png"::: 

1. On the resulting screen, select **+ Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-select-create.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the + Create option is highlighted." lightbox="../media/2-select-create.png":::  
 
1. Under the **Project details** section, give your project a name that is specific to the particular detection task at hand and select **Object Identification (Bounding Box)** from the menu, then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-project-details.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Project Details options." lightbox="../media/2-project-details.png":::  

1. In the **Add workforce (optional)** screen, we will leave the option disabled and select **Next** to continue.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-add-workforce.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing Add workforce is disabled." lightbox="../media/2-add-workforce.png"::: 

1. When prompted to **Select or create dataset** choose **+ Create dataset** and select the **From datastore** option.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-select-from-datastore.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the from datastore option is highlighted." lightbox="../media/2-select-from-datastore.png"::: 

1. Give your new dataset the unique name e.g. **sodaObjects** that reflects the images captured in support of the detection task and select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-basic-info.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the from datastore option is highlighted." lightbox="../media/2-basic-info.png"::: 

1. Under **Datastore selection**, choose the datastore name that you added previously which contains the untagged image data. Here, you can also provide a wildcarded path if you wish to pull only images from specified partitions. If you wish to pull all images from the container, enter / as the path and select **Next**. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-datastore-selection.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Datastore selection options." lightbox="../media/2-datastore-selection.png"::: 

1. **Confirm details** about your new dataset and select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-confirm-details.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the confirm details section." lightbox="../media/2-confirm-details.png"::: 

1. Choose the newly created dataset, then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-select-dataset.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the newly created dataset has been chosen." lightbox="../media/2-select-dataset.png"::: 

1. You will be prompted to Enable incremental refresh at regular intervals. This will automatically add newly captured images to your data labeling project. Enable this option as shown, then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-enable-refresh.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the incremental refresh option is enabled." lightbox="../media/2-enable-refresh.png"::: 

1. On the next panel, add label classes for all objects or defects you wish to detect - include positive and negative classes here.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-label-classes.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the list of label classes." lightbox="../media/2-label-classes.png"::: 

1. You may optionally add labeling instructions in the following section, we will leave this empty and select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/2-labeling-instructions.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the labeling instructions options." lightbox="../media/2-labeling-instructions.png"::: 

1. You can optionally use **ML assisted labeling** which will accelerate your data labeling process, particularly as more data is captured. For this Learning Module, we wonâ€™t be using this option.  Disable the option as shown then select **Create project**.
