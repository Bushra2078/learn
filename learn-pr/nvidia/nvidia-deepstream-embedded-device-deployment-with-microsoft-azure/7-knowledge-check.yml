  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which components are included in any given Azure IoT Edge Solution'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The IoT Edge runtime and an Azure Container Registry'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The IoT Edge runtime is a necessary component, but an Azure Container Registry is technically optional as you could distribute a module from a public registry like DockerHub.
    - content: 'IoT Hub and the DeepStream Graph Composer'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The IoT Hub is only a part of the necessary cloud-based interface that makes up an Azure IoT Solution and the DeepStream Graph Composer is an application development tool provided by NVIDIA that is not a component of any Azure IoT Edge Solution.
    - content: 'IoT Edge modules, the IoT Edge runtime, and a cloud-based interface'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These are the three components that make up any Azure IoT Edge based solution.
  - content: 'Building cross-platform images with `container-builder` requires the following steps have been performed on the host machine:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Nothing, the container runtime will configure itself and just work'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Unfortunately this capability will not work without performing extra configuration steps
    - content: 'Install the `qemu-user-static` and `binfmt-support` packages then running an instance of the `multiarch/qemu-suser-static` image with appropriate configuration flags'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These are the proper steps to enable support for building cross-platform images with `container-builder`.
    - content: 'Install the `qemu-user-static` and `binfmt-support` packages'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This will install the necessary dependencies to enable cross-platform support in `container-builder` but still requires an extra step to configure support on the host.
  - content: 'What steps were required to configure a deployment specification for our DeepStream Graph workload in the Azure portal:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Add the DeepStream Module to the IoT Hub and deploy'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  Modules can be added to the deployment specification for a particular device that is stored by the IoT Hub, but modules are never added to the IoT Hub itself.
    - content: 'Register an IoT Edge device in the IoT Hub, provide access credentials to the Azure Container Registry that stores our workload, create a new module entry for the DeepStream workload, create the actual deployment'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These are the steps that we followed to configure a deployment specification for our DeepStream Graph workload.
    - content: 'Build the app in the DeepStream Graph Composer then publish to an IoT Hub with `container-builder`'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: '`container-builder` packages DeepStream Graph Composer graphs into an OCI-compatible container image.  From there, the image may be published to a container registry.'
