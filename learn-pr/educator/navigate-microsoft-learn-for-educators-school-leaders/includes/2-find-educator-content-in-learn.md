As the Microsoft Educator center merges with Microsoft Learn it will become the single training hub to empower digital classrooms.

## Modules and learning paths

Most of our training content is in the form of *modules*, which are organized into a series of *learning paths*. Modules are shorter courses, typically 30-60 minutes, that consist of pages called units. Learning paths are a series of modules centered around mastery of a particular topic. If you came from MEC, a module is the equivalent of a course and a learning path is the equivalent of a learning path.

## Browse and search for educator content

Learn has thousands of modules and learning paths to help you get started with Microsoft products. To browse content, go to the [Microsoft Learn "browse all" page](/learn/browse/).
