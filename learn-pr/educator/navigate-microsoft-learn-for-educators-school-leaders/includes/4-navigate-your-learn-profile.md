## Adding and removing accounts

One important benefit of Learn is that you can have multiple Microsoft accounts associated with your Learn profile. Do you have a personal and school account that you wish to separate? Have you moved to another school district and need to merge your old account with your new account?

No problem, you can do this in the account management area of your settings. To find this setting:

1. Navigate to your avatar image.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Then choose either **+Add account** or **Remove account**.

## Badges, trophies, and reputation points

Badges and trophies are your reward for finishing a module or learning path. All content for educators and school leaders earns this reward upon completion and passing the knowledge check.

Keep going on in this module and as you’ll see, you will earn yourself a badge.

Of note, you can also earn experience points (XP) and “level up” the longer you spend in Learn.
