  questions:
  - content: "Which command orders by a column in descending order?"
    choices:
    - content: "df.orderBy(\"requests desc\")"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This method is incorrect and will fail."
    - content: "df.orderBy(\"requests\").desc()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The desc() method on the DataFrame does not exist."
    - content: "df.orderBy(col(\"requests\").desc())"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Use the desc() method on the Column Class to reverse the order."
  - content: "Which command specifies a column value in a DataFrame's filter? Specifically, filter by a productType column where the value is equal to book?"
    choices:
    - content: "df.filter(col(\"productType\") == \"book\")"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This approach is the correct way to apply the filter, by using the Column Class."
    - content: "df.filter(\"productType = 'book'\")"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This syntax is incorrect. You cannot apply a column-level filter in this way."
    - content: "df.col(\"productType\").filter(\"book\")"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This syntax is incorrect. There is no col method on a DataFrame."
  - content: "When using the Column Class, which command filters based on the end of a column value? For example, a column named verb and filtered by words ending with \"ing\"."
    choices:
    - content: "df.filter().col(\"verb\").like(\"%ing\")"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This syntax is incorrect."
    - content: "df.filter(\"verb like '%ing'\")"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This syntax is incorrect."
    - content: "df.filter(col(\"verb\").endswith(\"ing\"))"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Column Class supports both the endswith() method and the like() method (example - col(\"verb\").like(\"%ing\"))."
