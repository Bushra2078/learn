In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **06-DataFrame-Column-Operations** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2.DataFrame-Column-Expressions** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Continue exploring the `DataFrame` set of APIs.
- Continue to work with the `Column` class and introduce the `Row` class
- Execute the transformations...
  - `orderBy(..)`
  - `sort(..)`
  - `filter(..)`
  - `where(..)`
- Execute the actions...
  - `collect()`
  - `take(n)`
  - `first()`
  - `head()`

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
