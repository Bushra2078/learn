Unsurprisingly, the role of a data scientist primarily involves exploring and analyzing data. The results of this analysis might form the basis of a report or a machine learning model; but it all begins with data.

> [!NOTE]
> Machine learning is a subset of data science that deals with predictive modeling. In other words, using data to create models that can predict unknown values. It works by identifying relationships between data values that describe characteristics of something (its *features*) and the value we want to predict (the *label*), and encapsulating these relationships in a model through a *training* process.

Usually, a data analysis project is designed to establish insights around a particular scenario or to test a hypothesis. For example, suppose a university professor collects data from data science students, including the number of lectures attended, the hours spent studying, and the final grade achieved on the end of term exam. The professor could then take a sample of the data and analyze it to determine if there is a relationship between the amount of study a student undertakes and the final grade they achieve. They might use the data to test a hypothesis that only students who study for a minimum number of hours can expect to achieve a passing grade; or even prepare the data to train a machine learning model that predicts a student's grade based on their study habits.
