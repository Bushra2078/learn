In this module, you learned how to use Python to explore, visualize, and manipulate data. Data exploration is at the core of data science, and is a key element in data analysis and machine learning.

In the hands-on exercise in this module, you used a Jupyter notebook in an Azure Machine Learning workspace. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service that you can use to run data experiments, and create and manage machine learning solutions. After completing the [Create machine learning models](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-machine-learn-models/) learning path, you can learn more about Azure Machine Learning in the following learning paths:

- [Create no-code predictive models with Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-no-code-predictive-models-azure-machine-learning/)
- [Build AI solutions with Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/)
