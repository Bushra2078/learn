Data ingestion is the process used to load data from one or more sources into a data store. Once ingested, the data becomes available for use. Data can be ingested using batch processing or streaming, depending on the nature of the data source.

Organizations often have numerous, disparate data sources. To deliver a full cloud solution, it's important to have a flexible approach to data ingestion into an Azure data store. Azure offers many ways to ingest data.

In this module, you'll explore some of these tools and techniques that you can use to ingest data with Azure.
