  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which component of an Azure Data Factory can be triggered to run data ingestion tasks?"
    choices:
    - content: "CSV File"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Even though a CSV file can be imported or exported, it cannot be run without an orchestration framework."
    - content: "Pipeline"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Pipelines can be triggered to run activities for ingesting data."
    - content: "Linked service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A linked service specifies the connection parameters for connecting to an Azure service. It's not a task that you can run."

    choices:
    - content: "To query data from external data sources from Azure Synapse Analytics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This is the purpose of PolyBase"
    - content: "To ingest streaming data using Azure Databricks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. PolyBase enables you to access external static data in Azure SQL Database queries"
    - content: "To orchestrate activities in Azure Data Factory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You use Data Factory pipelines to orchestrate activities."
  - content: "Which of these services can be used to ingest data into Azure Synapse Analytics?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Factory"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Data Factory can be used to ingest data into Azure Synapse Analytics from almost any source."
    - content: "Power BI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Power BI is an analytics tool that can be used to report on the data within Azure Synapse Analytics."
    - content: "Azure Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Active Directory is an authentication mechanism, not a data ingestion framework."
