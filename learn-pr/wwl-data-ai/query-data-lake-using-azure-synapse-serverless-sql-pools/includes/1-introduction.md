Azure Synapse Analytics includes serverless SQL pools, which are tailored for querying data in a data lake. With a serverless SQL pool you can use SQL code to query data in files of various common formats without needing to load the file data into database storage. This capability helps data analysts and data engineers analyze and process file data in the data lake using a familiar data processing language, without the need to create or maintain a relational database store.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify capabilities and use cases for serverless SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics
- Query CSV, JSON, and Parquet files using a serverless SQL pool
- Create external database objects in a serverless SQL pool
