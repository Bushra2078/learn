As a data scientist, you want to focus your time on training machine learning models. You want to easily get access of the data you need and have sufficient compute to train a model. To be efficient and cost-effective, you need to choose the appropriate service to train a machine learning model.

To decide which service best fits your needs, you need to know what type of model you're training. By understanding the requirements of your model, you can design a model training solution, which ensures the model keeps performing as expected and stays relevant over time.

You'll learn how to design a machine learning training solution and how to choose the tools you need to train a model.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Identify machine learning tasks.
- Choose a service to train a model.
- Choose between compute options.
