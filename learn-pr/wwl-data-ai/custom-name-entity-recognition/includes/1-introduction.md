Custom named entity recognition (NER), otherwise known as custom entity extraction, is one of the many natural language processing features offered by Azure Cognitive Services. Custom NER enables developers to extract pre-defined entities from text documents, without those documents being in a known format - imagine legal agreements or online ads.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the Language service to extract entities from unstructured documents.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand custom named entities and how they're tagged
- Build a Language service project
- Tag data, train, and deploy an entity extraction model
- Submit extraction tasks from your own app
