Azure Databricks supports machine learning frameworks other than Spark ML and MLLib. For example, Azure Databricks offers support for popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

It is possible to install these libraries directly, but the best recommendation is to use the [Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning](/azure/databricks/runtime/mlruntime). This runtime comes with various machine learning libraries pre-installed, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and XGBoost. It also includes libraries essential for distributed training, allowing data scientists to take advantage of the distributed nature of Apache Spark.

For libraries, which do not support distributed training, it is also possible to use a [single node cluster](/azure/databricks/clusters/single-node). For example, [PyTorch](/azure/databricks/applications/machine-learning/train-model/pytorch#use-pytorch-on-a-single-node) and [TensorFlow](/azure/databricks/applications/machine-learning/train-model/tensorflow#use-tensorflow-on-a-single-node) both support single node use.
