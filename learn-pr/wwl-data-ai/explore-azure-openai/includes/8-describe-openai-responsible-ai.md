It is important to consider the ethical implications of working with AI systems. Azure OpenAI provides powerful natural language models capable of completing a variety of tasks and operating in several different use cases, each with their own considerations for safe and fair use. Teams or individuals tasked with developing and deploying AI systems should work to identify, measure, and mitigate harm.

Usage of Azure OpenAI should follow the six Microsoft [AI principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai?azure-portal=true):

- **Fairness**: Al systems should not make decisions that discriminate against or support bias of a group or individual.
- **Reliability and Safety**: Al systems should respond safely to new situations and potential manipulation.
- **Privacy and Security**: Al systems should be secure and respect data privacy.
- **Inclusiveness**: Al systems should empower everyone and engage people.
- **Accountability**: People must be accountable for how Al systems operate.
- **Transparency**: AI systems should have explanations so users can understand how they are built and used.

Transparency Notes are intended to help you understand how Microsoft's AI technology works, the choices system owners can make that influence system performance and behavior, and the importance of thinking about the whole system, including the technology, the people, and the environment.
