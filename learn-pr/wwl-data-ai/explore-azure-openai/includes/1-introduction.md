Suppose you want to help your team understand the latest artificial intelligence (AI) innovations in the news. Your colleagues have questions about several headline-making key words, such as *ChatGPT*, *OpenAI*, and *machine learning models*. They would like to evaluate the opportunities these innovations support and understand what is done to keep AI advancements ethical.

You share with your team that today, stable AI models are regularly put into production and used commercially around the world. For example, Microsoft's existing Azure AI services have been handling the needs of businesses for many years to date.

Recently, OpenAI, an AI research company, published a chatbot known as ChatGPT and an image generation application known as DALL-E. Both displayed AI capabilities many have not seen before. These technologies were built with AI models which can take almost any natural language input from a user and return a machine-created human-like response.

You share with your team that Azure OpenAI Service enables users to build enterprise-grade solutions with OpenAI models. With Azure OpenAI, users can summarize text, get code suggestions, generate images for a web site, and much more. This module dives into these capabilities.

## Capabilities of OpenAI AI models

There are three main categories of capabilities found in OpenAI AI models:  

| Capability | Examples |
|------|---------|
| *Generating natural language* | Such as: summarizing complex text for different reading levels, suggesting alternative wording for sentences, *and much more* |
| *Generating code* | Such as: translating code from one programming language into another, identifying and troubleshooting bugs in code, *and much more* |
| *Generating images* | Such as: generating images for publications from text descriptions *and much more* |
