When you understand the data in a dataset, you can extend and transform it using techniques that make it easy to analyze. In its most basic format, data does not reveal much useful information. When you apply sorting, filtering, and aggregate calculations, you can shape data to expose insights upon which critical business decisions are made.

- Describe the different types of data that comprise a dataset.
- Sort and filter data to answer a business question.
- Understand how derived data can be added to a dataset.
- Explore highlighted data to discover data hot spots.
