Our introductory scenario presented a problem with large data sources and different regional requirements.

We identified how to create a core dataset in Power BI Desktop to share with other analysts. Then introduced how to make changes to that model to create specialized datasets for the separate regions. Now, the data analysts can focus on their regional data, and users don't complain about report performance.

We also demonstrated how to use lineage view in Power BI service to understand how specific data sources, datasets, reports, and dashboards are related. Finally, we discovered additional management options for datasets and workspaces with the XMLA endpoint, even when using external tools.
