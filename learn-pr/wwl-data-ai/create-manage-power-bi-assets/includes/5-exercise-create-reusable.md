> A virtual machine containing the client tools you need is provided, along with the exercise instructions. Use the button above to launch the virtual machine. A limited number of concurrent sessions are available - if the hosted environment is unavailable, try again later. Alternatively, you can use these [setup instructions](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/DP-500-Azure-Data-Analyst/Instructions/labs/00-setup-environment.html) to create your own lab environment, and follow these [exercise instructions](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/DP-500-Azure-Data-Analyst/Instructions/labs/16-create-reusable-power-bi-artifacts.html).

When you finish the exercise, end the lab to close the VM.
