  questions:
  - content: "Which Intelligent Insights options provide SQL Insights?"
    choices:
    - content: "Log Analytics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Storing data in Azure Log Analytics allows you to gain further intelligence on the events in your database."
    - content: "Azure Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure storage stores the files as extended events, and they have to be analyzed using Azure SQL."
    - content: "Event Hubs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Event Hubs allows you to forward events to another consumer, but does not perform analysis."
  - content: "Which Performance Monitor counter reflects how long SQL Server expects to retain data in memory?"
    choices:
    - content: "Page Life Expectancy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. PLE is how long the engine expects a given page to live in memory."
    - content: "Processor Queue Length"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Process queue length is an indication of CPU pressure."
    - content: "Paging File Usage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Page file usage is an OS metric that indicates memory pressure in the OS."
  - content: "What tool should you use to see the sizes of your SQL Server databases running in an Azure virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "The SQL virtual machine resource provider"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The SQL virtual machine resource provider enhances manageability features for SQL Server running on Azure Virtual Machines."
    - content: "Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Monitor does not include data from within the VM resource."
    - content: "SQL Insights"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Intelligent Insights provide performance data, but does not include SQL Server information."
  - content: "Which extended event target counts how many times each specified event occurs?"
    choices:
    - content: "The *etw_classic_sync_target* target"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The *etw_classic_sync_target* target operates with Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to monitor system activity."
    - content: "The *event_file* target"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The *event_file* writes event session output from buffer to a disk file."
    - content: "The *event_counter* target"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The *event_counter* target counts how many times each specified event occurs."
