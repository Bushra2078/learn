  questions:
  - content: "You're creating a pipeline that includes two steps. Step 1 preprocesses some data, and step 2 uses the preprocessed data to train a model. What type of object should you use to pass data from step 1 to step 2 and create a dependency between these steps?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Datastore"
