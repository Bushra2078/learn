In Azure Machine learning, you run workloads as experiments that leverage data assets and compute resources. In an enterprise data science process, you'll generally want to separate the overall process into individual tasks, and orchestrate these tasks  as *pipelines* of connected steps. Pipelines are key to implementing an effective Machine Learning Operationalization (ML Ops) solution in Azure, so you'll explore how to define and run them in this module.

> [!NOTE]
> The term *pipeline* is used extensively in machine learning, often with different meanings. For example, in Scikit-Learn, you can define pipelines that combine data preprocessing transformations with a training algorithm; and in Azure DevOps, you can define a build or release pipeline to perform the build and configuration tasks required to deliver software. The focus of this module is on Azure Machine Learning pipelines, which encapsulate steps that can be run as an experiment. However, bear in mind that it's perfectly feasible to have an Azure DevOps pipeline with a task that initiates an Azure Machine Learning pipeline, which in turn includes a step that trains a model based on a Scikit-Learn pipeline!

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Create an Azure Machine Learning pipeline.
- Publish an Azure Machine Learning pipeline.
- Schedule an Azure Machine Learning pipeline.
