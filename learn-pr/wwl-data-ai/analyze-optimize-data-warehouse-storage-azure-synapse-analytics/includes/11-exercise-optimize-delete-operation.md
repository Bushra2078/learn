## Optimize Delete Operations

1. Check the number of transaction items for customers with ids lower than 900000 using the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT
        COUNT_BIG(*) as TransactionItemsCount
    FROM
        [wwi_perf].[Sale_Hash]
    WHERE
        CustomerId < 900000
    ```

2. DELETE is a fully logged operation. If you need to delete a large amount of data in a table or a partition, it often makes more sense to SELECT the data you wish to keep, which can be run as a minimally logged operation. To select the data, create a new table with [CTAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-develop-ctas). Once created, use RENAME to swap out your old table with the newly created table. Use the following CTAS query to isolate the transaction items that should be kept:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [wwi_perf].[Sale_Hash_v2]
    WITH
    (
        DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN,
        HEAP
    )
    AS
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        [wwi_perf].[Sale_Hash]
    WHERE
        CustomerId >= 900000
    ```

    The query should execute within about a minute. All that would remain to complete the process would be to delete the `Sale_Heap` table and rename `Sale_Heap_v2` to `Sale_Heap`.

3. Compare the previous operation with a classical delete:

    ```sql
    DELETE
        [wwi_perf].[Sale_Hash]
    WHERE
        CustomerId < 900000
    ```

    >[!Note]
    >The query will run for a potentially long time. Once the time exceeds significantly the time to run the previous CTAS query, you can cancel it (as you can already see the benefit of the CTAS-based approach).
