  questions:
  - content: "What would be the best approach to investigate if the data at hand is unevenly allocated across all distributions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Grouping the data based on partitions and counting rows with a T-SQL query."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A distributed table is stored across 60 distributions. Each compute node can have multiple partitions. Counting rows in a partition will not help to investigate the data size on a node."
    - content: "Using `DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED` to see the number of table rows that are stored in each of the 60 distributions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED` returns the number of table rows that are stored in each of the 60 distributions."
    - content: "Monitor query speeds by testing the same query for each partition."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A distributed table is stored across 60 distributions. Each compute node can have multiple partitions. Query performance in a partition will not help to investigate the data size on a node."
  - content: "To achieve improved query performance, which one would be the best data type considering the storage of text data that does not exceed 128 characters?"
    choices:
    - content: "`VARCHAR(MAX)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maximum data size is defined. Keeping the data type smaller will increase query performance."
    - content: "`VARCHAR(128)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Limiting the size of the data type and not using size variability will provide the best performance."
    - content: "`NVARCHAR(128)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Non-variable data types provide better performance."
  - content: "Which one is **NOT** a benefit of materialized views?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reducing the execution time for complex queries with JOINs and aggregate functions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Materialized views help to improve complex query performance. The more complex the query, the higher the potential for execution-time saving."
    - content: "The ability to redistribute a base table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data in a materialized view **can be** distributed differently from the base tables."
    - content: "Increased high availability and resiliency benefits."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Data in materialized views gets the same high availability and resiliency benefits as data in regular tables."
  - content: "What are the benefits of minimally logging SQL operations?"
    choices:
    - content: "Improved performance compared to fully logged operations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Correct. As much less information is tracked in the transaction log, a minimally logged operation performs better than a similarly sized fully logged operation."
    - content: "Increased I/O efficiency."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With a minimally logged operation, fewer writes go the transaction log, a much smaller amount of log data is generated, and so is more I/O efficient."
    - content: "Provide a better point-in-time restore capability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the database is damaged or lost when minimal logging is in effect, you cannot recover the database to the point of failure."
