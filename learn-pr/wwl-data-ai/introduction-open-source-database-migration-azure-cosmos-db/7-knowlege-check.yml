  questions:
  - content: "How is it possible that Cosmos DB supports several database systems?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cosmos DB has multiple database engines, one for each system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "To support multiple data models, Cosmos DB uses an API for each data model. The APIs provide projections of containers and items as familiar objects to that data model."
    - content: "Cosmos DB is identical for each system, but has multiple APIs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To support multiple data models, Cosmos DB uses an API for each data model. The APIs provide projections of containers and items as familiar objects to that data model."
    - content: "Cosmos DB dynamically rewrites queries for each system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "To support multiple data models, Cosmos DB uses an API for each data model. The APIs provide projections of containers and items as familiar objects to that data model."
  - content: "What is the most suitable API to create graph entities in Cosmos DB?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cassandra"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Gremlin is the Apache TinkerPop graph traversal language. The Gremlin API enables you to create graph entities in Cosmos DB."
    - content: "Azure Table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Gremlin is the Apache TinkerPop graph traversal language. The Gremlin API enables you to create graph entities in Cosmos DB."
    - content: "Gremlin"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Gremlin is the Apache TinkerPop graph traversal language. The Gremlin API enables you to create graph entities in Cosmos DB."
  - content: "Which Azure Cosmos DB deployment guarantees 99.999% availability?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cosmos DB systems with a local replica provide 99.999% availability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft provides a service level agreement that Cosmos DB systems with multiple regions as writeable endpoints will provide 99.999% availability."
    - content: "Cosmos DB systems with multiple regions as writeable endpoints provide 99.999% availability."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Microsoft provides a service level agreement that Cosmos DB systems with multiple regions as writeable endpoints will provide 99.999% availability."
    - content: "Cosmos DB systems that are read-only provide 99.999% availability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft provides a service level agreement that Cosmos DB systems with multiple regions as writeable endpoints will provide 99.999% availability."
  - content: "Latency is important to your organization. What is the guarantee for Cosmos DB read and write latency globally?"
    choices:
    - content: "< 0.1-ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cosmos DB guarantees less than 10-ms latency for indexed reads and for writes globally."
    - content: "< 1-ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cosmos DB guarantees less than 10-ms latency for indexed reads and for writes globally."
    - content: "< 10-ms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Cosmos DB guarantees less than 10-ms latency for indexed reads and for writes globally."
  - content: "What is the size limit of a logical partition?"
    choices:
    - content: "10-GB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It's important to select the correct key for the logical partition because each logical partition has a limit of 10-GB."
    - content: "100-GB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's important to select the correct key for the logical partition because each logical partition has a limit of 10-GB."
    - content: "Unlimited"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's important to select the correct key for the logical partition because each logical partition has a limit of 10-GB."
  - content: "What are hot partitions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Partitions that have exceeded their storage limit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hot partitions occur when you select your partition key poorly, resulting in queries disproportionately running against a small number of petitions."
    - content: "Partitions set to run in high-performance mode."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hot partitions occur when you select your partition key poorly, resulting in queries disproportionately running against a small number of petitions."
    - content: "Partitions that are hit by a disproportionately high number of queries."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Hot partitions occur when you select your partition key poorly, resulting in queries disproportionately running against a small number of petitions."
