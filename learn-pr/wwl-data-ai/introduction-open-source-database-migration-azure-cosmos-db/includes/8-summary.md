In your Internet of Things (IoT) technology company, you were using several different NoSQL database technologies on-premises, to host databases that support your products. Because your current company is the result of several mergers, you had a disparate range of database servers. You wanted to realize the benefits of cloud hosting these databases, and standardize on a single database technology, but without the need to recode one or more of your products. Because Azure Cosmos DB supports several commonly-used NoSQL APIs, it's an ideal candidate to host all of your telemetry databases.

In this module, you discovered the key features of Cosmos DB, learned about the Cosmos DB architecture and APIs, learned how to plan a NoSQL to Cosmos DB migration, learned about Cosmos DB throughput, and discovered the Cosmos DB partitioning architecture.

## Takeaways

In this module you learned how to:

- Describe the key features of Cosmos DB.
- Describe the Cosmos DB architecture and APIs.
- Plan a NoSQL to Cosmos DB migration.
- Plan Cosmos DB throughput.
- Choose an appropriate partitioning key.
