Azure Cosmos DB has many benefits over on-premises deployments of NoSQL databases. Not only does it offer excellent performance and functionality using the default SQL API, but it also provides an ever-increasing range of APIs to provide native interface for a range of NoSQL databases.

Suppose you work for a technology company that manufactures Internet of Things (IoT) devices for smart homes. You use NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra to store telemetry from these devices. Owners can access data for their own devices from these databases. Because your company has a history of acquisition, and has purchased companies that make complementary IoT devices, you have a mix of NoSQL databases in your organization. You'd like to standardize all these databases on Azure to provide the availability and scalability that you expect to need in the next few years. You want to investigate Cosmos DB as a solution for all your IoT telemetry databases.

As well as the features of Cosmos DB, in this module you will also learn about throughput, resource units, and partitioning.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to migrate databases from SQL, Cassandra, MongoDB, and other systems into Azure Cosmos DB.

## Learning objectives  

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the key features OF Cosmos DB.
- Describe the Cosmos DB architecture and APIs.
- Plan a NoSQL to Cosmos DB migration.
- Plan Cosmos DB throughput.
- Choose an appropriate partitioning key.
