Azure Databricks and the Spark engine provide optimizations necessary for working with Big Data. By now, you should understand the difference between an Action and a Transformation, know the difference between a Wide and Narrow Transformation, and be aware that your code is evaluated and optimized by the Catalyst Optimizer.
