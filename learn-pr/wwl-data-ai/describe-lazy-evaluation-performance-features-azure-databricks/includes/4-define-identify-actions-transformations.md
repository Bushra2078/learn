In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **05-Lazy-Evaluation-and-Performance** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2.Actions-and-transformations** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you'll:

- Define and identify actions
- Define and identify transformations

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
