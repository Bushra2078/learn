The best way to learn about building a bot with the QnA Service and the Azure Bot Service is to explore them for yourself.

## Before you start

[!INCLUDE [](../../includes/ai-fundamentals-lab.md)]

## Complete the exercise

1. Open the **11 - QnA Bot.ipynb** notebook in the **mslearn-ai900** folder in Visual Studio Code.

2. Read the information in the notebook, and run the code cells it contains in order.

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
