  questions:
  - content: "Your organization has an existing frequently asked questions (FAQ) document. You need to create a QnA Maker knowledge base that includes the questions and answers from the FAQ with the least possible effort. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an empty knowledge base, and then manually copy and paste the FAQ entries into it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you could do it this way, importing there's an option that requires less effort."
    - content: "Import the existing FAQ document into a new knowledge base."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can import question and answer pairs from an existing FAQ document into a QnA Maker knowledge base."
    - content: "Import a pre-defined chit-chat data source."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A pre-defined chit-chat data source is unlikely to include relevant question and answer pairs for your FAQ."
  - content: "You need to deliver a support bot for internal use in your organization. Some users want to be able to submit questions to the bot using Microsoft Teams, others want to use a web chat interface on an internal web site. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a knowledge base. Then create a bot for the knowledge base and connect the Web Chat and Microsoft Teams channels for your bot"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Microsoft Teams channel enables your bot to receive and respond to messages in Microsoft Teams, and the Web Chat channel enables interactions through a web chat interface."
    - content: "Create a knowledge base. Then create two bots that use the same knowledge base - one bot connected to the Microsoft Teams channel, and the other to the Web Chat channel."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A single bot can be delivered through multiple channels."
    - content: "Create two knowledge bases with the same question and answer pairs. Then create a bot for each knowledge base; one connected to the Microsoft Teams channel, and the other to the Web Chat channel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A single bot can be delivered through multiple channels."
