  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options is the name of an MLflow component?"
    choices:
    - content: "MLflow Framework"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. MLflow Framework is not an existing component of MLflow."
    - content: "MLflow Tracking"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. MLflow is made up of four key components: a Model component, which provides a standard for shaping models; a Model Registry, which allows registration and versioning of models; Projects, which package data science code; and Tracking, which retains information on the execution of data science code."
    - content: "MLflow Training"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. MLflow Training is not an existing component of MLflow."
  - content: "An **experiment** is best defined as which of the following statements?"
    choices:
    - content: "A collection of tests"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Test is not a term used in MLflow."
    - content: "A collection of runs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. An experiment is defined as a collection of runs. A run is defined as the execution of code for a data science task."
    - content: "A collection of notebooks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A notebook is a web-based interface to a document that contains code, descriptive text and visualizations."
  - content: "What are two necessary assets included in a MLflow project?"
    choices:
    - content: "A model and its metrics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A model can be the output of the code included in a project but is not a necessary asset."
    - content: "A Python script and an experiment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A project does include a file as an entry point, but not an experiment."
    - content: "A Python script and the environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A project is a method of packaging data science code which includes at least one entry point, which is a file such as a Python script, and details about the environment."
