A notebook is a web-based interface to a document that contains 
* Runnable code
* Descriptive text
* Visualizations

A notebook is a collection of runnable cells (commands). When you use a notebook, you are primarily developing and running cells.

Runnable cells operate on files and tables. These can be run in sequence, referring to the output of previously run cells.

To create a notebook, we can click on `Workspace`, browse into the desired folder, right click and choose `Create` then select `Notebook`.

A name should be given to the new notebook, and a default language to be used inside the code cells. A cluster has to be specified for running the code.

For runnable cells, the following programming languages are supported: Python, Scala, R, SQL.
You may choose the default language for the cells in a notebook. You may also override that language later.

The notebook editor opens with a first empty cell

By hovering the `Plus` button below the current cell or by choosing the top right menu options, we can change the contents of the notebook. We may add new cells, cut/copy/export the cell contents, run a specific cell.

We can override the default language by specifying the language magic command `%<language>` at the beginning of a cell. 

The supported magic commands are: 
* `%python`
* `%r`
* `%scala`
* `%sql`

Notebooks also support a few auxiliary magic commands:
* `%sh`: Allows you to run shell code in your notebook
* `%fs`: Allows you to use dbutils filesystem commands
* `%md`: Allows you to include various types of documentation, including text, images, and mathematical formulas and equations.
