Using the Bot Framework Composer presents some advantages when compared to creating a bot with the SDK and coding.

- Use of Adaptive Dialogs allow for Language Generation (LG), which can simplify interruption handling and give bots character.
- Visual design surface in Composer eliminates the need for boilerplate code and makes bot development more accessible.
- Time saved with fewer steps to set up your environment.
- The Composer bot projects contain reusable assets in the form of JSON and Markdown files that can be bundled and packaged with a bot's source code. The files can be checked into source control systems and deployed along with code updates, such as dialogs, language understanding (LU) training data, and message templates.

You can download and install the Bot Framework Composer from [/composer/install-composer](/composer/install-composer). The tool is under active development, and updates are available frequently.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bot Framework Composer is pre-installed in the lab environment provided for the exercise later in this module - you will update it to the latest available version in the exercise.
