Using the Bot Framework Composer presents some advantages when compared to creating a bot with the SDK and coding.

- Visual design surface in Composer eliminates the need for boilerplate code and makes bot development more accessible.
- Save time with fewer steps to set up your environment.
- Visualize Dialogs, allow for building portions of the bot's functionality and how to guide the conversation.
- Triggers are easily created to invoke a specific dialog, and enabling interruptions is handled by switching a value within a prompt.
- Composer enables saving of pieces of data to various scopes to remember things between dialogs or sessions.
- Test your bot directly inside Composer via embedded Web Chat.

You can download and install the Bot Framework Composer from [Install Bot Framework Composer](/composer/install-composer). The tool is under active development, and updates are available frequently.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bot Framework Composer is pre-installed in the lab environment provided for the exercise later in this module - you will update it to the latest available version in the exercise.
