Bot Framework Composer is an open-source visual authoring canvas for developers and multidisciplinary teams to build bots. Composer integrates language understanding services such as LUIS and QnA Maker and allows sophisticated composition of bot replies using Language Generation. Composer is built using the latest features of the Bot Framework SDK. Within Composer, you'll find everything you need to build a sophisticated conversational experience.

To learn more about the Bot Framework Composer, check out the [Bot Framework Composer documentation](/composer/).

The Bot Framework Composer makes creating a bot easier but you can also use a templated bot creation experience with the Virtual Assistant. While the Virtual Assistant is not covered in this course, you can find samples and documentation on the [Virtual Assistant GitHub repository](https://microsoft.github.io/botframework-solutions/overview/virtual-assistant-solution/).
