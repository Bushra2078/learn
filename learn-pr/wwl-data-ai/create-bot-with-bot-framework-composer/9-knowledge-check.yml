  questions:
  - content: "What purpose do Adaptive Dialogs server in the Bot Framework Composer?"
    choices:
    - content: "They allow you to adapt the bot to different programming languages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Bot Framework Composer does not require you to write code, nor does the Adaptive Dialog aid in different programming languages."
    - content: "They adapt to a user's specific interaction techniques such as speech recognition."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This it not the purpose of Adaptive Dialogs."
    - content: "Provide a mechanism to handle interruptions in the conversation flow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Use of Adaptive Dialogs allow for Language Generation (LG), which can simplify interruption handling and give bots character."
  - content: "What is the purpose of a trigger?"
    choices:
    - content: "Triggers tell the user when they can start to interact with the bot."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While triggers can be activated during parts of the conversation, they are not used to tell a user when they can interact with the bot."
    - content: "Triggers help direct the bot behavior and are used for situations where users request help or you need to handle custom events."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Triggers contain rules that direct the bot's actions for processing incoming messages. Triggers also help direct the bot behavior and are used for situations where users request help or you need to handle custom events."
    - content: "Triggers are responsible for interpreting what the user wants, based on the input."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Triggers do not interpret the user input. That is the job of a recognizer."
  - content: "What is the Language Generation Library?"
    choices:
    - content: "The LUIS integration code samples for using LUIS models with your bot."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The library does not contain code for integration with LUIS."
    - content: "A set of powerful templating and message formatting tools."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The library is a set of powerful templating and message formatting tools that let you include variation, conditional messages, and dynamic content. LG gives you greater control of how your bot responds to the user."
    - content: "The library that contains templates for using cards in your bot."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Card templates are used to generate visually appealing responses (cards) to the user in a conversation.  They do not generate language responses."
