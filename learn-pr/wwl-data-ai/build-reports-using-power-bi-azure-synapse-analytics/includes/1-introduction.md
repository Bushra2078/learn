In this lesson, you will learn how to integrate Power BI with your Azure Synapse workspace to build Power BI reports. You will create a new data source and Power BI report in Azure Synapse Studio. Then you will learn how to improve query performance with materialized views and result-set caching. Finally, you will explore the data lake with serverless SQL pools and create visualizations against that data in Power BI.

After completing the lesson, you will be able to:

* Integrate an Azure Synapse workspace and Power BI
* Optimize integration with Power BI
* Improve query performance with materialized views and result-set caching
* Visualize data with serverless SQL pools and create a Power BI report
