Speech recognition is concerned with taking the spoken word and converting it into a text representation, while speech synthesis is the process of converting text data to audible speech. Both of these tasks are supported by the Speech cognitive service.

You can find out more about the Speech service in the [service documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/).
