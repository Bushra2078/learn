*Clustering* is a form of machine learning that is used to group similar items into clusters based on their features. For example, a researcher might take measurements of penguins, and group them based on similarities in their proportions.

Clustering is an example of *unsupervised* machine learning, in which you train a model to separate items into clusters based purely on their characteristics, or *features*. There is no previously known cluster value (or *label*) from which to train the model.

## Scenarios for clustering machine learning models 

Clustering machine learning models are used in many industries. A few scenarios are:

* Cluster customer attribute data into segments for marketing analysis.  
* Cluster geographic coordinates into regions of high traffic in a city for a ride-share application.
* Cluster written feedback into topics to prioritize customer service changes.
