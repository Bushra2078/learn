  questions:
  - content: "How does differential privacy work?"
    choices:
    - content: "All numeric values in the dataset are encrypted and cannot be used in analysis."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. In a differential privacy solution, noise is added to the data when generating analyses so that aggregations are statistically consistent but non-deterministic; and individual contributions to the aggregations cannot be determined."
    - content: "Noise is added to the data during analysis so that aggregations are statistically consistent with the data distribution but non-deterministic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. In a differential privacy solution, noise is added to the data when generating analyses so that aggregations are statistically consistent but non-deterministic; and individual contributions to the aggregations cannot be determined."
    - content: "All numeric column values in the dataset are converted to the mean value for the column. Analyses of the data use the mean values instead of the actual values."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. In a differential privacy solution, noise is added to the data when generating analyses so that aggregations are statistically consistent but non-deterministic; and individual contributions to the aggregations cannot be determined."
  - content: "In a differential privacy solution, what is the effect of setting an epsilon parameter?"
    choices:
    - content: "A lower epsilon reduces the impact of an individual's data on aggregated results, increasing privacy and decreasing accuracy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. The lower the epsilon, the less impact an individual's data has on aggregated results, and therefore the risk of exposure is reduced."
    - content: "A lower epsilon reduces the amount of noise added to the data, increasing accuracy and decreasing privacy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The lower the epsilon, the less impact an individual's data has on aggregated results, and therefore the risk of exposure is reduced."
    - content: "Setting epsilon to 1 enables differential privacy; Setting it to 0 disables differential privacy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The lower the epsilon, the less impact an individual's data has on aggregated results, and therefore the risk of exposure is reduced."
