Azure SQL Database allows you to track and analyze the changes to your data using a feature called Temporal Tables. This feature requires that the tables themselves be converted to be temporal, which means the table will have special properties and will also have a corresponding history table. The Temporal Table feature allows you to use the history table to recover data that may have been deleted or updated. Recovering data from the history table is a manual process involving Transact-SQL, but could be helpful in certain scenarios such as if a user accidentally deletes important data that the business needs.
