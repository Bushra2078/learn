  questions:
  - content: "You need to implement a data processing solution that monitors a social media feed and counts the number of posts containing the the hashtag \"#datarocks\" per minute for real-time reporting. What kind of data processing is required?"
    choices:
    - content: "Batch processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The source is a continuous stream of data and the requirement is for real-time reporting. Batch processing would not be the best way to implement this functionality."
    - content: "Stream processing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Stream processing could be used to ingest the social media feed, aggregate the posts over one minute windows, and present the results in a real-time report."
    - content: "Offline processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The source is a continuous stream of data and the requirement is for real-time reporting. This requires the data processing solution to be running continuously, not offline."
  - content: "You need to process a stream of stock price data from a real-time stock market feed that is captured in an Azure Event Hub, filter the data to include only prices for a specific list of stocks, and store the filtered results in Azure SQL Database. Which service should you use to filter the data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Batch."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Batch does not provide stream querying functionality."
    - content: "Azure Storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Storage does not provide stream querying functionality."
    - content: "Azure Stream Analytics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Stream Analytics can be used to query a stream of data from Azure Event Hubs and store the results in Azure SQL Database."
  - content: "Which capability of Azure Synapse Analytics enables you to implement table-based stream processing for data in a data lake?"
    choices:
    - content: "Serverless SQL pool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Azure Synapse has support for serverless SQL pools, this is not used from stream processing."
    - content: "Spark pool and Delta Lake."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Delta Lake support in a Spark pool enables you to use a table as a streaming source or sink."
    - content: "Pipelines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Synapse pipelines are typically used to perform data ingestion and batch processing tasks."
