As an educator, you play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. Skilling our future generation is critical work. With the increasing demand for talent skilled in understanding and applying data and databases, the DP-900 Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone. This course may be your students' first introduction to these concepts and serves as a foundation for some of our more advanced courses. 

Before we begin, make sure you're using the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum. It's recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center](https://aka.ms/ldc) (LDC) at least quarterly. If you've not already done so, download the course materials from the LDC before continuing with this module.
