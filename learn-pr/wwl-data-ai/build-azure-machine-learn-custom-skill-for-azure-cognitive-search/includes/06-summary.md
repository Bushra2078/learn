In this module, you've seen how to use the custom `AmlSkill` to enrich a model created in AML studio. Then you built your own Azure Cognitive Search solution and enriched a sample car index with a predicted price.

If you'd like to learn more about enriching an index without AML studio, see  [Example: Build and deploy a custom skill with Azure Machine Learning](/azure/search/cognitive-search-tutorial-aml-custom-skill).
