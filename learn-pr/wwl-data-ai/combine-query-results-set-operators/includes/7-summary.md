Now that you have completed this module, you understand what SET operators are, and how they can be used with result sets. You can join two or more sets of results together, and compare result sets to each other to return common rows, or rows that appear in one result set but not the other. 

You have also learned how to use the APPLY operators, CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY.

Now that you have completed this module, you can:

- Use the UNION operator.
- Use the INTERSECT and EXCEPT operators.
- Use the APPLY operator.
