Entity recognition is one part of the Text Analytics set of APIs in Azure Cognitive Services.  Using pre-built entity types, such as Person, Location, Organization, and others, the service evaluates the content of documents and returns information related to these entities.  You can use Named Entity Recognition to identify personal and sensitive information in documents. Use the data to classify documents or redact them so they can be shared safely.
