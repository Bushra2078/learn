    choices:
    - content: "Links one entity to another of the same category."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Entity linking is not used to link entities in similar categories."
    - content: "Provide a Bing or Google search engine URL to identify the item in the entity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Entity linking does not generate URLs for search engines."
    - content: "Customize linked entities to your own organization's list of entity elements."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The entity linking feature helps to remove ambiguity that may exist around an identified entity. A document may contain an entity such as ARES, which could mean the Greek god of war or it could be an acronym for Amateur Radio Emergency Services. Text Analytics is not able to make this linking on its own. It requires a knowledge base, in the required language, to provide the necessary recognition."

    choices:
    - content: "Identifies the calling application."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Differentiate between multiple entries in the input and map them to the correct output values."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The ID attribute can be used when there are multiple entries in the document. It helps to identify the specific text portion where the entity was located. As an example, if the submitted request contains more than one entry for text, the ID is used to locate the entities for that text, within the results."
