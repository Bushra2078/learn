Running a successful Azure AI Search solution requires you to understand how to maintain its two primary workloads of indexing and querying. It's essential that the search solution is as cost effective as possible.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Use Language Studio to enrich Azure AI Search indexes
- Enrich an AI Search index with custom classes

> [!NOTE]
> This module assumes you already know how to create and use an Azure AI Search solution that includes built-in skills. If not, complete the [Create an Azure AI Search solution](/training/modules/create-azure-cognitive-search-solution/) module first.
