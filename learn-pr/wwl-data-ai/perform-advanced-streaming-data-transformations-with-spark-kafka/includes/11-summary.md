In this module, youâ€™ve learned when to use HDInsight with Kafka and Spark. You have also learned the benefits of using Kafka and Spark, and the added benefits of using them together in the same VNET. You then learned about the cluster architecture, the solution architecture, and viewed a sample scenario architecture. You then created a Kafka producer, streamed the Kafka data to a Jupyter notebook, defined a window, and then gathered data based on that window. Finally, you learned how mirroring can be used in disaster recovery, high availability, and migration scenarios.
