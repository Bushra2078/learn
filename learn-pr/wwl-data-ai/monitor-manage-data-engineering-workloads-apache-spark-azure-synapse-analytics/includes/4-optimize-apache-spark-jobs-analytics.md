Once you have checked the monitor tab within the Azure Synapse Studio environment, and feel that you could improve the performance of the run, you have several things to take in mind:

* Choose the data abstraction
* Use the optimal data format
* Use the cache option
* Check the memory efficiency
* Use Bucketing
* Optimize Joins and Shuffles if appropriate
* Optimize Job Execution

In order to optimize the Apache Spark Jobs in Azure Synapse Analytics, you need to take into account the cluster configuration for the workload you're running on that cluster. 
You might run into challenges where memory pressure (if not configured well, like not choosing the right size of executors), long running operations and tasks that might result in Cartesian operations. 
If you want to speed up the jobs, you'd have to configure the appropriate caching for that task, as well as checking joins and shuffles in relation to data skew. 
Therefore, it is so imperative that you monitor and review Spark Job executions that are long running or resource-consuming. 

Some recommendations in order for you to optimize the Spark Job might include the following:

**Choosing the data abstraction**

Some of the earlier Spark versions use RDDs to abstract the data. 
Spark 1.3 and 1.6 introduced the use of DataFrames and Datasets. 
The following relative merits might help you to optimize in relation to your data abstraction:

**DataFrames**
Using DataFrames would be a great place to start. DataFrames provide query optimization through Catalyst. 
It also includes a whole-stage code generation with direct memory access. One thing to take in mind is that when you want to have the best-developer-friendly experience it might be better to use DataSets, since there are no compile-time checks or domain object programming. 

On that note, let's look into DataSets:
*DataSets are good in complex ETL pipelines optimization where the performance impact is acceptable.
Just be cautious when using DataSets in aggregations, since it might impact the performance.
However, it will provide query optimization through Catalyst and is developer-friendly by providing object programming and compile-time checks. 
DataSets do add serialization/deserialization overhead and has a high GC overhead. 

Looking at RDDs we would advise as follows:
It is not necessary to use RDDs unless you want or need to build a new custom RDD. However, there is no query optimization through Catalyst as well as no whole-stage code generation and would still have a high GC overhead. The only way to use RDDs is that it needs SPark 1.x legacy APIs. 

When looking at your data format, spark provides many. 
Formats that you can use are csv, json, xml, parquet etc. 
It can also be extended by other formats with external data sources. 
A tip that might be useful is using parquet with snappy compression (which also happen to be the default in Spar 2.x.)
Why Parquet?
It stores data in a columnar format, is compressed and highly optimized in Spark, as well as, splittable in order to decompress. 

When it comes to the caching, there is a native built in Spark caching mechanism. 
It can be used through different methods like: `.persist()`, `.cache()`, and `CACHE TABLE`. 
When using small datasets, it might be effective.
In ETL pipelines where caching of intermediate results is necessary this might come in handy too. 
Just take in mind that is you need to do partitioning, the spark native caching mechanism might have some downsides. 
The reason for that is that a cached table won't keep the partitioning data. 

It is also imperative to understand how to use the memory efficiently. 
What you have to understand is that Spark operates by placing data in memory. 
Therefore, managing memory resources is an aspect of optimizing Spark jobs executions. 
The way to manage it, might be to check smaller data partitions and checking data size, types and distributions when you formulate a partitioning strategy. 
Another way to optimize is to consider Kryo data serialization: [Kryo data serialization](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo), versus the default Java serialization.
Always bear in mind though, to keep monitoring and tuning the Spark configuration settings. 

Another thing to look at might be bucketing. 

**Use bucketing**

Bucketing is almost the same as data partitioning. 
The way it differs is that a bucket holds a set of column values instead of one. 
It might work well when you partition on large (millions or more) values like product identifiers. 
A bucket is determined by hashing the bucket key of a row. 
The way bucketed tables are optimized is because it's because the metadata about how it was bucketed and sorted are stored. 

Some advanced bucketing features are:

* Query optimization based on bucketing meta-information.
* Optimized aggregations.
* Optimized joins.

However, bucketing doesn't exclude partitioning. 
They go hand in had. 
You can use partitioning and bucketing at the same time.

**Optimize joins and shuffles**

Sometimes, when you have a slower performance on join or shuffle jobs, it can be caused by data skew. 
What is data skew?
It's asymmetry in your job data. 
An example might be that a job only takes 20 sec regularly, however running the same job where data is joined and shuffled can take up hours. 
In order to fix that data skew, you can salt the entire key, or use an *isolated salt* for  only some subset of keys. 
Another option to look into might be the introduction of a bucket column and pre-aggregate in buckets first. 
However, there's more to causing slow joins, since it might be the join type. 
Spark uses the `SortMerge` join type. 
This type of join is best suited for large data sets, but is otherwise computationally expensive because it must first sort the left and right sides of data before merging them.
Therefore, a `Broadcast` join might be better suited for smaller data sets, or where one side of the join is much smaller than the other side. 

You can change the join type in your configuration by setting `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`, or you can set a join hint using the DataFrame APIs (`dataframe.join(broadcast(df2))`).

```scala
// Option 1
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", 1*1024*1024*1024)

// Option 2
val df1 = spark.table("FactTableA")
val df2 = spark.table("dimMP")
df1.join(broadcast(df2), Seq("PK")).
    createOrReplaceTempView("V_JOIN")

sql("SELECT col1, col2 FROM V_JOIN")
```

If you did decide to use bucketed tables, you will have a third join type, the `Merge` join. 
A correctly pre-partitioned and pre-sorted dataset will skip the expensive sort phase from a `SortMerge` join.
Another thing to take in mind is that the order of the different type of joins does matter, especially in complex queries. 
Therefore, it's advised to start with the most selective joins. 
In addition, try to move joins that increase the number of rows after aggregations when possible.

Looking at the sizing of executors in order to increase performance in your spark job, you could consider the Java garbage Collection Overhead (GC) overhead. 
* Factors to reduce executor size:
  * Reduce heap size below 32 GB to keep GC overhead < 10%.
  * Reduce the number of cores to keep GC overhead < 10%.

* Factors to increase executor size:
  * Reduce communication overhead between executors.
  * Reduce the number of open connections between executors (N2) on larger clusters (>100 executors).
  * Increase heap size to accommodate for memory-intensive tasks.
  * Optional: Reduce per-executor memory overhead.
  * Optional: Increase utilization and concurrency by oversubscribing CPU.

As a general rule of thumb when selecting the executor size:

* Start with 30 GB per executor and distribute available machine cores.
* Increase the number of executor cores for larger clusters (> 100 executors).
* Modify size based both on trial runs and on the preceding factors such as GC overhead.

When running concurrent queries, consider as follows:

* Start with 30 GB per executor and all machine cores.
* Create multiple parallel Spark applications by oversubscribing CPU (around 30% latency improvement).
* Distribute queries across parallel applications.
* Modify size based both on trial runs and on the preceding factors such as GC overhead.

As stated before, it's important to keep monitoring the performance, especially outliers, using the timeline view, SQL graph, job statistics etc. 
It might be a case where one of the executors is slower than the other, which most frequently happens on large clusters (30+ nodes). 
What you then might consider is to divide the work into more tasks such that the scheduler can compensate for the slower tasks. 

If there is an optimization necessary in relation to the optimization of a job execution, make sure you keep in mind the caching (an example might be using the data twice, but cache it).
IF you broadcast variables on all the executors you set up, due to the variables only being serialized once, you'll have faster lookups. 
In another case you might use the thread pool that runs on the driver, which could result in faster operations for many tasks.
