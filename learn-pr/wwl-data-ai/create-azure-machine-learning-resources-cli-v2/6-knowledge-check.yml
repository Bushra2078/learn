  questions:
  - content: "A machine learning engineer wants to set up a new Azure Machine Learning workspace. Which CLI (v2) command should be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "`az ml workspace list`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The `workspace list` command will list all the workspaces in a subscription."
    - content: "`az ml workspace show`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The `workspace show` command will show the details for a workspace."
    - content: "`az ml workspace create`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. The `workspace create` command will create a workspace."
  - content: "A data scientist wants to create an environment to run a Python script on a compute cluster. Using the `az ml environment create --file basic-env.yml` command, what should the file basic-env.yml contain?"
    choices:
    - content: "The environment name and version."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Amongst other things, the specification YAML file should include the environment name and version."
    - content: "The packages and libraries that need to be installed on the compute cluster to run the script."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The packages and libraries can be listed in the Conda environment file that is referred to in basic-env.yml."
    - content: "The type and size of the compute cluster that needs to be created."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The configuration for the compute cluster can also be specified in a YAML file, but is then created with the `az ml compute create` command."
