Existing containers can be migrated to and from autoscale using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. During the migration process, the system will automatically apply a request unit per second (RU/s) value to the container.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always change this RU/s value after the migration has occurred.
