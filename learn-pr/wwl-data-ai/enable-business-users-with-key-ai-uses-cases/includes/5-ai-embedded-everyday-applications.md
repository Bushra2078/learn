To truly realize the potential of AI, it’s essential to bring AI to every employee in ways that are relevant and meaningful to their work. 

Business users can take advantage of intelligent business applications like Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 that weave relevant AI capabilities into their existing workflows. Let’s take a look at some examples of these applications that can help anyone use AI to get more done.

## Business function AI

For horizontal functions like sales, marketing, customer service, and finance, organizations across industries can use AI to solve problems and gain insight. The first step is often with software-as-a-service (SaaS) AI solutions, which deliver results quickly and in a cost-effective way.

With powerful intelligence in their existing workflows, business users can be more proactive and effective in their core competences. 

Using a few of our Dynamics 365 AI offerings as examples, we’ll take a look at a few of the most powerful scenarios where AI is already having a proven impact:

Five icons with the title “Infused AI into your core processes” at the top. The icons are white with blue circular backgrounds and have a circular line going through them all, connecting them. The top left icon is a dollar symbol with a circular arrow around it. It has the subtitle “Commerce” to the left of it. The top right icon is a lightbulb with the subtitle “Marketing” to the right of it. The middle left icon shows two people and a speech bubble coming from the person on the right. It has the subtitle “Sales” to the right of it. The middle right icon shows a person with a headset on and the subtitle “Customer Service” to the right of it. The bottom middle icon is a gear with a circular line around it. The circular line is segmented into three parts. It has the subtitle “Operations” to the bottom left of it.

* **Operations:** Operations users can gain insights into how their customer use their products and services, helping them transform the way they develop, market, sell, and support them.
* **Commerce:** Commerce users can use AI insights to help them more effectively manage cashflows using payment recommendations, intelligent budget proposals, and cashflow forecasting. They can even use AI to better protect their e-commerce business—and their customers—against fraud.

With business applications that use AI as a core ingredient, users can bring together relationships, processes, and data across applications to gain increased visibility and control.

## Everyday AI 

There are also numerous AI capabilities that anyone can use to address the realities of the modern workplace like virtual communication and the overwhelming amount of information. For example, we’re putting AI to work in [Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/everydayai) apps that people use every day—like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and Office. With these intelligent productivity experiences, employees can collaborate and conduct meetings more effectively, focus their time on value-added work, and uncover timely insights to improve their work.

### Everyday AI for remote work

Virtual meetings are becoming more and more critical in most of our lives. While there’s no true replacement for in-person collaboration, there are new AI tools that can decrease pain points, increase human connection, and make virtual work more engaging. For example, intelligent experiences in Microsoft Teams like background blur and custom backgrounds can help meeting participants minimize the chances of disturbances appearing on their screen. Live captions help improve accessibility for meeting participants who are hard of hearing or have hearing loss, non-native English speakers, or even for those with a sleeping baby nearby. Business users can even leverage real-time noise suppression to reduce distractions such as loud typing or a barking dog.

### Everyday AI for focus

Whether working remotely or in a physical workplace, AI can also help employees focus their time and attention on what matters most. For instance, the Briefing email from Cortana compiles important information about upcoming meetings and outstanding tasks in Outlook. It also enables employees to set aside daily “focus time” to work uninterrupted with notifications silenced. In Outlook mobile, employees can use natural language to ask Cortana to read out their new emails and share any changes to their schedule—so they can catch up even when their hands are busy with other things.

### Everyday AI for productivity

Breakthroughs in AI technologies have also enabled the transformation of personal productivity in apps people use every day like PowerPoint, Word, and Excel. To help prepare more engaging presentations, users can take advantage of intelligent suggestions for slide designs. They can even rehearse the presentation and receive real-time feedback to improve pacing and limit filler words or culturally insensitive phrases. Writers can take advantage of intelligent suggestions to not only correct spelling and grammar but also rephrase entire sentences for more impact or clarity. Writers can also get intelligent suggestions for spelling out acronyms, putting numbers in real-world perspective, citing reference material, and even flagging potentially unoriginal language.

### Everyday AI for search

As the world’s information grows by around 60% every year, staying up to date and making sense of it all can be increasingly overwhelming.<sup>4</sup> Yet harnessing information has become the key to almost everything—from improving productivity to understanding customers and much more. AI-powered search experiences like Microsoft Search can help business users wade through this data to uncover more impactful insights and make better data-driven decisions. Microsoft Search enables users to search for people, files, sites, and more across their organizational data and public web data—all from within the Microsoft 365 products they’re already working in. Results are even personalized to each user to ensure relevance.

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. New AI tools and technologies are being released every day that can help business users be more effective and productive.
