Human beings are incredible. We have so many unique capabilities that no machine can replicate—creativity, empathy, inventiveness, and imagination. At Microsoft, we believe the right AI tools can amplify these capabilities to help everyone achieve more.

Business users in every industry can take advantage of a wide array of AI solutions. For example, subject matter experts like researchers and engineers can use AI to more effectively and efficiently apply their expertise. Using no-code tools and platforms, they can also create their own AI models or integrate a model into an app themselves, helping turn their visions into reality.

Let’s look at some examples of how anyone can work with and even create AI to achieve more.

## AI for reasoning

There are a huge variety of AI models available today. However, most workers only have access to models that have been embedded into applications for a specific purpose. In complex fields that require deep expertise, employees need the flexibility to pivot their approach if they have a new idea or new evidence to work with. Telling a developer or data scientist what they need ahead of time would be at best impractical and more likely impossible.

Real transformation happens when everyone can use a wide range of AI models to reason over complex, unstructured information. This means they can choose which AI models to use for different purposes and what information sources to analyze with them.

AI for reasoning is exactly that. It is highly valuable for people with business-critical expertise like researchers, operations managers, field technicians, marketers, business developers, and more. With powerful AI applications, they can apply their knowledge more efficiently and effectively, speed up learning cycle iterations, and deliver real business impact at a rate never before possible.

Three icons with the title: “AI for researchers and subject matter experts” at the top. There are three white icons with blue circular backgrounds each with their own subtitle below them. The top left icon is a person on the left with a lightbulb to the right of them. The lightbulb has lines around it showing that it is “turned on”. The icon has the subtitle “Empower experts” below it. The top right icon shows outlines of three people: the left and right people are in the background while the middle person is in the foreground. The icon has the subtitle “Enable AI collaboration” below it. The bottom middle icon is a globe with the subtitle “Drive enterprise-wide transformation” below it.

### Mackmyra

[Mackmyra Whisky](https://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/meet-the-worlds-first-ai-created-whisky/), a Swedish whisky distillery, uses AI for reasoning to help their Master Blenders take product quality to the next level. Mackmyra’s AI models used existing recipes, sales data, and customer preferences to generate more than 70 million new and innovative whisky recipes. Master Blenders evaluate, test, and refine the AI recommendations based on their expertise and deep knowledge of the craft. With the power of AI, they can innovate at a pace and with a level of detail that was previously unattainable.

## Build AI without code

There also may be times when business users want to create their own AI models or integrate a model into an app themselves. With no-code tools and platforms, now business users can add AI capabilities to their apps and automate their workflow—regardless of their technical expertise.

For example, let’s say a hotel manager wanted to use AI to analyze customer feedback to better understand how they could improve their customer service. The hotel manager could use no-code AI tools to create a model that can classify new customer feedback as they receive it.

We’ve even added these no-code capabilities to our popular [Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/). With [AI Builder](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder/), business users can train, publish, and run AI models using customizable templates and a guided process without writing a single line of code. They can also use pre-built models for common scenarios.

Prediction statistic with the title: “Low-code tools are becoming ubiquitous” at the top. In the middle of the graphic, there is a doughnut pie chart with 65% the chart shaded blue and the remaining 35% shaded a light gray. In the middle of the doughnut pie chart is “+65%” in bold. Below the chart is the subtitle “Gartner predicts that by 2024, over 65% of app development activity will come from low-code tools.”

Business users can leverage a wide range of customizable templates for training their own AI models including:

* **Form Processing** identifies the structure of your documents based on examples you provide to extract text from any matching form.  
* **Object Detection** lets you count, locate, and identify selected objects within any image. You can use this model in PowerApps to extract information from pictures you take with the camera.
* **Prediction** identifies patterns in historical data and then detects learned patterns in new data to predict future outcomes.

Business users can also take advantage of a range of pre-built AI models that require no training or customization. These prebuilt AI models include:

* **Business Card Reader** models allow for the extraction of information from business card images such as name, job title, address, email, company, and phone numbers.
* **Sentiment analysis** models detect positive or negative sentiment in text data and provide an overall sentiment score for each text data.
* **Text recognition** models extract words from digital, printed, and even handwritten documents and images into machine-readable character streams.

With democratized development platforms like AI Builder, those who best understand the business problems can create the right AI solutions to solve them. 

Next, let’s look at some examples of how business users can leverage AI already embedded in the applications they use every day.
