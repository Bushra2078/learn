AI can empower all people to achieve more, not just developers and data scientists. In fact, Gartner predicted that in 2021, artificial intelligence (AI) augmentation will create $2.9 trillion of business value and 6.2 billion hours of worker productivity globally.<sup>1</sup> Most of this enormous value will come from business users and subject matter experts working with AI.

Take Novartis as an example. Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company bringing the power of AI to the desktop of every employee. Its employees deal with a vast amount of information like biomedical publications, cellular imagery, molecular representations, gene sequences, and clinical trial results. With a range of AI models, employees can quickly make sense of and derive key insights from this information to take on the next wave of challenges in medicine.<sup>2</sup>

This is just one example. AI provides business users and subject matter experts with limitless opportunities to do things that weren’t possible before. With access to AI, they can uncover hidden insights, find critical information, improve collaboration, and even automate repetitive tasks.

Statistic with the title: “Employees want AI” at the top. In the middle of the figure, there is a doughnut pie chart. 91.7% of the doughnut pie chart is shaded blue with the remaining 8.3% shaded a light gray. In the middle of the chart is the text “91.7%” in bold. There is a subtitle below the chart with the following text: “Of employees are motivated to participate in AI reskilling.”

## The Microsoft perspective

At Microsoft, we’re working to ensure that any user—from accountant to researcher—can achieve more with AI. It shouldn’t require a background in data science to benefit from these experiences.

We believe AI should be used to enhance, not replace, human capabilities. The right AI tools will help employees better apply their expertise and complement it with AI-powered insights, making them more innovative and effective.

To accomplish this, we’re weaving intelligence into business applications that people use every day.

We also want to make it possible for anyone to add AI capabilities to apps, no matter their technical experience. We’re working to democratize AI development with no-code tools and platforms so business users can create their own AI models. We’re also making pre-built models for common scenarios accessible to non-developers.

Four icons with the title: “Microsoft AI available to business users” at the top. The top-left icon shows outlines of three people: the left and right people are in the background while the middle person is in the foreground. This icon has the subtitle “Everyday AI” below it. The top-right icon is a chart showing three triangles getting increasingly bigger with a dotted arrow imposed on the triangles from the bottom left of the chart to the top right. The icon has the subtitle “Business Function AI” below it. The bottom-left icon shows binary with a circle around it and a line through it. It has the subtitle “Build AI without Code” below it. The bottom-right icon is an outline of a light bulb with the subtitle “Reasoning AI”  below it.

Finally, we’re committed to advancing the responsible development and use of AI. We believe it’s critical to take a human-centered approach to AI development and governance. This approach should value diverse perspectives and emphasize listening, learning, and responding as technology evolves. Together, we can ensure the next generation of AI is designed, built, and used responsibly.

Up next, we’ll hear from Navrina Singh, current Co-Founder of Credo.ai and ex-Director of Product Management at Microsoft AI, as she discusses the benefits of scaling AI to everyone in an organization.
