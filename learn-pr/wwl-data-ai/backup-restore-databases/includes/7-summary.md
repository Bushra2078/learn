Without backups, you don't have high availability or disaster recovery. Features like AGs or active-geo replication don't replace a proper backup and recovery strategy. Backups must be tested via a restore otherwise your backups are just files that sit on a file system that checks a box somewhere that backups were generated.

Now that you've reviewed the module, you should be able to describe:

- Database backup and restore options for IaaS
- Virtual machine backup and restore options for IaaS
- Backup and restore options for PaaS
