  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How does backup to URL in SQL Server or Azure SQL Server Database Managed Instance store the backup file?"
    choices:
    - content: "As a URL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The URL just defines where the data is stored but not the storage."
    - content: "As a blob"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Backup to URL requires an Azure storage account and uses the Azure blob storage service."
    - content: "As a pointer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A pointer is not used in the backup process."
  - content: "Which platforms can an Azure Database for PostgreSQL database backup be restored to?"
    choices:
    - content: "PostgreSQL only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Similar to all other Azure PaaS offerings, these backups can only be used by Azure Database for PostgreSQL and not a standard installation of PostgreSQL."
    - content: "Azure Database for PostgreSQL only"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Similar to all other Azure PaaS offerings, these backups can only be used by Azure Database for PostgreSQL and not a standard installation of PostgreSQL."

    choices:
    - content: "Free up to the size of the database"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. One nice thing about the backups is that there is no cost; if a server is provisioned with 100 GB of storage, you get the equivalent amount of backup space included with what you are already paying."
    - content: "Double the cost of the service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. One nice thing about the backups is that there is no cost; if a server is provisioned with 100 GB of storage, you get the equivalent amount of backup space included with what you are already paying."
    - content: "Half the cost of the service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. One nice thing about the backups is that there is no cost; if a server is provisioned with 100 GB of storage, you get the equivalent amount of backup space included with what you are already paying."
