Custom text classification assigns labels, which in the Language service is a *class* that the developer defines, to text files. For example, a video game summary might be classified as "Adventure", "Strategy", "Action" or "Sports".

Custom text classification falls into two types of projects:

- **Single label classification** - you can assign only one class to each file. Following the above example, a video game summary could only be classified as "Adventure" or "Strategy".
- **Multiple label classification** - you can assign multiple classes to each file. This type of project would allow you to classify a video game summary as "Adventure" or "Adventure and Strategy".

When creating your custom text classification project, you can specify which project you want to build.
