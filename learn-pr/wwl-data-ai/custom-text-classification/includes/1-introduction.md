*Natural language processing* (NLP) is one of the most common AI problems, where software must interpret text or speech in the natural form that humans use. Part of NLP is the ability to classify text, and Microsoft Azure provides ways to classify text including sentiment, language, and custom categories defined by the user.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the Azure AI Language service to classify text into custom groups.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Define single and multiple label classifications
- Build a custom text classification project
- Label data, train, and deploy a model
- Submit classification tasks from your own app
