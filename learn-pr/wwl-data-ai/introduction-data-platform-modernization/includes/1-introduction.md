Data platform modernization is primarily focused on selecting and migrating to the right data platform technology that will help your business achieve its strategic objectives and goals.

You've been hired as a senior data engineer at a global retailer and you're working with a consultant and architects to initiate a data platform modernization project that meets the organization's technical and business requirements. The organization has a large number of different database systems that underpin business-critical functions such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), stock management, distribution, and human resources. As the company has grown by acquisition, database systems based on open-source and third-party databases have been brought into the responsibility of the IT department. The company now runs many different on-premises database servers with different version numbers and from different vendors. You'd like to standardize and modernize your databases throughout your organization but you don't know how much administrative and development work that aim will require.

In this module, you'll learn the purpose of data platform modernization and see the benefits it can bring to your organization. You'll then review the stages of a data platform migration project to see what's involved. Finally, you'll explore the various data platform technologies available. You'll understand how each approach is different, and why you would choose one migration approach over another.
