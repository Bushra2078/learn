  questions:
  - content: "Which property should you set, in Bicep, to establish a relationship between a container and its corresponding database?"
    choices:
    - content: "``name``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``name`` property does not establish a relationship in JSON or Bicep."
    - content: "``dependsOn``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``dependsOn`` property is used in JSON to establish a relationship between two resources."
    - content: "``parent``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The ``parent`` property establishes a relationship between two resources in Bicep."
  - content: "Which command should you use to deploy a Bicep or JSON template to Azure Resource Manager?"
    choices:
    - content: "``az deployment group create``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The ``az deployment group create`` command is the correct command to deploy both Bicep and JSON templates."
    - content: "``az group deployment create``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``az group deployment create`` command is deprecated and does not support Bicep deployments."
    - content: "``az bicep deploy``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``az bicep`` command group only contains commands relevant to building and decompiling Bicep files."
  - content: "You have an Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account name **adventureworksllc**, a database named **cosmicworks**, and a container named **products**. In a JSON Azure Resource Manager template, how do you specify the **name** property of this resource?"
    choices:
    - content: "``products``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``products`` name will not uniquely and correctly identify this resource."
    - content: "``adventureworksllc/cosmicworks/products``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The name of a container resource is defined in the ``<account>/<database>/<container>`` syntax."
    - content: "``databaseAccounts/adventureworksllc/sqlDatabases/cosmicworks/containers/products``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers`` is used to define the resource type, not the name."
