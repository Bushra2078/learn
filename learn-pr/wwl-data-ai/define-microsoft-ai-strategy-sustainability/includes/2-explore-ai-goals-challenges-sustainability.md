When you adopt AI in a sustainability project, what can you expect? What potential obstacles must you watch for?

The main goal for AI projects in sustainability is to build a **better, fairer world and economy**. As the use cases and success stories in this module show, AI is a powerful tool to achieve greener energy, transportation, industrial production, and so on. AI is especially good at optimizing processes, and so it can help sustainability professionals achieve more with less effort.

However, AI initiatives face a major challenge: **energy**. AI is increasing consumption demands. An AI-powered sustainability solution can be counterproductive if its bad design requires a high carbon footprint. On the other hand, a well-designed AI system optimizes energy efficiency, and the Microsoft Azure environment has specific features for this purpose. For example, you can optimize workloads using cloud instances in different geographic regions or at different times of day.<sup>1</sup> Besides, it’s equally important to fuel data hubs with green energy. Microsoft is working on this task as well though several initiatives.<sup>2</sup> This goal is related to Microsoft commitment to become a carbon-negative, water-positive, zero-waste company by 2030. The organization is on track to meet this promise.<sup>3</sup>

In the following video, Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer at Microsoft, discusses how Microsoft is pursuing these sustainability goals.
