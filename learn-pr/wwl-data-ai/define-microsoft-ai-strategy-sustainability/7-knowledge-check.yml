  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the biggest challenge in AI systems for sustainability and how can organizations deal with it?"
    choices:
    - content: "AI systems tend to be pollutant. You should minimize their use in sustainability solutions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it’s true that AI systems sometimes have a high carbon footprint because of an elevated energy consumption, there are strategies to avoid this risk. On the contrary, AI is a powerful tool to enable scenarios that reduce pollution."
    - content: "Sustainability scenarios often require highly technical expertise on climate science, ecology, and so on. You should focus on automating less technical tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI can be helpful in all sorts of scenarios, even those requiring technical expertise, such as identifying wildlife species or estimating how much pesticide your crop needs."
    - content: "AI systems might consume too much energy. They must be optimized to be efficient and fueled by green energy if possible."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A bad design can make an AI sustainability solution waste too much energy. Remember that Microsoft Azure has features to minimize energy consumption with optimal performance."
  - content: "Which sustainability use cases enable each of these Microsoft products?"
    choices:
    - content: "Organizations can implement crop health monitoring systems with FarmVibes.AI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The FarmVibes project offers these AI models for this purpose. You can also use them to monitor soil health."
    - content: "Companies can use Microsoft SynapseML to get data analytics of water consumption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft SynapseML serves a different purpose: helping you build a fully scalable, distributed AI system. Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability includes specific feature water consumption analytics."
    - content: "Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability detects solar and wind energy installations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Microsoft tool with that feature is the Global Renewables Watch. Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability enables other scenarios, such as reducing environmental impact of facilities, obtaining data analytics of water consumption, or improving mobility with optimized routes and logistics."
  - content: "In the Nearshore Habitat program, which functions do these Microsoft AI products fulfill?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Machine Learning performs video classification by ingesting short clips of video footage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn’t the workflow of the solution. The videos are split into frames, which are analyzed by Azure AI Services image recognition models. Azure Machine Learning serves to store, manage, and deploy these AI models."
    - content: "Microsoft Power BI cleans the data before feeding it to the AI models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data, that is, the video footage, needs to be split into frames before getting to the AI models. This task isn’t performed by Microsoft Power BI, whose function is to extract insights of the results obtained by the AI models."
    - content: "The AI system relies on Azure AI Services to classify and identify seagrass species."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AI Services includes image recognition models that can be taught to identify eelgrass."
