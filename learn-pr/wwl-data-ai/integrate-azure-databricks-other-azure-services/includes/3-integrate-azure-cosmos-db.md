In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **14-Integrating-with-other-Azure-Services** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2.Cosmos-DB** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Write data into Azure Cosmos DB.
- Read data from Azure Cosmos DB.

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
