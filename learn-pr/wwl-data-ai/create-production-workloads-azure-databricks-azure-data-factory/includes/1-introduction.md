Imagine you're part of an analytics team that needs to build a new data pipeline that involves copying data from multiple sources into a data lake for processing. You use Azure Databricks to transform the data, and you want to ensure your processing occurs as soon as the data is ready. Processing the data from a notebook is just one step of the data pipeline. Your team conducted research on orchestration platforms and has decided to use Azure Data Factory, given its ability to connect to several services both on-premises and in the cloud, and to easily build data pipelines.

Your supervisor requested that you investigate the ability to execute Azure Databricks jobs from Azure Data Factory, passing in parameters used for data processing, and returning parameters used to continue the pipeline processing.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Create an Azure Data Factory pipeline with a Databricks activity.
- Execute a Databricks notebook with a parameter.
- Retrieve and log a parameter passed back from the notebook.
- Monitor your Data Factory pipeline.

## Prerequisites

None.

You can use Azure Data Factory to ingest data collected from different sources and coordinate processing jobs in Azure Databricks as part of your data pipeline.

## What is Azure Data Factory?

Azure Data Factory is a data ingestion and transformation service that allows you to load raw data from over 70 different on-premises or cloud sources. The ingested data can be cleaned, transformed, restructured, and loaded back into a data warehouse. After the data is in the data warehouse, it's ready to use for several analytical purposes.

Data Factory supports data workflow pipelines. These pipelines are a logical group of tasks and activities that allows end-to-end data-processing scenarios.
