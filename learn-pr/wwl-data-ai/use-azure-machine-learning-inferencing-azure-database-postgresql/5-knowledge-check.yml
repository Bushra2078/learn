quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "We want to estimate the nightly rental price of a property based on various factors, such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location. Which of the following is the best type of machine learning model to use for this scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The goal of a classification model is to predict a category or class label. In this case, we want to predict a continuous value, the nightly rental price."
    - content: "Clustering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The goal of a clustering model is to group similar data points together. In this case, we want to predict a specific value given some set of inputs."
    - content: "Regression."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The goal of a regression model is to predict a specific value given some set of inputs. In this case, we want to predict the nightly rental price of a property, which is a continuous value."
  - content: "Which of the following settings do we need to configure in Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server to support calling an Azure Machine Learning model?"
    choices:
    - content: "`azure_cognitive.subscription_key`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `azure_cognitive` schema is used for calling Azure Cognitive Services, not Azure Machine Learning."
    - content: "`azure_ml.subscription_key`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no `subscription_key` setting for Azure Machine Learning."
    - content: "`azure_ml.scoring_endpoint`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `azure_ml.scoring_endpoint` setting is used to specify the endpoint for the Azure Machine Learning model that we want to call."
  - content: "In the call to `azure_ml.inference()`, what is the data type of the `input_data` parameter?"
    choices:
    - content: "jsonb."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `input_data` parameter should be a JSON object in binary representation that contains the input data for the Azure Machine Learning model."
    - content: "json."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `input_data` parameter should be a JSON object, but not one stored in plain text format."
    - content: "text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `input_data` parameter must be in a JSON format."
