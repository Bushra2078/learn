You will also create an [Azure Machine Learning workspace](/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources) and train a model using Azure ML's automated machine learning (AutoML) capabilities. Finally, you will create a function in PostgreSQL to estimate a rental property's nightly listing price based on data in your PostgreSQL database.
