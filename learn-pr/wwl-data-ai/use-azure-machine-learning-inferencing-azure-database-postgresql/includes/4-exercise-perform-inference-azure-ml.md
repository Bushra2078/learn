In this exercise, you install the `azure_ai` extension in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server. You also create an [Azure Machine Learning workspace](/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources) and train a model using Azure Machine Learning's automated machine learning capabilities. Finally, you create a function in PostgreSQL to estimate a rental property's nightly listing price based on data in your PostgreSQL database.
