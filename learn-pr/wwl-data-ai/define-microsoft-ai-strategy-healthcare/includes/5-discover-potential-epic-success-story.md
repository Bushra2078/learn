Epic provides a good example of how health providers can implement AI solutions to deliver a better service to patients. Their partnership with Microsoft plays a key role in enabling these AI projects in a solid, responsible way. Let’s discover their success story.

## The organization

Epic is a software company that develops EHR systems. Their products serve patients and all kinds of healthcare centers, such as hospitals, dental clinics, academic medical centers, and more. It’s based in Wisconsin (United States), where it started as just three people working in a basement. Now, more than 305 million patients have their health data on Epic software. Epic is dominant across the United States and has a strong international presence.

Innovation is a priority for Epic. To achieve it, they invest 38 percent of operating expenses in R&D. This innovative culture makes them leaders in healthcare IT. For years, Epic and Microsoft have been partners. Thanks to this collaboration, you can use Epic software on the Microsoft Azure platform.

## The challenge

In the last period, the healthcare industry has faced workforce shortages and burnout,<sup>3</sup> increased labor expenses, supply disruptions, the impact of inflation, and overall losses and operating margin decline.<sup>4</sup> This context makes increasing productivity and technological efficiency a top priority for businesses in the sector. Epic decided to rise to this challenge with Microsoft AI.

## The solution

Epic trusted they could improve productivity by adding generative AI into their EHR software. They decided Azure OpenAI Services was the best fit for Epic, since it delivers the most powerful OpenAI models over the robust, reliable infrastructure of Microsoft Azure. Epic chose two different use cases to implement this product in their EHR systems.

### Epic In Basket: more agile conversations with draft responses

The first initiative is Epic In Basket, a solution that uses generative AI to help doctors when communicating with patients via chat. Azure OpenAI Services automatically creates draft responses for physicians to answer more efficiently. This system is now implemented in several healthcare centers, such as UC San Diego Health, UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin, and Stanford Health Care.

### An assistant for smart analysis in Slicer Dicer

The second generative AI project developed by Epic and Microsoft focuses on Slicer Dicer, Epic’s self-service reporting and data visualization tool. The goal of this project is to empower clinical leaders. The solution adds a new feature to Slicer Dicer that suggests metrics based on search criteria. Employees can interact with this assistant in a conversational and more natural way. This copilot approach enables users to get more out of data and to do it more efficiently.

## The results
Epic’s clients are already reporting positive outcomes. The initiatives are simplifying daily work routines, and so increasing productivity. Now, professionals can allot more time and resources to the medical duties that are the core of their business. Likewise, the improvements in Slicer Dicer are helping analysts identify operational improvements. For example, they’re finding clever ways of reducing costs.
