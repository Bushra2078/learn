Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) allows your application to understand what people want in their own words. With LUIS, you can build applications that receive user input in natural language and extract meaning from it.

In this module, you created a simple LUIS application. You then added some intents, utterances, and entities to test how it interacts with a user. The idea behind building this LUIS application was to integrate it into a bot application. To integrate LUIS into your own AI applications, use the API documentation to understand how to do that integration.
