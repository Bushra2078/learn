  questions:
  - content: "In a LUIS app, what's the purpose of an utterance?"
    choices:
    - content: "An utterance represents a task or action that the user wants to do."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In LUIS terminology, an intent represents a task or action."
    - content: "An utterance represents a word or phrase inside an intent."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An entity represents a word or phrase inside an utterance. Entities are used to provide context for determining the user's intent."
    - content: "Utterances are input from the user that your app needs to interpret."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An utterance is a phrase a user might use to interact with the application, such as, \\\"Book a flight to New York\\\"."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the None intent?"
    choices:
    - content: "The None intent is used when a user sends null requests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Null requests aren't technically relevant when interacting with a LUIS app."
    - content: "Random utterances that donâ€™t map to any of your intents can be mapped to None."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The None intent serves as a catchall for utterances that don't map to existing intents."
    - content: "The None intent is used to remove spaces from the beginnings and endings of utterances."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no need to remove blank spaces from utterances that are sent to the application."
  - content: "What is the preferred option when needing an entity to represent currency?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a new entity and set the decimal places to high-precision."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is not an option in LUIS."
    - content: "Use a prebuilt entity for currency."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Rather than trying to manage common types of information yourself, you should use the prebuilt entities included with LUIS."
    - content: "Select the Numbers prebuilt entity and choose the currency format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is not an option in LUIS for prebuilt entities."
