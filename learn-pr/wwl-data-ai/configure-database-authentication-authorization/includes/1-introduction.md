Azure SQL Database has several authentication and authorization options which are different from the options in SQL Server. This is because Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance rely on Azure Active Directory instead of Windows Server Active Directory.

This module explores the practices of granting permissions and what the various permissions do within a database. This module also explores the concept of “least privilege”. While the built-in roles in SQL Server and other database engines provide broad brushes of security privileges, many applications need more granular security on database objects.
