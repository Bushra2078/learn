In this module, you learned how to configure security for your Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL server. You saw how the server automatically backs up data, and how you can restore a server after a failure. You learned how to monitor the performance of your server, and how to trace database activity and track the performance of queries running against the databases on your server. Finally, you saw how to configure read replication, to distribute read-heavy workloads and reduce read-latency across servers.

You then applied this knowledge and created replicas of an Azure Database for PostgreSQL to improve the performance of an existing application.

## Takeaways

In this module you learned how to:

- Protect your server, and recover after a failure.
- Monitor and tune your server.
- Trace and track activity for your database.
- Configure read replicas for your database.
