Azure provides you with tools to enable organizations to protect, monitor, and tune their Azure databases.

Imagine you work as a database developer for an on-line retail organization. Your company has been selling bicycles and bicycle parts directly to end-consumers and distributors for over a decade. Their systems store information in a database that you have previously migrated to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the Azure features available for protecting a database and server against malicious users and disasters. This module also describes how to monitor and tune a database running in Azure Database for MySQL or PostgreSQL.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Protect a database running in Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Monitor a database running in Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Trace and track activity for a database running in Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
