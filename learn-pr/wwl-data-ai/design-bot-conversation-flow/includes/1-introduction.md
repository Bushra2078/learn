While there are many ways you can implement a bot, some common features of bots include:

- Users interact with a bot by initiating *activities* in *turns*.
- Activities are events, such as a user joining a conversation or sending a message.
- Messages can be text, speech, or visual interface elements (such as *cards* or *buttons*).
- A flow of activities can form a *dialog*, in which state is maintained to manage a multi-turn conversation.
- Activities are exchanged across *channels*, such as web chat, email, Microsoft Teams, and others.
