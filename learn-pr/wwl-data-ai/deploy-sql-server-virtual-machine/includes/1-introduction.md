The most common reason for deploying SQL Server in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is because you want an easy, straightforward method to migrate an existing on-premises SQL Server into the cloud. Understanding the options and methods for deploying SQL Server in an Azure VM is critical to ensure a successful migration. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) allows for greater flexibility in configuration. This flexibility means that you, as a database administrator, must plan your configuration carefully. Choosing the proper VM sizing, storage, and networking options is crucial to ensure adequate performance for your workloads.

This module will focus on ways to provision and deploy Microsoft SQL Server into an Azure virtual machine. It will also provide concrete information on the various options when you are performing a migration.
