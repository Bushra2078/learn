Use Transact-SQL to enhance your querying experience. In this module, you'll learn how to use Transact-SQL capabilities including views, derived tables, and Common Table Expressions, to help you to meet your daily querying needs. For example, you can use Transact-SQL to break down complex queries into smaller and more manageable parts, and even get the data need without having to directly access the underlying source data. 


By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Create and query tables using Transact-SQL. 
- Create and query views using Transact-SQL.
- Create queries using Common Table Expressions (CTE).
- Write queries that use derived tables.
