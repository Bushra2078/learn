You've learned that you can use Transact-SQL for advanced queries in your databases. For example, you've learned that you can use derived tables, temporary tables, and views to break down complex queries into smaller and more manageable parts and implement an extra layer of security for your underlying source tables.

In this module, you've learned how to:

- Create and query tables using Transact-SQL.
- Create and query views using Transact-SQL.
- Create queries using Common Table Expressions (CTE).
- Write queries that use derived tables.
