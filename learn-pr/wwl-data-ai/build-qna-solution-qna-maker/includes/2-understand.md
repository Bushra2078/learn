The **QnA Maker** service enables you to define a *knowledge base* of question and answer pairs that can be queried using natural language input. The knowledge base can be published to a REST endpoint and consumed by client applications, commonly *bots*.

There are two versions of the QnA Maker service. To use the _managed QnA Maker_ service, create a **Text Analytics** resource with the *custom question answering* feature enabled in your Azure subscription. To use the _non-managed QnA Maker_ service, create a **QnA Maker** resource. You can use either resource in the QnA Maker Portal to edit and publish a knowledge base.
