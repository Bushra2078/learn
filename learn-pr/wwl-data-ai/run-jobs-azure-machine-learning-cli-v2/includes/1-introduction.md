The Azure Machine Learning CLI (v2) is an Azure CLI extension you can use to train models on Azure compute.

You're a machine learning engineer at a company selling bikes. The data science team has been training machine learning models on their own computers. The locally trained models could be very valuable, but are hard to share across the organization.

The data science team wants to use Azure Machine Learning for all future projects to more easily collaborate and share work.

You set up an Azure Machine Learning workspace for the data science team. To show them how the workspace works, you take a customer churn model that is trained by one of the data scientists. You get a training script and a dataset from this data scientist and you plan to train the model in the cloud with Azure Machine Learning.

To train a model with Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can use the Designer in the Azure Machine Learning Studio, the Python SDK, or the Azure CLI. To automate the training and retraining of models more effectively, the CLI is the preferred approach.

This module shows you how to train a model and perform hyperparameter tuning with the Azure CLI (v2) for Azure Machine Learning.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Train a model with a Python script using the CLI (v2).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with the CLI (v2).
