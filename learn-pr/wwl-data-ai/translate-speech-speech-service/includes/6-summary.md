Speech translation from the Speech service enables real-time, multi-language speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation of audio streams. With the Speech SDK, your applications, tools, and devices have access to source transcriptions and translation outputs for provided audio. Interim transcription and translation results are returned as speech is detected, and finals results can be converted into synthesized speech.

Microsoft's translation engine is powered by two different approaches: statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (NMT). SMT uses advanced statistical analysis to estimate the best possible translations given the context of a few words. With NMT, neural networks are used to provide more accurate, natural-sounding translations by using the full context of sentences to translate words.
