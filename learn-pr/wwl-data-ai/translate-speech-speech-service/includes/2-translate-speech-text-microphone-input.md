In this exercise, you will learn how to accept audio input from a microphone and translate that audio to a different language. The translation output will be sent to the terminal window as text. The exercise will also use the Speech service to synthesize the translation to speech.  As a result of requiring audio capabilities of your computer, this exercise relies on code being executed locally.  The exercise will not use the Visual Studio Code Online environment as a result.

The speech translation capabilities require working with some key objects:

- A SpeechTranslationConfig object that will accept
    - your subscription key and region information
    - attributes for source and target language
    - a speech output voice name
- A TranslationRecognizer object that will accept
    - the SpeechTranslationConfig object listed above
    - calling the method to start the recognition process
- A TranslationRecognitionResult object is returned for you to evaluate for the result

## Set up a Speech Service

For you to be successful in completing the exercises for this module, you must have the proper resources in place on Azure. The following steps outline creating an Azure subscription, or using a trial key.  Creating the Speech Service resources on Azure is required for the exercises to work successfully for synthesizing text to speech.  Complete this section before moving on to the remaining exercises.

### Create an Azure Speech Resource

You will require an Azure subscription in order to complete this exercise.  With the Azure subscription, you can create the necessary Speech Service resource. If you do not have an Azure subscription, [create one here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

Microsoft also provides the ability to try some of the Cognitive Services without an Azure subscription.  You can choose to use the free trial by getting an API key on the [Try Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/) page. If you choose the free option, you can skip the following section on creating an Azure resource.  You will use the API key in the later parts of the exercises.

#### Using an Azure Subscription

>[!NOTE]
>If you have already created a Speech Service resource that is still active, you can skip this section and move to the code section of your choice.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

1. Select **+ Create a resource**. In the **Search the Marketplace** box, type **speech** and press Enter.

1. In the **Results** list, select **Speech**. In the **Speech** pane, select **Create**.
1. Enter a unique name for your Speech Service resource.
1. Select an appropriate subscription.
1. Choose a location to host the resource.  This is typically the region where the resource will be used.
1. For **Pricing tier**, select a tier.  The tiers may change but currently, you can select F0 or S0.  For testing, we selected F0.
1. Create a new resource group (RG) named **mslearn-speechapi** to hold your resources.  You can also choose an existing RG if you wish
1. Select **Create** to create a subscription to the Speech Translation API.

After a short delay, your new Speech Translation API subscription will be available, and new API keys will be generated for programmatic use.  

> [!TIP]
> If you miss the notification that your resource is published, select the notification icon in the top bar of the portal, and then select **Go to resource**, as shown in the following figure:

   ![Selecting "Go to resource" from the notification icon](../media/3-subscribe-speech-translation-go-resource.png)

#### View the subscription keys and endpoint

To access your Speech Service from an application, you will need to get two pieces of information from the Azure portal:

- A *subscription key* that's passed with every request to authenticate the call.
- The *endpoint* that exposes your service on the network.

You will need the subscription key when using the Speech SDK or the REST APIs but the endpoint will only be required for the REST API access.   Using the Speech SDK in an application uses the key, but also requires a region.  You will see the use of the key and region information in the exercise later in the module.

1. In the left menu of the portal, select **Resource groups**, and then select the **mslearn-speechapi** resource group that you created for the Speech Translation API.
1. Select the Speech Translation subscription name (such as **SpeechTranslation**).
1. There are two locations that will display your endpoint and at least one key. 
1. Under the **RESOURCE MANAGEMENT** group, select the **Quick start** option to display **Key1** and **Endpoint** values.
1. The second option is used to view a second key for the service. Under the **RESOURCE MANAGEMENT** group, select **Keys and Endpoint** to view the Service name, the endpoint, and two API keys.
1. Copy the value of **KEY 1** or **KEY 2** to the clipboard for use in an application.

## Environment Setup

This exercise will make use of C# for the programming language.  To ensure cross-platform capability, the application code will use [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core). If you do not have .NET Core installed on your computer, download and install from the link.

You will also require [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Download and install before starting the exercises.

## Create the Project

1. Ensure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) installed before moving forward.
1. Create a new folder for this project. Name the folder **Translate_Speech**.
1. Open Visual Studio Code and then open the **Translate_Speech** folder.
1. In the folder pane of Visual Studio Code, select the **Translate_Speech** folder and select the **Terminal** menu and then **New Terminal**.
1. When the terminal opens, enter the following command ```dotnet new console```
1. Visual Studio Code will create the project structure for a new .NET Core console-based application.
1. Select the Program.cs file to open it in an editor view.
1. If you receive a message indicating **Required assets to build and debug are missing....**, select Yes to install them.
1. Copy the following code and paste at the top of Program.cs to ensure the necessary using statements bring in the libraries required.

    ```csharp
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Translation;
    ```

1. We will be calling the service asynchronously so we require the Threading.Tasks library.
1. The other two libraries are required for the speech and translation libraries.
1. Replace the Program class with the following code.  Leave the namespace portion intact.

    ```csharp
    class Program
    {
        public static async Task TranslateSpeechToText()
        {
            // Creates an instance of a speech translation config with specified subscription key and service region.
            // Replace with your own subscription key and region identifier from here: https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion
            var config = SpeechTranslationConfig.FromSubscription("YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion");

            // Sets source and target languages.
            // Replace with the languages of your choice, from list found here: https://aka.ms/speech/sttt-languages
            string fromLanguage = "en-US";
            string toLanguage = "de";
            config.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = fromLanguage;
            config.AddTargetLanguage(toLanguage);

            // Creates a translation recognizer using the default microphone audio input device.
            using (var recognizer = new TranslationRecognizer(config))
            {
                // Starts translation, and returns after a single utterance is recognized. The end of a
                // single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15
                // seconds of audio is processed. The task returns the recognized text as well as the translation.
                // Note: Since RecognizeOnceAsync() returns only a single utterance, it is suitable only for single
                // shot recognition like command or query.
                // For long-running multi-utterance recognition, use StartContinuousRecognitionAsync() instead.
                Console.WriteLine("Say something...");
                var result = await recognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();

                // Checks result.
                if (result.Reason == ResultReason.TranslatedSpeech)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED '{fromLanguage}': {result.Text}");
                    Console.WriteLine($"TRANSLATED into '{toLanguage}': {result.Translations[toLanguage]}");
                }
                else if (result.Reason == ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED '{fromLanguage}': {result.Text} (text could not be translated)");
                }
                else if (result.Reason == ResultReason.NoMatch)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
                }
                else if (result.Reason == ResultReason.Canceled)
                {
                    var cancellation = CancellationDetails.FromResult(result);
                    Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={cancellation.Reason}");

                    if (cancellation.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={cancellation.ErrorCode}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails={cancellation.ErrorDetails}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you update the subscription info?");
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            TranslateSpeechToText().Wait();
        }
    }

    ```    

1. You may notice that there are some code issues with squiggly lines.  This is because we need to add the appropriate package to the project.  Type the following command to add the Speech package, ```dotnet add package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech```
1. Once you import the package, ensure that your computer has a default microphone input configured and working.
1. Paste your Speech service key and region into the **YourSubscriptionKey** and **YourServiceRegion** placeholders in the code.
1. In the Terminal, type the command ```dotnet run``` to run the code.
1. At the prompt **Say something...**, speak an English phrase and then pause.
1. When the program detects a pause in the speech, it will send the audio to the service for translation.
1. You should see the response output in the Terminal window, indicating the recognized text from your audio and the showing the conversion into the target language.
1. Explore other language options by changing the **from** and **to** language attributes.

1. Copy and paste this Python code into your **translate_speech.py** file.

    ```python
    import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk
    
    speech_key, service_region = "YourSubscriptionKey", "YourServiceRegion"
    
    def translate_speech_to_text():

        # Creates an instance of a speech translation config with specified subscription key and service region.
        # Replace with your own subscription key and region identifier from here: https://aka.ms/speech/sdkregion
        translation_config = speechsdk.translation.SpeechTranslationConfig(subscription=speech_key, region=service_region)

        # Sets source and target languages.
        # Replace with the languages of your choice, from list found here: https://aka.ms/speech/sttt-languages
        fromLanguage = 'en-US'
        toLanguage = 'de'
        translation_config.speech_recognition_language = fromLanguage
        translation_config.add_target_language(toLanguage)

        # Creates a translation recognizer using and audio file as input.
        recognizer = speechsdk.translation.TranslationRecognizer(translation_config=translation_config)

        # Starts translation, and returns after a single utterance is recognized. The end of a
        # single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15
        # seconds of audio is processed. It returns the recognized text as well as the translation.
        # Note: Since recognize_once() returns only a single utterance, it is suitable only for single
        # shot recognition like command or query.
        # For long-running multi-utterance recognition, use start_continuous_recognition() instead.
        print("Say something...")
        result = recognizer.recognize_once()

        # Check the result
        if result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.TranslatedSpeech:
            print("RECOGNIZED '{}': {}".format(fromLanguage, result.text))
            print("TRANSLATED into {}: {}".format(toLanguage, result.translations['de']))
        elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
            print("RECOGNIZED: {} (text could not be translated)".format(result.text))
        elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.NoMatch:
            print("NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized: {}".format(result.no_match_details))
        elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.Canceled:
            print("CANCELED: Reason={}".format(result.cancellation_details.reason))
            if result.cancellation_details.reason == speechsdk.CancellationReason.Error:
                print("CANCELED: ErrorDetails={}".format(result.cancellation_details.error_details))

    translate_speech_to_text()
    ```

1. Ensure that your computer has a default microphone input configured and working.
1. Paste your Speech service key and region into the **YourSubscriptionKey** and **YourServiceRegion** placeholders in the code.
1. If you using Visual Studio Code, right-click anywhere in the Python code file and choose **Run Python File in Terminal**, or click the green arrow in the upper right corner of the editor window to run the Python file.
1. At the prompt **Say something...**, speak an English phrase and then pause.
1. When the program detects a pause in the speech, it will send the audio to the service for translation.
1. You should see the response output in the Terminal window, indicating the recognized text from your audio and the showing the conversion into the target language.
1. Explore other language options by changing the **from** and **to** language attributes.
