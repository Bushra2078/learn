Translation of speech builds on speech recognition by recognizing and transcribing spoken input in a specified language, and returning translations of the transcription in one or more other languages.

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Provision Azure resources for speech translation.
- Generate text translation from speech.
- Synthesize spoken translations.

The units in the module include important conceptual information about the Speech service and how to use its API through one of the supported software development kits (SDKs), after which you'll be able to try the Speech service for yourself in a hands-on exercise. To complete the hands-on exercise, you will need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free?azure-portal=true).
