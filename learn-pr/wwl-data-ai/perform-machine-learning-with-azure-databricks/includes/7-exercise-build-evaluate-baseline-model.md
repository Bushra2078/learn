In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **07-Machine-Learning** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **6. Exercise ML Workflows** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

In this exercise, you will enact parts of the Machine Learning workflow, such as do train-test split on a dataset, and then build and evaluate a baseline model. Optionally, you can try to beat the baseline model by training a linear regression model.

> [!Note]
> You will find a corresponding notebook within the `Solutions` subfolder. This contains completed cells for the exercise. Refer to the notebook if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
