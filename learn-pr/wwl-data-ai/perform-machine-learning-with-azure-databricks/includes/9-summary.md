In this module, you learned the basics of Machine Learning and learned how to use PySpark's machine learning package to build key parts of the machine learning workflow that include exploratory data analysis, model training, and model evaluation.

Now that you have concluded this module, you should know:

* Define machine learning
* Differentiate supervised and unsupervised tasks
* Identify regression and classification tasks
* Train a model, interpret the results, and create predictions
* Identify the main objectives of exploratory analysis
* Calculate statistical moments to determine the center and spread of data
* Create plots of data including histograms and scatterplots
* Calculate correlations between variables
* Explore more advanced plots to visualize the relation between variables
* Define the data analytics development cycle
* Motivate and perform a split between training and test data
* Train a baseline model
* Evaluate a baseline model's performance and improve it

## Cleanup

If you plan to complete other Azure Databricks modules, don't delete your Azure Databricks instance yet. You can use the same environment for the other modules.

### Delete the Azure Databricks instance

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. In the left pane, select **Resource groups**, and then find the resource group that contains your Azure Databricks instance.
1. Select the resource group, and either right-click the row or use the **ellipsis** (**...**) button to open the context menu.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter the name of the resource group, and then select **Delete**.
