There's a wide variety of roles involved in managing, controlling, and using data. Some roles are business-oriented, some involve more engineering, some focus on research, and some are hybrid roles that combine different aspects of data management. In this unit, you'll explore the most common job roles in the world of data. Your organization may define roles differently, or give them different names, but the roles described in this unit encapsulate the most common division of labor and responsibilities.

## What are the roles in the world of data?

There are three key job roles that deal with data in most organizations:

- **Database Administrators** manage databases, assigning permissions to users, storing backup copies of data and restore data in case of any failures.
- **Data Engineers** are vital in working with data, applying data cleaning routines, identifying business rules, and turning data into useful information.
- **Data Analysts** explore and analyze data to create visualizations and charts to enable organizations to make informed decisions.

## Azure Database Administrator role

An Azure database administrator is responsible for the design, implementation, maintenance, and operational aspects of on-premises and cloud-based database solutions built on Azure data services and SQL Server.  They're responsible for the overall availability and consistent performance and optimizations of the database solutions. They work with stakeholders to implement policies, tools, and processes for backup and recovery plans to recover following a natural disaster or human-made error. 

The database administrator is also responsible for managing the security of the data in the database, granting privileges over the data, granting or denying access to users as appropriate.


## Data Engineer role

A data engineer collaborates with stakeholders to design and implement data-related assets that include data ingestion pipelines, cleansing and transformation activities, and data stores for analytical workloads. They use a wide range of data platform technologies, including relational and nonrelational databases, file stores, and data streams.

They're also responsible for ensuring that the privacy of data is maintained within the cloud and spanning from on-premises to the cloud data stores. They also own the management and monitoring of data stores and data pipelines to ensure that data loads perform as expected.


## Data Analyst role
