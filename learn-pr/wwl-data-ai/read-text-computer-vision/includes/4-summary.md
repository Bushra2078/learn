Optical character recognition (OCR) has been around for a long time. The ability to recognize and extract text from documents, was one of the earliest uses. The ability to do the same extraction from images, is where the OCR API and the Read API can help.

Both of the APIs provide the ability to extract text from images.  The text can be typewritten or handwritten and can be at different angles within the image.  The main factor in choosing which API use is determined by the amount of text that needs to be processed.  The Read API is the service that is optimized for large text scenarios.

You can find out more about reading text with the Computer Vision service in the [service documentation](/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-recognizing-text?azure-portal=true).

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
