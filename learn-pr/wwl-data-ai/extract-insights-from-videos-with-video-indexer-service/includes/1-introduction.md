Imagine you are a lead developer creating a social network for travelers to share about their favorite destinations. You are developing the media sharing feature where travelers will upload their videos. Your goal is to help travelers search and filter to find videos uploaded by others.

Proper indexing of media and extracting insights is a challenge. Azure Media Services can be used to build a custom solution for your startup. The Video Indexer can extract insights from posted videos to help build a stunning platform with easy to implement features.

Azure Video Indexer is a service to extract insights from media. It uses machine learning models that can be further customized and trained. The video insights include face identification, text recognition, object labels, scene segmentations, and more. Additional insights are extracted from audio, such as transcription and emotion detection. You can use these results to improve search, extract clips, create thumbnails, and more.

In this module you will:

- Subscribe to the Video Indexer API.
- Upload and index videos to generate insights.
- Examine the Video Indexer processing output.
- Find specific moments in video files using the search endpoint.
- Detect key aspects in the videos, such as scenes, shots, and keyframes.
- View and edit insights for your indexed videos.

Pre-requisites:
- Python or C# (with HTTP and JSON libraries)
- knowledge of C# or Python programming language
- Active Azure subscription
- Local environment to edit and run code (environment setup will be included as part of the exercises)
