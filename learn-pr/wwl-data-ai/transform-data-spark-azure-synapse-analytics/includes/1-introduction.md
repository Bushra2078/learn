Apache Spark provides a powerful platform for performing data cleansing and transformation tasks on large volumes of data. By using the Spark *dataframe* object, you can easily load data from files in a data lake and perform complex modifications. You can then save the transformed data back to the data lake for downstream processing or ingestion into a data warehouse.

Azure Synapse Analytics provides Apache Spark pools that you can use to run Spark workloads to transform data as part of a data ingestion and preparation workload. You can use natively supported notebooks to write and run code on a Spark pool to prepare data for analysis. You can then use other Azure Synapse Analytics capabilities such as SQL pools to work with the transformed data.
