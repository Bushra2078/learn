In this module, you've learned how to use Apache Spark to transform data in Azure Synapse Analytics. Using Spark for complex data transformations is a common technique because of the inherent scalability of the Spark platform. You can use code in notebooks to experiment with data transformations, and then include those notebooks in automated pipelines as part of a data integration solution.
