Modern data warehousing is a generic term that describes the infrastructure and processes used to support large-scale data analytics. Modern data warehousing solutions combine conventional data warehousing used to support business intelligence (BI), which typically involves copying data from transactional data stores into a relational database with a schema that's optimized for querying and building multidimensional models; with techniques used for so-called "big data" analytics, in which large volumes of data in multiple formats are batch loaded or captured in real-time streams, and stored in a *data lake* from which distributed processing engines like Apache Spark are used to process the data at scale.
