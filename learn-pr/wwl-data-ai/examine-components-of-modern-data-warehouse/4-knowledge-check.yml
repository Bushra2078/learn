  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When should you use Azure Synapse Analytics?"
    choices:
    - content: "To perform very complex queries and aggregations"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Synapse Analytics is suitable for performing compute-intensive tasks such as these."
    - content: "To create dashboards from tabular data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Use Azure Analysis Services to create dashboards."
    - content: "To enable large number of users to query analytics data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Synapse Analytics is designed to support compute-intensive operations rather than high levels of query concurrency."
  - content: "What is the purpose of data ingestion?"
    choices:
    - content: "To perform complex data transformations over data received from external sources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Data ingestion has to run quickly, and shouldn't perform work that requires time and computation power."
    - content: "To capture data flowing into a data warehouse system as quickly as possible"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Data ingestion can receive data from multiple sources, including streams, and must run quickly enough so that it doesn't lose any incoming data."
    - content: "To visualize the results of data analysis"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Data ingestion is concerned with receiving data, not processing or visualizing that data."
  - content: "What is the primary difference between a *data lake* and a *data warehouse*?"
    choices:
    - content: "A data lake contains *structured information*, but a data warehouse holds *raw business data*"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A data warehousing solution converts the raw data in a data lake into meaningful business information in a data warehouse."
    - content: "A data lake holds *raw data*, but a data warehouse holds *structured information*"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A data warehousing solution converts the raw data in a data lake into meaningful business information in a data warehouse."
    - content: "Data stored in a data lake is dynamic, but information stored in a data warehouse is static"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The information held in both repositories will change over time as new data is ingested and processed."
