AI-900: Module 2 Explore Fundamentals of Machine Learning 

As you are preparing to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module, students will learn about Machine Learning including visual tools and the different forms of Machine Learning. Students will also explore the Azure Machine Learning Service including its features and capabilities.  

This module consists of two lessons: 

- Lesson 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning 
- Lesson 2 – Azure Machine Learning

Module 2 Tips and Tricks 

- Brush up on some basic mathematics and brief intro to regression, classification, and clustering 
- Assure students this is not a mathematics course 
- Allocate more time for this module to set up demos 
- Use analogies and examples where possible 

Module 2 Demo (optional) 

- Prepare ahead of time by completing the [Create Classification model](https://aka.ms/classificationmodule) exercise and use that to show students the training and inference pipelines, the endpoint for the published service, and the test interface in Azure ML Studio to generate a prediction. Spend no more than 10 minutes on this (so it's important to have pre-completed the exercise). 

Module 2 Lab (~45 mins) 

- Exercise 1: Explore Automated Machine Learning in Azure Machine Learning
