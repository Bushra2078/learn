As an educator, you play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. Skilling our future generations is critical work. With the increasing demand for cloud, AI, and machine learning skills, the AI-900 Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone. This course may be your students' first introduction to these concepts, and this course serves as a foundation for some of our more advanced courses.

It is recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center](https://aka.ms/ldc) (LDC) at least quarterly. If you haven't already done so, download the course materials from the LDC before continuing with this module.
