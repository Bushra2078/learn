Azure Cognitive Search is a powerful search service that can index a wide range of data from various sources. A core part of search is returning relevant results from search queries.

In this module, you'll explore how search calculates scores for documents and the tools you have to influence that score. You can boost individual terms in your search queries, add custom scoring profiles to focus on the most important field in your index, enrich your indexes with more languages, and return results based on their location.

This module builds on [Create a custom skill for Azure Cognitive Search](/learn/modules/create-enrichment-pipeline-azure-cognitive-search) to explore more advanced search features supported by Azure Cognitive Search.
