In this module, you've boosted search terms in a query to return more relevant results. You then saw how you can achieve the same results by adding a default scoring profile.

You then explored the lexical analysis phase of search processing and how index analyzers can create better searches with improved tokens.

Finally, you improved your search index by adding languages and using geographical locations to order results by distance.

To learn more about each of these topics, see the documentation:
