The best way to learn about object detection with the Custom Vision service is to explore it for yourself.

In this exercise, you'll use a *Visual Studio Online* environment:

1. Follow the instructions at [https://aka.ms/learn-ai-fundamentals](https://aka.ms/learn-ai-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to set up your environment - this should take a few minutes.
2. When your environment is ready, open the **Object Detection.ipynb** notebook file. This notebook contains notes, instructions, and code that you can run to see the Custom Vision service in action.
3. When you're finished, you can delete the Visual Studio Online environment - or keep it if you want to explore further.
