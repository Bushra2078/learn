Azure supports a number of database services, enabling you to run popular database management systems, such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, in the cloud.

Azure database services are fully managed, freeing up valuable time youâ€™d otherwise spend managing your database. Enterprise-grade performance with built-in high availability means you can scale quickly and reach global distribution without worrying about costly downtime. Developers can take advantage of industry-leading innovations such as built-in security with automatic monitoring and threat detection, automatic tuning for improved performance. On top of all of these features, you have guaranteed availability.

Suppose you're a data engineer at Contoso, and are responsible for creating and managing databases. You've been asked to set up three new relational data stores: Azure SQL database, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.

In this module, you'll explore the options available for creating and configuring Azure relational data services.
