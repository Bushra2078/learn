To complete this exercise, you'll need the following:

- **A Microsoft Azure subscription**. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true).
- **A Python environment** in which you can run the Jupyter notebooks in the [MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai900](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai900) GitHub repository. Launch a virtual lab environment from the gray box above which will provide you with a Python environment in Visual Studio Code. 
    - Alternatively, you can clone the lab files from GitHub into your own environment and follow these [instructions](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai900/blob/main/instructions/00%20-%20Local%20development.md) to set up your environment.  

## Using the virtual lab environment

1. Click on the button **"Sign in to launch VM mode"** above. 

2. Follow the directions on the right-hand pane. You will be guided through sign-in to Visual Studio Code, and directed to the lab for this module. 

3. When you are done with the entire lab, end it by clicking on **End >** at the bottom right hand corner. When you end the lab, you _do not_ keep changes made to files. You _do_ keep the resources created with your Azure subscription unless you follow the clean-up steps below.
