[Data science](/fabric/data-science/data-science-overview) is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and tools to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. 

In a typical data science project, it's a common practice to start with the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) where it involves understanding the patterns, spotting anomalies, testing hypotheses, and checking assumptions related to the underlying data.

The insights gained from EDA can guide data scientists in choosing the appropriate statistical or machine learning models that best fit the data. 

Microsoft Fabric allows you to seamlessly integrate your exploration results into a data science workflow. This can then be used to feed an upstream reporting solution, such as a Power BI report.
