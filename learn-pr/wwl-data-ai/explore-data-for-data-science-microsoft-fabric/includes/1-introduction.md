Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and tools to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. 

In a typical data science project, it's a common practice to start with the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) where it involves understanding the patterns, spotting anomalies, testing hypotheses, and checking assumptions related to the underlying data.

The insights gained from EDA can guide data scientists in choosing the appropriate statistical or machine learning models that best fit the data. 

- **Data cleaning:** Data scientists can identify errors and anomalies in the data. These could be missing values, inconsistent data entries, or outliers that could skew analysis results.

- **Feature engineering:** When important variables and relationships can be used to create new features for machine learning models.

- **Assumption checking:** Many statistical and machine learning models make certain assumptions about the data (e.g., normality, linearity). EDA allows these assumptions to be checked visually and analytically.

EDA is a vital step that helps data scientists understand their data better, make informed decisions throughout the analysis, and achieve more accurate results.

### Use case scenario

Throughout this module, we're using an example scenario to explain key data migration concepts.

You’ve been hired as a data scientist at a global healthcare company and you’re working with consultants to initiate a data analysis project that meets the organization’s business requirements.

The goal of the project is to improve patient outcomes by identifying patterns and trends in the data. This could include predicting disease risk, optimizing treatment plans, or improving hospital efficiency.

The project should also provide actionable insights that can inform business decisions. For example, the analysis might identify areas where the company can reduce costs or improve service.

Regardless of whether you're a seasoned professional or just beginning your journey in the field, by the end of this module, you will have gained a solid understanding of how to utilize Microsoft Fabric for your data exploration needs through notebooks.
