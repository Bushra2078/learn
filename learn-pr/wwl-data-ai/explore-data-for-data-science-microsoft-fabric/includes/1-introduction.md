[Data science](/fabric/data-science/data-science-overview) is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and tools to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. 

In a typical data science project, it's a common practice to start with the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) where it involves understanding the patterns, spotting anomalies, testing hypotheses, and checking assumptions related to the underlying data.

The insights gained from EDA can guide data scientists in choosing the appropriate statistical or machine learning models that best fit the data. 

Microsoft Fabric allows you to seamlessly integrate your exploration results into a data science workflow. This can then be used to feed an upstream reporting solution, such as a Power BI report.

### Use case scenario

Throughout this module, we're using an example scenario to explain key data exploration concepts.

You’ve been hired as a data scientist at a global healthcare company and you’re working with consultants to initiate a data analysis project.

The goal of the project is to improve patient outcomes by identifying patterns and trends in the data. This could include predicting disease risk, optimizing treatment plans, or improving hospital efficiency.

The project should also provide actionable insights that can inform business decisions. For example, the analysis might identify areas where the company can reduce costs or improve service.

Regardless of whether you're a seasoned professional or just beginning your journey in the field, by the end of this module, you'll have gained a solid understanding of how to use Microsoft Fabric for your data exploration needs.
