Loading and exploring data are the first steps in any data science project. They involve understanding the dataâ€™s structure, content, and source, which are crucial for subsequent analysis.

Explore the data by reading it from a Lakehouse into a notebook. Clean and transform the data based on the model's requirements.

a.	Importing and loading data (locally and remote sources)

b.	Supported data sources and formats

c.	Loading data into a notebook using Microsoft Fabric connectors
