The ability to automate translation between languages helps remove barriers to collaboration across cultural and geographical boundaries.

The Translator Text and Speech cognitive services in Azure provide cloud-based intelligence to support text and speech translation, enabling a wide range of scenarios for real-time and batch-process translation.

You can find out more about the using these services for translation in the [Translator text service documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/) and the [Speech service documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/).
