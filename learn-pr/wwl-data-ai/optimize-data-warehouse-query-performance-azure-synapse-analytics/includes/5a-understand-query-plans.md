## How to obtain a query plan in Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL Pool ##

Often Database Engineers and Database Administrators have a need to analyse and investigate query execution in SQL Pools. This analysis is done by using dynamic management views (DMVs).
> [!Note] 
> Permissions to query the DMVs require either **VIEW DATABASE STATE** or **CONTROL** permission, in typical scenarios, granting **VIEW DATABASE STATE** is the preferred method as it is more restrictive
> ``` SQL
> GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE to TestUser; 
> ```

> [!Warning]
> An attacker can use **sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests** to retrieve information about specific database objects by simply having VIEW SERVER STATE permission and by not having database-specific permission.

Azure Snyapse queries. which are executed are logged, ** sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests ** contains the last 10,000 queries executed. 
you can use the following query to determine the top 10 longest running queries 
```SQL
SELECT TOP 10 request_id, status, total_elapsed_time
FROM sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests
WHERE status not in ('completed', 'Failed','Cancelled')
ORDER BY total_elapsed_time DESC
```
When looking at the results, those in a **suspended** state can be queued due to a lack of resources from a large number of active running queries. These queries will also appear in the **sys.dm_pdw_waits** in which your focus would be more on waits including **UserConcurrencyResourceType**. There are other reasons that queries may be in a wait queue such as object locks. More information on this topic can be found by [investating queries waiting for resources.](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-manage-monitor#monitor-waiting-queries)

>```SQL
> -- you can use an asterisk to show all attributes returned from the DMV
> -- but request_id is what will be used in the next step.

> WHERE [label] = 'MyQuery';
> ```
### How to read the query plan ###

Once the request_id has been obtained, use it with the **sys.dm_pdw_request_steps** to retrieve the distributed SQL (DSQL) plan as shown below:

```SQL
-- be sure to replace QID#### with the request_id you retrieved above

SELECT * FROM sys.dm_pdw_request_steps
WHERE request_id = 'QID####'
ORDER BY step_index;
```
> [!Note]
> If the DSQL plan is taking a lengthy amount of time to return, it could be caused by a complex plan requiring many DSQL steps or just a long running step. If there are several **move** operations within the plan with a lot of steps, then consider optimizing the impacted [table distribution(s)](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-tables-distribute) to reduce data movement.

When looking at the returned DSQL plan, further information about individual steps by looking at the *operation_type* of any long-running step. Take note of the **Step Index** which we'll use to investigate two types of perfomrnace impacting operations including 


1 **SQL Operations** which include:
- OnOperation
- Remote Operation
- Return Operation

2 **Data Movement Operations** including:
- ShuffleMoveOperation
- BroadcastMoveOperation
- TrimMoveOperation
- PartitionMoveOperation
- MoveOperation
- CopyOperation

From the prior step using **sys.dm_pdw_request_steps**, we want to  use the *request_id* and *step_index* to retrieve exection informatin of the query step on **all** of the distributed databasee using a query simsilar to the one below.
```SQL
--Find the distribution run times for a particular SQL Step
--retrieve request_id and step_index with the values from the steps above.

SELECT * FROM sys.dm_pdw_sql_requests
WHERE request_id = 'QID####' AND step_index = 4;
```

When, the query step is still *running* the **DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN** can be utilized to retrieve the SQL Server estrimatedplan from the plan cache for the step running on a specific distribution as shown below.
```SQL
 --Retrieve the SQL Server execution plan for a running query on a particular SQL pool or control node
 --Replace distribution_id and spid from the results from the previous query
 --DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN( distribution_id, spid)

 DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN(7, 31)
```
## Looking for movement on the distributed databases ##

Using the *Request ID* and the *Step Index* as previously retrieved above with **sys.dm_pdw_dms_workers** will allow the retrieval of information about any data movement steps running on each distribution as shown below.
```SQL
 --Find all workers that are completing a Data Movement Step and their details
 --Replace request_id and step_index with the values from the prior steps shown above.

SELECT * FROM sys.dm_pdw_dms_workers
WHERE request_id = 'QID####' AND step_index = 2;

```
> [!Note]
> checking the *total_elapsed_time* will help determine if a particular distribution is taking significantly longer than others for data movement.
> for any long-running distribution, check the *rows_processed* column to derminie if it is materially larger than others. if so, this might indicate skew of your underlying data.

One example of a bad operation that can cause performance problems such as data skew is distributing on a column that contains a lot of NULL values, which will cause those rose to land in the same distribution. If possible, eliminate nulls or filter them out of your query althogether to increase performance.
