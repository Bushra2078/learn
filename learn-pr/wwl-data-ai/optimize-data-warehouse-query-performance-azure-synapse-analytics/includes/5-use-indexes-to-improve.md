When a table is created, by default the data structure has no indexes and is called a heap. A well-designed indexing strategy can reduce disk I/O operations and consume less system resources therefore improving query performance, especially when using filtering, scans, and joins in a query.

Dedicated SQL Pools have the following indexing options available:

## Clustered Columnstore Index

Dedicated SQL Pools create a clustered columnstore index when no index options are specified on a table. Clustered columnstore indexes offer both the highest level of data compression as well as the best overall query performance. Clustered columnstore indexes will generally outperform clustered rowstore indexes or heap tables and are usually the best choice for large tables.

Additional compression on the data can be gained also with the index option COLUMNSTORE_ARCHIVE. These reduced sizes allow less memory to be used when accessing and using the data as well as reducing the IOPs required to retrieve data from storage.

Columnstore works on segments of 1,024,000 rows that get compressed and optimized by column. This segmentation further helps to filter out and reduce the data accessed through leveraging metadata stored which summarizes the range and values within each segment during query optimization.

## Clustered Index

Clustered Rowstore Indexes define how the table itself is stored, ordered by the columns used for the Index. There can be only one clustered index on a table.

Clustered indexes are best for queries and joins that require ranges of data to be scanned, preferably in the same order that the index is defined.

## Non-Clustered Index

A non-clustered index can be defined on a table or view with a clustered index or on a heap. Each index row in the non-clustered index contains the non-clustered key value and a row locator. This is a data structure separate/additional to the table or heap. You can create multiple non-clustered indexes on a table.

Non clustered indexes are best used when used for the columns in a join, group by statement or where clauses that return an exact match or few rows.
