  questions:
  - content: "Your team has written a SQL query for Azure Cosmos DB SQL API with the following text: ``SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.sku = 'RD3387G'``. Which lookup method will the query engine use for the **sku** filter?"
    choices:
    - content: "``Full scan``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The query uses an equality filter that can be evaluated using the inverted tree."
    - content: "``Index scan``."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The query uses an equality filter that can be evaluated directly with a seek instead of a scan within the inverted tree."
    - content: "``Index seek``."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The equality filter allows the query engine to perform a seek of a specific value."
  - content: "Which property of an indexing policy should you set to disable all indexing for a container?"
    choices:
    - content: "``indexingMode``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Setting the ``indexingMode`` property to ``none`` disables all indexing."
    - content: "``excludedPaths``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``excludedPaths`` property determines which paths are excluded from the index, not whether the indexer will run."
    - content: "``automatic``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Disabling ``automatic`` indexing using a boolean value of ``false`` doesn't disable all indexing for the container."
