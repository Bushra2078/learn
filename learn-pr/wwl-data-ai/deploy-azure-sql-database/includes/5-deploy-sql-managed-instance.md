While many organizations initially migrate to Azure using IaaS offerings, the platform as a service (PaaS) service offering allows for additional benefits. One key benefit is that you no longer have to install or patch SQL Server as that is performed by the service. Additionally, consistency checking, and backups are also part of the managed service, and there are additional security and performance tools that are included in the PaaS offerings.

Azure SQL Managed Instance is a fully functional SQL Server instance that is almost 100% compatible with your on-premises ecosystem including features like SQL Agent, access to tempdb, cross-database query and common language runtime (CLR). The service uses the same infrastructure as Azure SQL Database and includes all the benefits of the PaaS service such as automatic backups, automatic patching, and built-in high availability, just to name a few.

### Azure SQL Managed Instance Features

Azure SQL Managed Instance allows for easy migration paths for existing applications by allowing restores from on-premises backups. Unlike Azure SQL Database, which is designed around single database structures, Managed Instance provides an entire SQL Server instance, allowing up to 100 databases, as well as providing access to the system databases. Managed Instance provides other features that are not available in Azure SQL Database, including cross-database queries, common language runtime (CLR) and along with the msdb system database, it allows the use of SQL Agent.

### Options

There are two service tiers available when creating an Azure SQL Managed Instance, and they are the same as Azure SQL Database vCore model (managed instance is purchased using the vCore model), Business Critical and General Purpose. There are minimal functionality differences between the two tiers—the main two are that Business Critical includes In-Memory OLTP and offers a readable secondary, neither of which is available with the General Purpose tier. Both tiers offer the same levels of availability and allow for independent configuration of storage and compute.

### High Availability

Because Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is backed by the PaaS Service, it has high availability baked into the product. A standalone Managed Instance offers a 99.99% Service Level Agreement (SLA) which guarantees at most 52.60 minutes of downtime per year. The architecture is the same as Azure SQL Database with General Purpose, which uses storage replication for availability, and Business critical using multiple replicas.

### Backups

Automatic backups are also automatically configured for Managed Instance. One key difference between Managed Instance and Azure SQL Database is that with MI you can manually make a copy-only backup of a database. You must back up to a URL, as access to the local storage is not permissible. You can also configure long-term retention (LTR) for retaining automatic backups for up to 10 years in geo-redundant Azure blob storage.

Database backups occur on the same schedule as with Azure SQL Database. These schedules are not adjustable.

- Full – Once a week

- Differential – Every 12 hours

- Transaction Log – Every 5-10 minutes depending on transaction log usage

Restoring a database to a Managed Instance is also similar to the process with Azure SQL Database. You can use:

- Azure portal

- PowerShell

- Azure CLI

However, there are some limitations when restoring. In order to restore from one instance to another, both instances must reside within the same Azure subscription as well as the same Azure region. You also cannot restore the entire managed instance, only individual databases within the Managed Instance itself.

As with Azure SQL Database, you cannot restore over an existing database. Drop or rename the existing database prior to restoring it from backup. Since Managed Instance is a fully functional SQL Server instance, you can execute a RESTORE command whereas with Azure SQL Database that is not possible. However, since it is a PaaS service, there are limitations.

- You must restore from a URL endpoint. You do not have access to local drives.

- You can use the following options (in addition to specifying the database):

	- FILELISTONLY

	- HEADERONLY

	- LABELONLY

	- VERIFYONLY

- Backup files containing multiple log files cannot be restored

- Backup files containing multiple backup sets cannot be restored

- Backups containing In-Memory/FILESTREAM cannot be restored

By default, the databases in a managed instance are encrypted using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with a Microsoft managed key. In order to take a user-initiated copy only backup, you must turn off TDE for the specific database. If a database is encrypted, you can restore it, however, you will need to ensure that you have access to either the certificate or asymmetric key that was used to encrypt the database. If you do not have either of those two items, you will not be able to restore the database to a Managed Instance.

### Disaster Recovery

Azure SQL Database Managed Instance offers auto-failover groups as a means to implement disaster recovery. This feature protects the entire managed instance and all of the databases contained within it, not just specific databases. This process asynchronously replicates data from the Azure SQL Managed Instance to a secondary; however, it is currently limited to the paired Azure region of the primary copy, and only one replica is allowed.

Much like Azure SQL Database, auto-failover groups offer read-write and read-only listener endpoints, which facilitate easy connection string management. In the event of a failover, application connection strings will automatically be routed to the appropriate instance. While fairly consistent with Azure SQL Database, these endpoints follow a slightly different format, `<fog-name>.zone_id.database.windows.net whereas Azure SQL Database is in the <fog-name>.secondary.database.windows.net` format.

Each managed instance, primary and secondary, must be within the same DNS zone. This placement will ensure that the same multi-domain certificate can be used for client connection authentication between either of the two instances in the same failover group. You can specify a “DNS Zone Partner” through various methods such as the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI.
