When doing performance tuning in Azure SQL, understanding the importance of statistics is critical. Statistics are stored in the user database as binary large objects (blobs) that contain statistical information about the distribution of data values in one or more columns of a table or indexed view. The query optimizer uses column and index statistics to understand the distribution of data in order to determine cardinality. Cardinality estimates are then used by the query optimizer to generate the execution plan. Furthermore, cardinality estimates help to determine what type of operation (e.g. Index seek or scan) is employed in order to retrieve the data requested.
