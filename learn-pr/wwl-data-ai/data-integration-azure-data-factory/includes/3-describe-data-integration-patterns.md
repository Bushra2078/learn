Microsoft Azure provides a variety of data platform services that enables you to perform different types of analytics. Whether it is a descriptive analytics solution in a data warehouse, through to predictive analytics within HDInsight, Azure Databricks or Machine Learning Services. There is a need for a service to  deal with the important aspect of data integration.

Data integration firstly involves the collection of data from one or more sources. Optionally, it typically then includes a process where the data may be cleansed and transformed, or perhaps augmented with additional data and prepared. Finally, the amalgamated data is stored in a data platform service that handles the type of analytics that you want to perform. This process can be automated by Azure Data Factory in a pattern known as Extract, Transform and Load (ETL).


### Extract

During the extraction process, data engineers define the data and its source:

* **Define the data source**: Identify source details such as the resource group, subscription, and identity information such as a key or secret.

* **Define the data**: Identify the data to be extracted. Define data by using a database query, a set of files, or an Azure Blob storage name for blob storage.

### Transform

* **Define the data transformation**: Data transformation operations can include splitting, combining, deriving, adding, removing, or pivoting columns. Map fields between the data source and the data destination. You might also need to aggregate or merge data. 

### Load

* **Define the destination**: During a load, many Azure destinations can accept data formatted as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), file, or blob. You might need to write code to interact with application APIs. 

    Azure Data Factory offers built-in support for Azure Functions. You'll also find support for many programming languages, including Node.js, .NET, Python, and Java. Although Extensible Markup Language (XML) was common in the past, most systems have migrated to JSON because of its flexibility as a semistructured data type.

* **Start the job**: Test the ETL job in a development or test environment. Then migrate the job to a production environment to load the production system.

* **Monitor the job**: ETL operations can involve many complex processes. Set up a proactive and reactive monitoring system to provide information when things go wrong. Set up logging according to the technology that will use it.

## ETL tools

As a data engineer, there are several available tools for ETL. Azure Data Factory provides nearly 100 enterprise connectors and robust resources for both code-free and code-based users to accomplish their data movement and transformation needs.

## Evolution from ETL

Azure has opened the way for technologies that can handle unstructured data at an unlimited scale. This change has shifted the paradigm for loading and transforming data from ETL to extract, load, and transform (ELT). 

The benefit of ELT is that you can store data in its original format, be it JSON, XML, PDF, or images. In ELT, you define the data's structure during the transformation phase, so you can use the source data in multiple downstream systems.

In an ELT process, data is extracted and loaded in its native format. This change reduces the time required to load the data into a destination system. The change also limits resource contention on the data sources. 

The steps for the ELT process are the same as for the ETL process. They just follow a different order.

Another process like ELT is called extract, load, transform, and load (ELTL). The difference with ELTL is that it has a final load into a destination system.

There are two common types of data integration patterns that can be supported by Azure Data Factory.

### Modern Data Warehouse workloads: 

A Modern Data Warehouse is a centralized data store that provides descriptive analytics and decision support services across the whole enterprise using structured, unstructured, or streaming data sources. Data flows into the warehouse from multiple transactional systems, relational databases, and other data sources on a periodic basis. The stored data is used for historical and trend analysis reporting. The data warehouse acts as a central repository for many subject areas and contains the "single source of truth."

Azure Data factory is typically used to automate the process of extracting, transforming, and loading the data through a batch process against structured and unstructured data sources.

### Advanced Analytical Workloads

You can perform advanced analytics in the form of predictive or preemptive analytics using a range of Azure data platform services. Azure Data Factory provides the integration from source systems into a Data Lake store, and can initiate compute resources such as Azure Databricks, or HDInsight to use the data to perform the advanced analytical work
