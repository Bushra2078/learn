It's common in a search solution for users to want to refine query resuts by filtering and sorting based on field values. Azure Cognitive Search supports both of these capabilities through the search query API.

## Filtering results

You can apply filters to queries in two ways:

- By including filter criteria in a *simple* **search** expression.
- By providing an OData filter expression as a **$filter** parameter with a *full* syntax search expression.

You can apply a filter to any *filterable* field in the index. 

For example, suppose you want to find documents containing the text *London* that have an **author** field value of *Reviewer*.

You can achieve this result by submitting the following *simple* **search** expression:

```text
search=London+author='Reviewer'
queryType=Simple
```

Alternatively, you can use an OData filter in a **$filter** parameter with a *full* Lucene search expression like this:

```text
search=London
$filter=author eq 'Reviewer'
queryType=Full
```

> [!TIP]
> OData **$filter** expressions are case-sensitive!

### Filtering with facets

*Facets* are a useful way to present users with filtering criteria based on field values in a result set. They work best when a field has a small number of discrete values that can be displayed as links or options in the user interface.

To use facets, you must specify *facetable* fields for which you want to retrieve the possible values in an initial query. For example, you could use the following parameters to return all of the possible values for the **author** field:

```text
search=*
facet=author
```

The results from this query include a collection of discrete facet values that you can display in the user interface for the user to select. Then in a subsequent query, you can use the selected facet value to filter the results:

```text
search=*
$filter=author eq 'selected-facet-value-here'
```

## Sorting results

By default, results are sorted based on the relevancy score assigned by the query process, with the highest scoring matches listed first. However, you can override this sort order by including an OData **orderby** parameter that specifies one or more *sortable* fields and a sort order (*asc* or *desc*).

For example, to sort the results so that the most recently modified documents are listed first, you could use the following parameter values:

```text
search=*
$orderby=last_modified desc
```

## Filter and sort Margie's Travel results

You can apply filtering and sorting to the Margie's Travel search results by submitting a new query that includes a filter and sort order. Follow the steps for your preferred language.

:::zone pivot="csharp"

1. In the **C-Sharp/search-client/Pages** folder, open the **Index.cshtml.cs** code file containing the code for the web application's main page.
2. Examine the code in the **OnGet** function, noting that the parameters that can be submitted to the page include **sort** and **facet**. 
    - The **sort** parameter defines a sort order that is applied to the query results in the **OrderBy** search parameter. The default sort order is based on a built in field named **@search.score** which uses a *scoring profile* to calculate a relevance score for each result based on factors like the frequency of search term occurrence, the presence of search terms in the document name, and so on  (you can create custom scoring profiles as alternatives to the default one). You can specify the scoring profile sort order explicitly by using the built-in **search.score()** function, or you can specify an alternative sort order based on user selection. In this case, the user can choose to sort the results into ascending order by file name, descending order by size, or descending order by last modified date.
    - The **facet** parameter contains the value of the faceted **author** field that the user has selected from the original results. This is used to specify a filtering expression in the **Filter** search parameter. In this case, the filter is based on the **author** facet value selected by the user in the user interface, but you could specify any filtering expression that applies comparative logic to any filterable field.
3. In the **Terminal** pane, select the bash terminal for the **search-client** folder. If you have closed this terminal, right-click (Ctrl+click if using a Mac) the **search-client** folder and select **Open in Terminal**.
4. In the terminal for the **search-client** folder, enter the following command:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
5. Follow the link for the `https://localhost:5000/` address to open the web site in a new browser tab. Then in the Margie's Travel website, enter **San Francisco** into the search box and click **Search**.
6. When the results are displayed, select the **Reviewer** filter and the **Largest file size** sort option, and click **Refine Results**.
7. Observe that the results are filtered to include only reviews, and sorted into descending order of file size.
8. Close the browser tab containing the Margie's Travel web site and return to the Codespace tab. Then in the terminal for the **search-client** folder (where the dotnet process is running), enter Ctrl+C to stop the app.

:::zone pivot="python"

1. In the **Python/search-client** folder, open the **app&#46;py** code file containing the code for the Flask web application.
2. Examine the code in the **filter** function (for the **/filter** route), and review the **searchParams** definition. This includes some of the same parameters as the basic search function you examined previously, with the following differences:
    - **queryType**: This has been changed to **Full**, indicating that Lucene syntax for filtering expressions will be used.
    - **$filter**: This has been used to specify a filtering expression. In this case, the filter is based on the **author** facet value selected by the user in the user interface, but you could specify any filtering expression that applies comparative logic to any filterable field.
    - **$orderBy**: This parameter specifies a sort order for the results. The default sort order is based on a built in field named **@search.score** which uses a *scoring profile* to calculate a relevance score for each result based on factors like the frequency of search term occurrence, the presence of search terms in the document name, and so on  (you can create custom scoring profiles as alternatives to the default one). You can specify the scoring profile sort order explicitly by using the built-in **search.score()** function, or you can specify an alternative sort order based on user selection. In this case, the user can choose to sort the results into ascending order by file name, descending order by size, or descending order by last modified date.
3. In the **Terminal** pane, select the bash terminal for the **search-client** folder. If you have closed this terminal, right-click (Ctrl+click if using a Mac) the **search-client** folder and select **Open in Terminal**.
4. In the terminal for the **search-client** folder, enter the following command:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
5. Follow the link for the `https://127.0.0.1:5000/` address to open the web site in a new browser tab. Then in the Margie's Travel website, enter **San Francisco** into the search box and click **Search**.
6. When the results are displayed, select the **Reviewer** filter and the **Largest file size** sort option, and click **Refine Results**.
7. Observe that the results are filtered to include only reviews, and sorted into descending order of file size.
8. Close the browser tab containing the Margie's Travel web site and return to the Codespace tab. Then in the Python terminal for the **search-client** folder (where the flask application is running), enter Ctrl+C to stop the app.
