In this module, you learned how to use Azure Cognitive Search to create a basic search solution. At its simplest, an Azure Cognitive Search solution consists of:

- A *data source* where the data to be indexed is stored (though you can also push data directly into an index by using the API).
- An *index* that defines fields, which the user can query.
- An *indexer* that populates the fields in the index with values extracted from the source data.

You can use the Azure Cognitive Search REST APIs, or its Microsoft .NET SDK to create and manage index objects, and to implement a client application that queries the index to retrieve information.

For more information about Azure Cognitive Search, take a look at the [service documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/).
