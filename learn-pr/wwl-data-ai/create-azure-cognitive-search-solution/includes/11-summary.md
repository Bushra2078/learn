In this module, you learned how to use Azure Cognitive Search to create a cognitive search solution that consists of:

- A *data source* where the data to be indexed is stored (though you can also push data directly into an index by using the API).
- A *skillset* that defines and enrichment pipeline of cognitive skills to enrich the index data.
- An *index* that defines fields, which the user can query.
- An *indexer* that populates the fields in the index with values extracted from the source data.

Now that you've completed this module, you've learned to:

- Create an Azure Cognitive Search solution
- Develop a search application

You can use the Azure Cognitive Search REST APIs or SDKs to create and manage index objects, and to implement a client application that queries the index to retrieve information.

For more information about Azure Cognitive Search, take a look at the [service documentation](/azure/search/).
