quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Lucas has trained a model using Azure Databricks and now wants to serve it for real-time scoring. What should be the next action?"
    choices:
    - content: "Version the model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Versioning the model helps to perform comparisons between different historical versions of models."
    - content: "Transition the model to the archived stage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Transitioning a model to the archived stage is done when the model is no longer intended for use, usually because it has been supplanted by a superior model version."
    - content: "Register the model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Registering a model with Mlflow allows you to serve the model for real-time scoring. It makes using the trained model easy as the serving process builds a wrapper and exposes a REST API for scoring automatically."
  - content: "An MLflow run executes a Python script to train a model. The model is logged during the run but should also be registered. What should be included in the code to register the model during the run?"
    choices:
    - content: "`register_model`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This method is used when registering a model directly from an experiment."
    - content: "`registered_model_name`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. During a run, you can register a model by naming `registered_model_name`."
    - content: "`log_model`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This method is used to log artifacts but doesn't specify on itself that the model should be registered."
  - content: "Hanna has Read permissions and wants to transition a model from Staging to Production through the Azure Databricks UI. What can someone with Read permissions do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Perform the transition."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. She doesn't have enough permissions to perform the transition."
    - content: "Request the transition."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Any user with Read permissions or better may request a transition."
    - content: "She can only read the current stage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. With Read permissions or better you may still request a transition."
