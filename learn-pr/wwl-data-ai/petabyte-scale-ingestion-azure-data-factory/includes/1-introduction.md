Typically,the first stage of data integration work is to ingest source data from any number of systems into a destination, or an intermediary data store. Azure Data Factory provides differing ingestion methods that can connect to nearly a hundred different data connectors. The method you choose will largely depend on your current skillset, or preference for working with a technology to ingest data. 

Regardles of which method you choose, you must set up the appropriate infrastructure to support the data ingestion method through integration runtimes. In addition, you must also make sure that the data ingestion is secure in each data store, and whilst in transit

In this module, you will:

- Describe the data ingestion methods
- Understand the connectors that are available
- Use the Copy Activity
- Manage a self-hosted integration runtime
- Setup and Azure integration runtime
- Describe data ingestion security considerations
