> [!NOTE]
> A virtual machine containing the client tools you need is provided, along with the exercise instructions. Use the button above to launch the virtual machine. A limited number of concurrent sessions are available - if the hosted environment is unavailable, try again later. Alternatively, you can use these [setup instructions](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/dp-080-Transact-SQL/Instructions/Labs/00-setup.html) to create your own lab environment, and follow these [exercise instructions](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/dp-080-Transact-SQL/Instructions/Labs/11-create-stored-procedures.html).

When you finish the exercise, end the lab to close the VM. Don't forget to come back and complete the knowledge check to earn points for completing this module!
