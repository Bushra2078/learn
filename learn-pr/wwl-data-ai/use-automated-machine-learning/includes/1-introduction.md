*Machine Learning* is the foundation for most artificial intelligence solutions. Creating an intelligent solution often begins with the use of machine learning to train predictive models using historic data that you have collected.

*Azure Machine Learning* is a cloud service that you can use to train and manage machine learning models. 

In this module, you'll learn to: 

- Identify the machine learning process.
- Understand Azure Machine Learning capabilities. 
- Use automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning studio to train and deploy a predictive model.

To complete this module, you'll need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).
