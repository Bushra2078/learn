*Machine Learning* is the foundation for most artificial intelligence solutions, and the creation of an intelligent solution often begins with the use of machine learning to train a predictive model using historic data that you have collected.

*Azure Machine Learning* is a cloud service that you can use to train and manage machine learning models. 

In this module, you'll learn how to: 

- Identify different kinds of machine learning model.
- Use the automated machine learning capability of Azure Machine Learning to train and deploy a predictive model.

To complete this module, you'll need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).
