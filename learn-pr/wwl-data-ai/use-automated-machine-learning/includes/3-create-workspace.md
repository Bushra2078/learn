Data scientists expend a lot of effort exploring and pre-processing data, and trying various types of model-training algorithms to produce accurate models, which is time consuming, and often makes inefficient use of expensive compute hardware.

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based platform for building and operating machine learning solutions in Azure. It includes a wide range of features and capabilities that help data scientists prepare data, train models, publish predictive services, and monitor their usage. Most importantly, it helps data scientists increase their efficiency by automating many of the time-consuming tasks associated with training models; and it enables them to use cloud-based compute resources that scale effectively to handle large volumes of data while incurring costs only when actually used.

## Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

To use Azure Machine Learning, you create a *workspace* in your Azure subscription. You can then use this workspace to manage data, compute resources, code, models, and other artifacts related to your machine learning workloads.

> [!NOTE]
> This module is one of many that make use of an Azure Machine Learning workspace, including the other modules in the [Create no-code predictive models with Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-no-code-predictive-models-azure-machine-learning/) learning path. If you are using your own Azure subscription, consider creating the workspace once and reusing it in other modules. After completing each module, be sure to follow the **Clean Up** instructions at the end of the module to stop compute resources.

If you don't already have one, follow these steps to create a workspace:

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) using the Microsoft credentials associated woth your Azure subscription.
2. Select **&#65291;Create a resource**, search for *Machine Learning*, and create a new **Machine Learning** resource the following settings:
    - **Workspace Name**: *A unique name of your choice*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Create a new resource group with a unique name*
    - **Location**: *Choose any available location*
3. Wait for your workspace to be created (it can take a few minutes). Then go to it in the portal.
4. On the **Overview** page for your workspace, launch Azure Machine Learning studio (or open a new browser tab and navigate to [https://ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com?azure-portal=true)), and sign into Azure Machine Learning studio using your Microsoft account. If prompted, select your Azure directory and subscription, and your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
5. In Azure Machine Learning studio, toggle the &#9776; icon at the top left to view the various pages in the interface. You can use these pages to manage the resources in your workspace.

You can manage your workspace using the Azure portal, but for data scientists and Machine Learning operations engineers, Azure Machine Learning studio provides a more focused user interface for managing workspace resources.
