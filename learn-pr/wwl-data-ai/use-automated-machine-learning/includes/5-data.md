Machine learning models must be trained with existing data. In this case, you'll use a dataset of historical bicycle rental details to train a model that predicts the number of bicycle rentals that should be expected on a given day, based on seasonal and meteorological features.

## Create a dataset

In Azure Machine Learning, data for model training and other operations is usually encapsulated in an object called a *dataset*.

1. View the comma-separated data at [https://aka.ms/bike-rentals](https://aka.ms/bike-rentals?azure-portal=true) in your web browser. 

2. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com?azure-portal=true), view the **Datasets** page. Datasets represent specific data files or tables that you plan to work with in Azure ML.
3. Create a new dataset **from web files**, using the following settings:
    * **Basic Info**:
        * **Name**: bike-rentals
        * **Dataset type**: Tabular
        * **Description**: Bicycle rental data
    * **Datastore and file selection**
        * **Select or create a datastore**: *do not change*
        * **Create new datastore**: *do not change*
        * **Select files for your dataset**: select [https://aka.ms/bike-rentals](https://aka.ms/bike-rentals?azure-portal=true) to download the data file. Then select the csv file to upload. 
        * **Skip data validation**: *do not select*
    * **Settings and preview**:
        * **File format**: Delimited
        * **Delimiter**: Comma
        * **Encoding**: UTF-8
        * **Column headers**: Only first file has headers 
        * **Skip rows**: None
        * **Dataset contains multi-line data**: _Do not select_ 
    * **Schema**:
        * Include all columns other than **Path**
        * Review the automatically detected types
    * **Confirm details**:
        * Do not profile the dataset after creation

4. After the dataset has been created, open it and view the **Explore** page to see a sample of the data. This data contains historical features and labels for bike rentals.
