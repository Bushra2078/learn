In this module, you explored machine learning and learned how to use the automated machine learning capability of Azure Machine Learning to train and deploy a predictive model.

## Clean-up

The web service you created is hosted in an *Azure Container Instance*. If you don't intend to experiment with it further, you should delete the endpoint to avoid accruing unnecessary Azure charges. You should also stop the training cluster and compute instance resources until you need them again.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com?azure-portal=true), on the **Endpoints** tab, select the **predict-rentals** endpoint. Then select **Delete** (&#128465;) and confirm that you want to delete the endpoint.
2. On the **Compute** page, on the **Compute Instances** tab, select your compute instance and then select **Stop**.
3. On the **Compute** page, on the **Compute clusters** tab, open your compute cluster and select **Edit**. Then set the **Minimum number of nodes** setting to **0** and select **Update**.

If you have finished exploring Azure Machine Learning, you can delete the resource group containing your Azure Machine Learning workspace from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.
