Summarization is a powerful technique that condenses lengthy articles, papers, or documents into key sentences and concepts. In this module, you explored extractive, abstractive, and query-focused summarization methods using the `azure_ai` extension for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server, Azure AI Services, and Azure OpenAI.

Now that you completed this module, you should be better able to:

- Describe and explain the differences between the various summarization techniques accessible through the `azure_ai` extension and Azure AI services.
- Apply generative AI summarization techniques to data in a PostgreSQL database using the `azure_ai` extension.
