  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which parameter controls the number of sentences returned in document extractive summarization using the `azure_ai` extension's `summarize_extractive()` function?"
    choices:
    - content: "sentenceCount"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The sentenceCount parameter guides how many sentences are returned in the extractive summarization process. The default value is 3, and the range is from 1 to 20."
    - content: "summaryLength"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This parameter doesn't exist on the `summarize_extractive()` function."
    - content: "maxSentences"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This parameter doesn't exist on the `summarize_extractive()` function."
  - content: "What are the two summarization techniques accessible through the `azure_ai` extension for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server?"
    choices:
    - content: "Abstractive and query-focused summarization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure AI extension for PostgreSQL doesn't support the query-focused summarization technique. This requires the use for Azure OpenAI."
    - content: "Abstractive and extractive summarization"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure AI extension for PosgreSQL supports both abstractive and extractive summarization techniques."
    - content: "Extractive and query-focused summarization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure AI extension for PostgreSQL doesn't support the query-focused summarization technique. This requires the use for Azure OpenAI."
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of query-focused summarization in Azure OpenAI-powered language models?"
    choices:
    - content: "To generate concise summaries of call center conversations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Call center conversation summarization is a separate use case, not the primary purpose of query-focused summarization."
    - content: "To refine the query mechanism using semantic search methods"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While semantic search methods are used, the primary goal is to provide relevant content to user queries, not specifically to refine the query mechanism."
    - content: "To provide relevant content based on user queries"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Query-focused summarization aims to return relevant content based on user queries. It refines the query mechanism by using semantic search methods to find relevant information."
