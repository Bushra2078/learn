Imagine you trained a model. The next step is to operationalize the model and to make sure whoever needs the predictions can consume them. 

**Machine Learning operations** or **MLOps** help you to scale your model from a proof of concept or pilot project to production. A model in production is ready for large-scale deployment and is retrained and redeployed when necessary.

Implementing MLOps helps you to make your machine learning workloads robust and reproducible.

You'll learn about a typical MLOps architecture and what you need to consider to bring a model to production.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Explore an MLOps architecture.
- Design for monitoring.
- Design for retraining.
