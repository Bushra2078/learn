Slowly changing dimensions (SCD) are tables in a dimensional model that handle changes to dimension values over time. Learning the best practices to design and load slowly changing dimensions will help you successfully handle changes in your data.

In this module, you will learn about SCD types that are
commonly used to manage changes to dimension members over time.
Then you will create a mapping data flow that can incrementally update a slowly changing dimension table in a dedicated SQL pool.

In this module, you will be able to:

* Understand slowly changing dimensions and their use cases
* Understand common slowly changing dimension types and when to use them
* Design and implement a Type 1 slowly changing dimension type
with mapping data flows

Before taking this module, it is recommended that you can:

* Log into the Azure portal
* Create a Synapse Analytics Workspace
* Create and connect to an Azure Synapse Analytics SQL pool
