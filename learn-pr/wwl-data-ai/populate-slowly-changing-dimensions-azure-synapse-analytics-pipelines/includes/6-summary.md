You have just learned how to design and implement slowly changing dimensions (SCD) to manage changes to dimension members over time.

In this module, you have:

* Learned about slowly changing dimensions and their use cases
* Learned common slowly changing dimension types and when to use them
* Designed and implemented a Type 1 slowly changing dimension type with mapping data flows
