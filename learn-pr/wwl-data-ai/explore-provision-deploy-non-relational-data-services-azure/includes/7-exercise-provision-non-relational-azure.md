In the sample scenario, you've decided to create the following data stores:

- A Cosmos DB for holding information about the volume of items in stock. You need to store current and historic information about volume levels, so you can track how levels vary over time. The data is recorded daily.
- A Data Lake store for holding production and quality data.
- A blob container for holding images of the products the company manufactures.
- File storage for sharing reports. 

In this exercise, you'll provision and configure the Cosmos DB account, and test it by creating a database, a container, and a sample document. You'll also provision an Azure Storage account that can provide blob, file, and Data Lake storage.

You'll perform this exercise using the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure can take as little as 5 minutes or as long as 20 minutes to create the Azure Cosmos DB account.

## Provision and configure a Cosmos DB database and container

### Create a Cosmos DB account

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). 

2. From the left-hand navigation menu in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image From the left-hand navigation menu in the Azure portal. The user has selected **Create a resource**](../media/7-create-resource.png)

3. On the **New** page, select **Azure Cosmos DB**.

    | Account Name | Enter a unique name, such as your initials, the date (in numeric format), and the text *cosmosdbaccount*. For example, *jpws01012020cosmosdbaccount* |
    | Location | Accept the default location |
    | Capacity mode | Provisioned throughput |
    | Apply Free Tier Discount | Do Not Apply |

6. Wait while your settings are validated. If there's a problem, it will be reported at this stage, and you can go back and correct the issue. 

7. Select **Create**. It can take 10 or 15 minutes to create the account.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Validation** page in the Azure portal. The user has selected **Create**](../media/7-create-cosmos-db.png)

### Create a database and a container

1. In the Azure portal, in the left-hand navigation menu, select **All resources**, and then select your Cosmos DB account.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the left-hand navigation menu in the Azure portal. The user has selected **All resources**.](../media/7-resources.png)

2. On the page for your Cosmos DB account, select **Data Explorer**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the Cosmos DB account page. The user has selected **Data Explorer**.](../media/7-cosmos-db-account.png)

3. On the **Data Explorer** page, select **New Container**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Data Explorer** page. The user has selected **New Container**.](../media/7-data-explorer.png)

4. In the **Add Container** dialog box, create a new container with the following values, and then select **OK**:

    | Field | Value |
    |-|-|
    | Database ID | Select **Create new**, and enter **contosodb** |
    | Share throughput accross containers | Check |
    | Throughput | Select **Manual**, and specify 400 RU/s (the default) |
    | Container ID | **productvolumes** |
    | Partition key | **/productid** (Each product will have a new level recorded each day. Partitioning by product ID enables you to quickly report how the levels for a product vary over time.) |
    | My partition key is larger than 100 bytes| Leave unchecked |



    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Add Container** dialog box. The user has provided the parameters for a new database and container.](../media/7-container.png)

5. In the **Data Explorer** window. Expand **contosodb**, expand **productvolumes**, and then click **Items**. The container should currently be empty.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Data Explorer** window after the **contosodb** database has been created. The user is viewing the items in the **productvolumes** container.](../media/7-empty-items.png)

6. Select **New Item** to create a new document.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Items** page for the **customers** container. The user has selected **New Item**.](../media/7-new-item.png)

7. Replace the text that appears in the document window with the following JSON document. This is an example document showing the amount of product 99 in stock on 01/01/2020.

    ```JSON
    {
        "productid": 99,
        "date": "01/01/2020",
        "in-stock": 500
    }
    ```

8. Select **Save**. The document will be added to the container. The new document will have some additional fields that Cosmos DB uses to track and manage the document. You can ignore these fields for now.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the new document, including the fields added by Cosmos DB.](../media/7-new-document.png)


You've now provisioned a new Cosmos DB account, and created a database and container.

## Provision Azure Storage

### Create an Azure Storage account for Data Lake Storage

1. On the left-hand navigation menu in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**.

2. On the **New** page, select **Storage account**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **New** page in the Azure portal. The user has selected **Storage account - blob, file, table, queue**](../media/7-new-page-2.png)

3. On the **Create storage account** page, on the **Basics** tabs, enter the details of the account using the values in the following table:

    | Field | Value |
    |-|-|
    | Subscription | Concierge Subscription |
    | Resource Group | [sandbox resource group] |
    | Storage account Name | Enter a unique name, such as your initials, the date (in numeric format), and the text *storage*. For example, *jpws01012020storage* |

    > ![Image of the **Advanced** page in the Azure portal. The user has enabled Data Lake Storage](../media/7-advanced.png)

5. If your settings are validated correctly, select **Create**. 

    It takes approximately 15-20 seconds for the storage account to be provisioned.

### Create a container for Data Lake storage

1. In the Azure portal, on the left-hand navigation menu, select **All resources**, and then select your storage account.

2. On the page for your storage account, under **Data Storage**, select **Containers**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the storage account page. The user has selected **Containers** under **Data Lake Storage**.](../media/7-data-lake-containers.png)

3. On the **Containers** page, select **+ Container**, and create a new container named **productqualitydata**. Leave the **Public access level** set to **Private (no anonymous access)**, and then click **Create**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the storage account page. The user is creating a new Data Lake Storage container named **productqualitydata**.](../media/7-new-dl-container.png)

4. When the container has been created, double-click the **productqualitydata** container.

5. On the **productqualitydata** page, click **+ Add Directory**, and add a directory named **plantA** and click **Save**.

6. Add a second directory named **plantB** and click **Save**.

    Contoso has two manufacturing plants named *Plant A* and *Plant B*. Other applications will upload manufacturing data from each of these plants to the appropriate directory for later analysis.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **productqualitydata** page. The user has created two directories named **plantA** and **plantB**.](../media/7-directories.png) 


### Create a container for Blob storage

1. In the Azure portal, on the left-hand navigation menu, select **All resources**, and then select your storage account.

2. On the **Overview** page, select **Containers**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Overview** page for the storage account. The user has selected **Containers**.](../media/7-blob-containers.png)

3. On the **Containers** page, select **+ Container**, and create a new container named **images**. Set the **Public access level** to **Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Containers** page for the storage account. The user is creating a new container named images.](../media/7-create-blob-container.png)

    Contoso will use this container to hold product images.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The container created for Data Lake Storage will also appear in the **Containers** page. You could store image data in a Data Lake Storage container, but Contoso want to keep the images separate from product quality data. 

### Create a file share

1. On the storage account page, under **Data storage** select **File shares**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Overview** page for the storage account. The user has selected **File shares**.](../media/7-file-shares.png)


2. On the **File shares** page, select **+ File share**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **File shares** page for the storage account. The user has selected **+ File share**.](../media/7-new-file-share.png)

3. Create a new file share named **reports**. Leave the **Tier** as **Transaction optimized**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **New file share** dialog box. The user has entered the name of the new file share.](../media/7-create-file-share.png)

4. On the **File shares** page, double-click the **reports** file share.
