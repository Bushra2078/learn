Microsoft Azure supports a number of non-relational data services, including Azure File storage, Azure Blob storage, Azure Data Lake Store, and Azure Cosmos DB. These services support different types of non-relational data. For example, you can use Cosmos DB to store documents, and Blob storage as a repository for large binary objects such as video and audio data. 

Before you can use a service, you must provision an instance of that service. You can then configure the service to enable you to store and retrieve data, and to make it accessible to the users and applications that require it.

Suppose you're a data engineer working at Contoso, an organization with a large manufacturing operation. The organization has to gather and store information from a range of sources, such as real-time data monitoring the status of production line machinery, product quality control data, historical production logs, product volumes in stock, and raw materials inventory data. This information is critical to the operation of the organization. Contoso has decided to store this information in various non-relational databases, according to the different data processing requirements for each dataset. You've been asked to provision a range of Azure data services to enable applications to store and process the information.
