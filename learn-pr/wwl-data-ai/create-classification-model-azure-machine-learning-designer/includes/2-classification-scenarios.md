*Classification* is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or *class*, an item belongs to. This machine learning technique can be applied to binary and multi-class scenarios. For example, a health clinic might use the characteristics of a patient (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to predict whether the patient is at risk of diabetes. In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the *features*, and the *label* is a binary classification of either **0** or **1**, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.

Like regression, classification is an example of a *supervised* machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to *fit* the feature combinations to the label. Then, after training has been completed, you can use the trained model to predict labels for new items for which the label is unknown.

## Scenarios for classification machine learning models 

Classification machine learning models are used in many industries. A few scenarios are: 

* Using clinical data to predict whether a patient will become sick or not.  
* Using historical data to predict whether text sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.   
* Using characteristics of small businesses to predict if a new venture will succeed.
