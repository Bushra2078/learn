Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based platform for building and operating machine learning solutions in Azure. It includes a wide range of features and capabilities that help data scientists prepare data, train models, publish predictive services, and monitor their usage. One of these features is a visual interface called *designer*, that you can use to train, test, and deploy machine learning models without writing any code.

*Classification* is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or *class*, an item belongs to. For example, a health clinic might use the characteristics of a patient (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to predict whether the patient is at risk of diabetes. In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the *features*, and the *label* is a classification of either **0** or **1**, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.

Like regression, classification is an example of a *supervised* machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to *fit* the feature combinations to the label. Then, after training has been completed, you can use the trained model to predict labels for new items for which the label is unknown.

## Scenarios for classification machine learning models 

Classification machine learning models are used in many industries. A few common scenarios for using classification machine learning models are: 

* Using clinical data to predict whether a patient will become diabetic or not.  
* Using past data on grocery store sales and food waste to predict whether the store will be successful or not.   
* Using characteristics of small businesses to determine if a new venture will succeed.
