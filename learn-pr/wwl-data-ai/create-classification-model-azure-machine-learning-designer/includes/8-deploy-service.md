After you've created and tested an inference pipeline for real-time inferencing, you can publish it as a service for client applications to use.

> [!NOTE]
> In this exercise, you'll deploy the web service to an Azure Container Instance (ACI). This type of compute is created dynamically, and is useful for development and testing. For production, you should create an *inference cluster*, which provide an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster that provides better scalability and security.

## Deploy a service

1. View the **Predict Diabetes** inference pipeline you created in the previous unit.
2. At the top right, select **Deploy**, and deploy a new real-time endpoint, using the following settings:
    -  **Name**: predict-diabetes
    -  **Description**: Classify diabetes.
    - **Compute type**: Azure Container Instance
3. Wait for the web service to be deployed - this can take several minutes. The deployment status is shown at the top left of the designer interface.

## Test the service

Now you can test your deployed service from a client application - in this case, you'll use the code in the cell below to simulate a client application.

1. On the **Endpoints** page, open the **predict-diabetes** real-time endpoint.
2. When the **predict-diabetes** endpoint opens, view the **Consume** tab and note the following information there. You need this to connect to your deployed service from a client application.
    - The REST endpoint for your service
    - the Primary Key for your service
3. Note that you can use the &#10697; link next to these values to copy them to the clipboard.
4. With the **Consume** page for the **predict-diabetes** service page open in your browser, open a new browser tab and open a second instance of [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com?azure-portal=true). Then in the new tab, view the **Notebooks** page (under **Author**).
5. In the **Notebooks** page, under **My files**, use the **&#128459;** button to create a new file with the following settings:
    - **File location**: Users/*your user name*
    - **File name**: Test-Diabetes
    - **File type**: Notebook
    - **Overwrite if already exists**: Selected
6. When the new notebook has been created, ensure that the compute instance you created previously is selected in the **Compute** box, and that it has a status of **Running**.
7. Use the **&#8810;** button to collapse the file explorer pane and give you more room to focus on the **Test-Diabetes.ipynb** notebook tab.
8. In the rectangular cell that has been created in the notebook, paste the following code:

    ```Python
    endpoint = 'YOUR_ENDPOINT' #Replace with your endpoint
    key = 'YOUR_KEY' #Replace with your key

    import urllib.request
    import json
    import os

    data = {
        "Inputs": {
            "WebServiceInput0":
            [
                {
                        'PatientID': 1882185,
                        'Pregnancies': 9,
                        'PlasmaGlucose': 104,
                        'DiastolicBloodPressure': 51,
                        'TricepsThickness': 7,
                        'SerumInsulin': 24,
                        'BMI': 27.36983156,
                        'DiabetesPedigree': 1.3504720469999998,
                        'Age': 43
                },
            ],
        },
        "GlobalParameters":  {
        }
    }

    body = str.encode(json.dumps(data))


    headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json', 'Authorization':('Bearer '+ key)}

    req = urllib.request.Request(endpoint, body, headers)

    try:
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
        result = response.read()
        json_result = json.loads(result)
        output = json_result["Results"]["WebServiceOutput0"][0]
        print('Patient: {}\nPrediction: {}\nProbability: {:.2f}'.format(output["PatientID"],
                                                                output["DiabetesPrediction"],
                                                                output["Probability"]))
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as error:
        print("The request failed with status code: " + str(error.code))

        # Print the headers to help debug
        print(error.info())
        print(json.loads(error.read().decode("utf8", 'ignore')))
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Don't worry too much about the details of the code. It just defines features for a patient, and uses the **predict-diabetes** service you created to predict a diabetes diagnosis.

9. Switch to the browser tab containing the **Consume** page for the **predict-diabetes** service, and copy the REST endpoint for your service. The switch back to the tab containing the notebook and paste the key into the code, replacing YOUR_ENDPOINT.
10. Switch to the browser tab containing the **Consume** page for the **predict-diabetes** service, and copy the Primary Key for your service. The switch back to the tab containing the notebook and paste the key into the code, replacing YOUR_KEY.
11. Save the notebook. Then use the **&#9655;** button next to the cell to run the code.
12. Verify that predicted diabetes diagnosis is returned.
