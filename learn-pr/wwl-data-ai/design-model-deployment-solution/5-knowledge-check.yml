  questions:
  - content: "What type of predictions are needed by the mobile application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Real-time predictions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. There's a need for immediate predictions for individual patients."
    - content: "Batch predictions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Batch predictions would take too long. We need immediate predictions."
    - content: "Local predictions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's a need for immediate predictions for individual patients so we need real-time predictions."
  - content: "What kind of compute should be used by the deployed model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machine will be too expensive to have running all the time. Containers will be a more cost-effective solution."
    - content: "Containers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Containers will be the more cost-effective solution as we want the model to be always available and respond immediately."
    - content: "Local device"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A local device will be too expensive to have running all the time. Containers will be a more cost-effective solution."
