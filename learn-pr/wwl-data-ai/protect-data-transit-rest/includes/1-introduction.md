This module explores the encryption options available within Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. Each of the various platforms support different database encryption options. In this module students will explore these data encryption options and how to configure them.

Consider the following three scenarios when evaluating data encryption methods:

| Scenario | Definition |
|------------|-------------|
|**Data at rest** | Encrypting it while it's on file storage. |
|**Data in transit** | Encrypting it while it travels through private or public network communication channels. |
|**Data in use** | Encrypting it while it's in RAM or CPU caches. |
