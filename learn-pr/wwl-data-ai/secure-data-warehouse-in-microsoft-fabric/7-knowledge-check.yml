  questions:
  - content: What is the primary advantage of Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)?
    choices:
    - content: It limits data exposure by obscuring sensitive information in real time.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. DDM enhances security by applying dynamic masking to sensitive data in real time, thus preventing exposure to unauthorized users.
    - content: It changes the actual data in the database.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. DDM does not change the actual data in the database, it only masks it in query results.
    - content: It requires complex coding to implement.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. DDM is straightforward to implement and doesnâ€™t require complex coding.
  - content: What is the purpose of a security predicate function in Row-Level Security (RLS)?
    choices:
    - content: It determines whether a row is accessible to a user based on certain conditions.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The security predicate function in RLS is defined to return true or false based on certain conditions, typically involving the values of one or more columns in the table.
    - content: It enables type conversions in predicate functions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The security predicate function does not enable type conversions. It returns true or false based on certain conditions, typically involving the values of one or more columns in the table.
    - content: It allows users to run ad hoc queries.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The security predicate function does not allow users to run ad hoc queries. It determines whether a row is accessible to a user based on certain conditions.
  - content: What happens when a user is granted a permission and then denied the same permission in a warehouse?
    choices:
    - content: The GRANT statement will supersede the DENY, and the user will have access to the specific object.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. If a user is granted a permission and then denied the same permission, the DENY will always supersede the GRANT.
    - content: The DENY will always supersede the GRANT, and the user will be denied access to the specific object.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. If a user is granted a permission and then denied the same permission, the DENY will always supersede the GRANT.
    - content: The user will have both permissions, and it will cause a conflict in the system.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. There won't be a conflict. The DENY statement will always supersede the GRANT statement.
  - content: What is required to secure a warehouse in Microsoft Fabric?
    choices:
    - content: A Microsoft Fabric trial license with the Fabric preview enabled in your tenant
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. This setup allows access to the necessary features to secure a warehouse in Microsoft Fabric.
    - content: A standard Microsoft Fabric license
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A standard license does not provide access to the Fabric preview needed for this task.
    - content: A Microsoft Fabric trial license without the Fabric preview enabled
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Fabric preview must be enabled in the tenant for this task.
