  questions:
  - content: "In the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, how should you configure the **CosmosClientOptions.ConnectionMode** property so that your application can use the integrated cache?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure the connectivity mode to ``ConnectionMode.Direct``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The direct connectivity mode will bypass the dedicated gateway."
    - content: "Configure the connectivity mode to ``ConnectionMode.Gateway``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The gateway connectivity mode will correctly use the dedicated gateway and is part of an overall solution to enable the integrated cache."
    - content: "Leave the connectivity mode to the default value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The default setting is to use the direct connectivity mode, which will bypass the dedicated gateway."
  - content: "Which property of the **ItemRequestOptions** class should you configure to manually adjust how long items will remain in the cache?"
    choices:
    - content: "``SessionToken``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Getting the session token will not influence the time items remain in the cache."
    - content: "``ConsistencyLevel``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Setting the consistency level correctly is a part of enabling the integrated cache, but it does not influence the time items remain in the cache."
    - content: "``DedicatedGatewayRequestOptions.MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The ``MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness`` property will configure a **TimeSpan** that is used to determine how long items will remain in the cache."
