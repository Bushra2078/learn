Read-heavy workloads can run into situations where small request unit charges can add up in the aggregate and cause the developer team to write custom code to cache the response of read operations and queries. Implementing a client-side cache can become cumbersome quickly, and the integrated cache feature of Azure Cosmos DB is a solution to enable caching without having to write custom code. In this module, you will learn about the integrated cache, its configuration, and strategies to monitor it.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Implement the integrated cache
- Configure integrated cache options
