Data is the foundation of machine learning. Both data quantity and data quality will affect the model’s accuracy.
 
When you want to train a machine learning model, you need to get access to the data you’ll use. Often, you’ll have to clean and transform the data before it’s ready to be used for training. 

Before you start experimenting with machine learning models, you should have access to the data. You'll therefore need to identify the data sources, and which tools you want to use to load and transform the data.

You'll learn how to design a data ingestion strategy for machine learning projects.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Identify your data source and format
- Choose how to serve data to machine learning workflows
- Design a data ingestion solution
