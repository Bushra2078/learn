Modern applications require a data platform that is always online and near end users. Azure Cosmos DB is globally distributed by its design-allowing scenarios where data can be at data centers closer to end-users and scenarios where data is still available despite regional outages. In this module, you'll explore the various replication options for Azure Cosmos DB.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Distribute data across global data centers
- Configure automatic failover and do a manual failover
- Configure the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API .NET SDK to use a specific region
