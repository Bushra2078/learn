  questions:
  - content: "You want to use the Computer Vision service to analyze images. You also want to use the Text Analytics service to analyze text. You want developers to require only one key and endpoint to access all of your services. What kind of resource should you create in your Azure subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Computer Vision"
