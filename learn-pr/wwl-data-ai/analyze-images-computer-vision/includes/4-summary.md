Azure AI Vision service provides many capabilities that you can use to analyze images, including generating a descriptive caption, extracting relevant tags, identifying objects, determining image type and metadata, detecting human faces, known brands, and celebrities, and others.

You can find out more about using the Azure AI Vision service in the [service documentation](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview?azure-portal=true).

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
