*Computer vision* is one of the core areas of artificial intelligence (AI), and focuses on creating solutions that enable AI-enabled applications to "see" the world and make sense of it.

Of course, computers don't have biological eyes that work the way ours do, but they are capable of processing images; either from a live camera feed or from digital photographs or videos. This ability to process images is the key to creating software that can emulate human visual perception.

To an AI application, an image is just an array of pixel values. These numeric values can be used as *features* to train machine learning models that make predictions about the image and its contents.

In Microsoft Azure, the **Computer Vision** cognitive service uses pre-trained models to analyze images, enabling software developers to easily build applications that can:

- Interpret an image and suggest an appropriate caption.
- Suggest relevant *tags* that could be used to index an image.
- Categorize an image.
- Identify objects in an image.
- Detect faces and people in an image.
- Recognize celebrities and landmarks in an image.
- Read text in an image.

In this module, you'll explore some of these capabilities as you learn how to use the Computer Vision service to analyze images.
