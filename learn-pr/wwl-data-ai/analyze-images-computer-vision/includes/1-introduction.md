*Computer vision* is one of the core areas of artificial intelligence (AI), and focuses on creating solutions that enable AI applications to "see" the world and make sense of it.

Of course, computers don't have biological eyes that work the way ours do, but they are capable of processing images; either from a live camera feed or from digital photographs or videos. This ability to process images is the key to creating software that can emulate human visual perception.

Some potential uses for computer vision include:

- **Content Organization**: Identify people or objects in photos and organize them based on that identification. Photo recognition applications like this are commonly used in photo storage and social media applications. 
- **Text Extraction**: Analyze images and PDF documents that contain text and extract the text into a structured format.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Identify people or objects, such as cars, in a space and map their movement within that space.

To an AI application, an image is just an array of pixel values. These numeric values can be used as *features* to train machine learning models that make predictions about the image and its contents.

Training machine learning models from scratch can be very time intensive and require a large amount of data. Microsoft's Azure AI Vision service gives you access to pre-trained computer vision capabilities.  

## Learning objectives 
In this module you will: 
- Identify image analysis tasks that can be performed with the Azure AI Vision service.
- Provision a Computer Vision resource.
- Use a Computer Vision resource to analyze an image.
