Microsoft's Azure AI Vision service provides prebuilt and customizable computer vision capabilities. The Image Analysis service can analyze images, and return detailed information about an image and the objects it depicts.

## Azure resources for Azure AI Vision service

To use Azure AI Vision, you need to create a resource for it in your Azure subscription. You can use either of the following resource types:

- **Azure AI Vision**: A specific resource for the Computer Vision service. Use this resource type if you don't intend to use any other cognitive services, or if you want to track utilization and costs for your Azure AI Vision resource separately.
- **Azure AI services**: A general resource that includes Azure AI Vision along with many other Azure AI services; such as Azure AI Language, Azure AI Custom Vision, Azure AI Translator, and others. Use this resource type if you plan to use multiple AI services and want to simplify administration and development.

## Analyzing images with the Azure AI Vision service

After you've created a suitable resource in your subscription, you can submit images to the Azure AI Vision service to perform a wide range of analytical tasks.

Azure AI Vision's Image Analysis 4.0 supports these features:
- Optical Character Recognition
- Captions, including Dense Captions
- Tagging visual features
- Object detection 
- People
- Smart crop
- Custom image classification and object detection

These tasks can be preformed in the [**Vision Studio**](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/gallery/featured?azure-portal=true), a user interface for testing service features without needing to write any code.

Let's take a deeper look at Azure AI Vision's Image Analysis features. 

### Optical character recognition

Azure AI Vision service can use optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities to detect printed and handwritten text in images. This capability is explored in the [following module](/learn/modules/read-text-computer-vision/) on Microsoft Learn.

### Describing an image with captions

Azure AI Vision has the ability to analyze an image, evaluate the objects that are detected, and generate a human-readable phrase or sentence that can describe what was detected in the image. Depending on the image contents, the service may return multiple results, or phrases. Each returned phrase will have an associated confidence score, indicating how confident the algorithm is in the supplied description. The highest confidence phrases will be listed first.

To help you understand this concept, consider the following image of the Empire State building in New York. The returned phrases are listed below the image in the order of confidence.

- A black and white photo of a city.
- A black and white photo of a large city.
- A large white building in a city.

### Tagging visual features

The image descriptions generated by Azure AI Vision are based on a set of thousands of recognizable objects, which can be used to suggest *tags* for the image. These tags can be associated with the image as metadata that summarizes attributes of the image and can be particularly useful if you want to index an image along with a set of key terms that might be used to search for images with specific attributes or contents.

For example, the tags returned for the Empire State building image include:

- skyscraper
- tower
- building

### Detecting objects

The object detection capability is similar to tagging, in that the service can identify common objects; but rather than tagging, or providing tags for the recognized objects only, this service can also return what is known as bounding box coordinates. Not only will you get the type of object, but you will also receive a set of coordinates that indicate the top, left, width, and height of the object detected, which you can use to identify the location of the object in the image, like this:

### Detecting people

Azure AI Vision can detect and analyze people with a bounding box rectangle for the location of the face(s). The facial analysis capabilities of Azure AI Vision service are a subset of those provided by the dedicated [Face service](/azure/cognitive-services/face/). If you need basic face detection you can use the Azure AI Vision service; but for more comprehensive facial analysis and facial recognition functionality, use the Face service.
