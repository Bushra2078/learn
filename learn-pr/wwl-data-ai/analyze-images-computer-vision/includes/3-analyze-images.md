The best way to learn about the capabilities of the Computer Vision service is to explore it for yourself.

In this exercise, you'll use a *Visual Studio Online* environment:

1. Follow the instructions at [https://aka.ms/learn-ai-fundamentals](https://aka.ms/learn-ai-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to set up your environment - this should take a few minutes.
2. When your environment is ready, open the **Image Analysis with Computer Vision.ipynb** notebook file. This notebook contains notes, instructions, and code that you can run to see the Computer Vision service in action.
3. When you're finished, you can delete the Visual Studio Online environment - or keep it if you want to explore further.
