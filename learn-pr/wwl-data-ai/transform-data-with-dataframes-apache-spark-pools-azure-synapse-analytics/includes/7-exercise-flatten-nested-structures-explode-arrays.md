In order to go through this exercise, it require a set-up with instructions that can be found here:
[Set up](https://github.com/ctesta-oneillmsft/asa-vtd)

* PySpark contains a special [`explode` function](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/api/python/pyspark.sql.html?highlight=explode#pyspark.sql.functions.explode#pyspark.sql.functions.explode), which returns a new row for each element of the array. This will help flatten the `topProductPurchases` column for better readability or for easier querying. Execute the following in a new cell:

    ```python
    from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, explode

    flat=df.select('visitorId',explode('topProductPurchases').alias('topProductPurchases_flat'))
    flat.show(100)
    ```

    In this cell, we created a new dataframe named `flat` that includes the `visitorId` field and a new aliased field named `topProductPurchases_flat`. As you can see, the output is a bit easier to read and, by extension, easier to query.

    ![The improved output is displayed.](../media/spark-explode-output.png "Spark explode output")

* Create a new cell and execute the following code to create a new flattened version of the dataframe that extracts the `topProductPurchases_flat.productId` and `topProductPurchases_flat.itemsPurchasedLast12Months` fields to create new rows for each data combination:

    ```python
    topPurchases = (flat.select('visitorId','topProductPurchases_flat.productId','topProductPurchases_flat.itemsPurchasedLast12Months')
        .orderBy('visitorId'))

    topPurchases.show(100)
    ```

    In the output, notice that we now have multiple rows for each `visitorId`.

    ![The vistorId rows are highlighted.](../media/spark-top-purchases-output.png "topPurchases output")

* Let's order the rows by the number of items purchased in the last 12 months. Create a new cell and execute the following code:

    ```python
    # Let's order by the number of items purchased in the last 12 months
    sortedTopPurchases = topPurchases.orderBy("itemsPurchasedLast12Months")

    display(sortedTopPurchases.limit(100))
    ```

    ![The result is displayed.](../media/sorted-12-months.png "Sorted result set")

* How do we sort in reverse order? One might conclude that we could make a call like this: `topPurchases.orderBy("itemsPurchasedLast12Months desc")`. Try it in a new cell:

    ```python
    topPurchases.orderBy("itemsPurchasedLast12Months desc")
    ```

    ![An error is displayed.](../media/sort-desc-error.png "Sort desc error")

    Notice that there is an `AnalysisException` error, because `itemsPurchasedLast12Months desc` does not match up with a column name.

    Why does this not work?

    - The `DataFrames` API is built upon an SQL engine.
    - There is a lot of familiarity with this API and SQL syntax in general.
    - The problem is that `orderBy(..)` expects the name of the column.
    - What we specified was an SQL expression in the form of **requests desc**.
    - What we need is a way to programmatically express such an expression.
    - This leads us to the second variant, `orderBy(Column)` and more specifically, the class `Column`.

* The **Column** class is an object that encompasses more than just the name of the column, but also column-level-transformations, such as sorting in a descending order. Execute the following code in a new cell:

    ```python
    sortedTopPurchases = (topPurchases
        .orderBy( col("itemsPurchasedLast12Months").desc() ))

    display(sortedTopPurchases.limit(100))
    ```

    Notice that the results are now sorted by the `itemsPurchasedLast12Months` column in descending order, thanks to the **`desc()`** method on the **`col`** object.

    ![The results are sorted in descending order.](../media/sort-desc-col.png "Sort desc")

* How many *types* of products did each customer purchase? To figure this out, we need to group by `visitorId` and aggregate on the number of rows per customer. Execute the following code in a new cell:

    ```python
    groupedTopPurchases = (sortedTopPurchases.select("visitorId")
        .groupBy("visitorId")
        .agg(count("*").alias("total"))
        .orderBy("visitorId") )

    display(groupedTopPurchases.limit(100))
    ```

    Notice how we use the **`groupBy`** method on the `visitorId` column, and the **`agg`** method over a count of records to display the total for each customer.

    ![The query output is displayed.](../media/spark-grouped-top-purchases.png "Grouped top purchases output")

* How many *total items* did each customer purchase? To figure this out, we need to group by `visitorId` and aggregate on the sum of `itemsPurchasedLast12Months` values per customer. Execute the following code in a new cell:

    ```python
    groupedTopPurchases = (sortedTopPurchases.select("visitorId","itemsPurchasedLast12Months")
        .groupBy("visitorId")
        .agg(sum("itemsPurchasedLast12Months").alias("totalItemsPurchased"))
        .orderBy("visitorId") )

    groupedTopPurchases.show(100)
    ```

    Here we group by `visitorId` once again, but now we use a **`sum`** over the `itemsPurchasedLast12Months` column in the **`agg`** method. Notice that we included the `itemsPurchasedLast12Months` column in the `select` statement so we could use it in the `sum`.
