In this exercise and following exercises we are going to use an example throughout this module using Tailwind Traders. 
However, it does require a set-up with instructions that can be found here:
[Set up](https://github.com/ctesta-oneillmsft/asa-vtd) 
The following usecase will be used:

Tailwind Traders has customer profile data from an e-commerce system that provides top product purchases for each visitor of the site (customer) over the past 12 months. This data is stored within JSON files in the data lake. They have struggled with ingesting, exploring, and transforming these JSON files and want your guidance. The files have a hierarchical structure that they want to flatten before loading into relational data stores. They also wish to apply grouping and aggregate operations as part of the data engineering process.
You recommend using Synapse Notebooks to explore and apply data transformations on the JSON files.

This exercise will focus on how to load data into a spark dataframe. 

* Create a new cell in the Spark notebook, enter the following code and execute the cell:

    ```python
    df = (spark.read \
            .option('inferSchema', 'true') \
            .json('abfss://wwi-02@' + datalake + '.dfs.core.windows.net/online-user-profiles-02/*.json', multiLine=True)
        )

    df.printSchema()
    ```

    > The `datalake` variable we created in the first cell is used here as part of the file path.


    Your output should look like the following:

    ```text
    root
    |-- topProductPurchases: array (nullable = true)
    |    |-- element: struct (containsNull = true)
    |    |    |-- itemsPurchasedLast12Months: long (nullable = true)
    |    |    |-- productId: long (nullable = true)
    |-- visitorId: long (nullable = true)
    ```

    > Notice that we are selecting all JSON files within the `online-user-profiles-02` directory. Each JSON file contains several rows, which is why we specified the `multiLine=True` option. Also, we set the `inferSchema` option to `true`, which instructs the Spark engine to review the files and create a schema based on the nature of the data.

* We have been using Python code in these cells up to this point. If we want to query the files using SQL syntax, one option is to create a temporary view of the data within the dataframe. Execute the following in a new cell to create a view named `user_profiles`:

    ```python
    # create a view called user_profiles
    df.createOrReplaceTempView("user_profiles")
    ```

* Create a new cell. Since we want to use SQL instead of Python, we use the `%%sql` magic to set the language of the cell to SQL. Execute the following code in the cell:

    ```sql
    %%sql

    SELECT * FROM user_profiles LIMIT 10
    ```

    Notice that the output shows nested data for `topProductPurchases`, which includes an array of `productId` and `itemsPurchasedLast12Months` values. You can expand the fields by clicking the right triangle in each row.

    This makes analyzing the data a bit difficult. This is because the JSON file contents look like the following:

    ```json
    [
    {
        "visitorId": 9529082,
        "topProductPurchases": [
        {
            "productId": 4679,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 26
        },
        {
            "productId": 1779,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 32
        },
        {
            "productId": 2125,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 75
        },
        {
            "productId": 2007,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 39
        },
        {
            "productId": 1240,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 31
        },
        {
            "productId": 446,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 39
        },
        {
            "productId": 3110,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 40
        },
        {
            "productId": 52,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 2
        },
        {
            "productId": 978,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 81
        },
        {
            "productId": 1219,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 56
        },
        {
            "productId": 2982,
            "itemsPurchasedLast12Months": 59
        }
        ]
    },
    {
        ...
    },
    {
        ...
    }
    ]
    ```
