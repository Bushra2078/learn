You can use the predefined skills in Azure Cognitive Search to greatly enrich an index by extracting additional information from the source data. However, there may be occasions when you have specific data extraction needs that cannot be met with the predefined skills and require some custom functionality. To support these scenarios, you can implement custom skills as web-hosted services that support the required interface for integration into a skillset.

In this exercise, you'll create a basic custom skill that counts the frequency of each word in a document (excluding *stopwords* like "the", "a", "and", etc.) and returns a list of the top 10 most frequent words.

> [!NOTE]
> The example used here is fairly simple, and designed to enable you to focus on understanding the concept of custom skills, the technique of using an Azure Function to implement a custom skill, and the required JSON schema. In a real-world scenario, your skill could include practically any custom logic.
>
> Commonly, custom skills are used to create "wrappers" around cognitive services for which there are no built-in skills. For example, you could use custom skills to encapsulate logic that:
>
> - Extracts information from digitized forms by using the **Form Recognizer** service.
> - Transcribes audio files to text by using the **Speech** service.
> - Determines the objects that appear in an image by using the **Custom Vision** service.

## Create an Azure Function

To implement your custom skill, you'll create an Azure Function in your preferred language.

:::zone pivot="csharp"

1. In Visual Studio Codespaces, view the Azure Extensions tab (**&boxplus;**), and verify that the **Azure Functions** extension is installed. This extension enables you to create and deploy Azure Functions from Visual Studio Code.
2. On Azure tab (**&Delta;**), in the **Azure Functions** pane, create new Azure Function project (&#128194;) with the following settings:
    - **Folder**: Browse to the **02-Create an enrichment pipeline/C-Sharp/custom-skill** folder
    - **Language**: C#
    - **Template**: HTTP trigger
    - **Function name**: wordcount
    - **Namespace**: margies.search
    - **Authorization level**: Function

    *If you are prompted to overwrite **launch.json**, do so!*

3. Switch back to the **Explorer** (**&#128461;**) tab and verify that a folder named **wordcount** has been added to the **02-Create an enrichment pipeline/C-Sharp/custom-skill** folder. The new folder contains the code files for your Azure Function.
4. Open the **wordcount.cs** file if it is not already open, and replace its entire contents with the following code:

    ```C#

                return resList;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

5. Right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) the **custom-skill** folder and select **Deploy to Function App**. Then deploy the function with the following settings:
    - **Subscription** (if prompted): Select your Azure subscription.
    - **Function**: Create a new Function App in Azure (Advanced)
    - **Function App Name**: Enter a globally unique name.
    - **Runtime**: .NET Core 3.1
    - **OS**: Linux
    - **Hosting plane**: Consumption
    - **Resource group**: Select the existing resource group containing your Cognitive Search, Storage, and Cognitive Services resources (its name will be similar to *rg1234abcd5678efgh*).
    - **Storage account**: Select your existing storage account (its name will be similar to *store1234abcd5678efgh*).
    - **Application Insights**: Skip for now

    *Visual Studio Code will deploy the compiled version of the function (in the **bin** subfolder) based on the configuration settings in the **.vscode** folder that were saved when you created the function project.*

6. Wait for your function app to be created. You can view the **Output Window** to monitor its status.
7. In another browser tab, open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and browse to the resource group where you created the function app. Then open the app service for your function app.
8. In the blade for your app service, on the **Functions** page, open the **wordcount** function.
9. On the **wordcount** function blade, view the **Code + Test** page and open the **Test/Run** pane.
10. In the **Test/Run** pane, replace the existing **Body** with the following JSON, which reflects the schema expected by an Azure Cognitive Search skill in which records containing data for one or more documents are submitted for processing:

    ```json
    {
        "values": [
            {
                "recordId": "a1",
                "data":
                {
                "text":  "Tiger, tiger burning bright in the darkness of the night.",
                "language": "en"
                }
            },
            {
                "recordId": "a2",
                "data":
                {
                "text":  "The rain in spain stays mainly in the plains! That's where you'll find the rain!",
                "language": "en"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

11. Click **Run** and view the HTTP response content that is returned by your function. This reflects the schema expected by Azure Cognitive Search when consuming a skill, in which a response for each document is returned. In this case, the response consists of up to 10 terms in each document in descending order of how frequently they appear:

    ```text
    {
    "values": [
        {
        "recordId": "a1",
        "data": {
            "text": [
            "tiger",
            "burning",
            "bright",
            "darkness",
            "night"
            ]
        },
        "errors": null,
        "warnings": null
        },
        {
        "recordId": "a2",
        "data": {
            "text": [
            "rain",
            "spain",
            "stays",
            "mainly",
            "plains",
            "thats",
            "youll",
            "find"
            ]
        },
        "errors": null,
        "warnings": null
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
12. Close the **Test/Run** pane and in the **wordcount** function blade, click **Get function URL**. Then copy the URL for the default key to the clipboard. You'll need this in the next unit.

                    val["errors"] =[{"message": "An error occurred processing the text."}]
                    val["warnings"] = [{"message": "One or more inputs failed to process."}]
                finally:
                    # Add the value for this record to the response
                    result["values"].append(val)
        except Exception as ex:
            statuscode = 500
            # A global error occurred, so return an error response
            val = {
                    "recordId": None,
                    "data": {
                        "text":None
                    },
                    "errors": [{"message": ex.args}],
                    "warnings": [{"message": "The request failed to process."}]
                }
            result["values"].append(val)
        finally:
            # Return the response
            return func.HttpResponse(body=json.dumps(result), mimetype="application/json", status_code=statuscode)
    ```

5. Refresh the web page to reload the Visual Studio Codespace (*This is required to ensure the function deploys correctly*)
6. After the page has refreshed, right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) the **custom-skill** folder and select **Deploy to Function App**. Then deploy the function with the following settings:
    - **Subscription** (if prompted): Select your Azure subscription.
    - **Function**: Create a new Function App in Azure (Advanced)
    - **Function App Name**: Enter a globally unique name.
    - **Runtime**: Python 3.7
    - **Hosting plane**: Consumption
    - **Resource group**: Select the existing resource group containing your Cognitive Search, Storage, and Cognitive Services resources (its name will be similar to *rg1234abcd5678efgh*).
    - **Storage account**: Select your existing storage account (its name will be similar to *store1234abcd5678efgh*).
    - **Application Insights**: Skip for now
7. Wait for your function app to be created. You can view the **Output Window** to monitor its status.
8. In another browser tab, open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and browse to the resource group where you created the function app. Then open the app service for your function app.
9. In the blade for your app service, on the **Functions** page, open the **wordcount** function.
10. On the **wordcount** function blade, view the **Code + Test** page and open the **Test/Run** pane.
11. In the **Test/Run** pane, replace the existing **Body** with the following JSON, which reflects the schema expected by an Azure Cognitive Search skill in which records containing data for one or more documents are submitted for processing:

    ```json
    {
        "values": [
            {
                "recordId": "a1",
                "data":
                {
                "text":  "Tiger, tiger burning bright in the darkness of the night.",
                "language": "en"
                }
            },
            {
                "recordId": "a2",
                "data":
                {
                "text":  "The rain in spain stays mainly in the plains! That's where you'll find the rain!",
                "language": "en"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

12. Click **Run** and view the HTTP response content that is returned by your function. This reflects the schema expected by Azure Cognitive Search when consuming a skill, in which a response for each document is returned. In this case, the response consists of up to 10 terms in each document in descending order of how frequently they appear:

    ```text
    {
    "values": [
        {
        "recordId": "a1",
        "data": {
            "text": [
            "tiger",
            "burning",
            "bright",
            "darkness",
            "night"
            ]
        },
        "errors": null,
        "warnings": null
        },
        {
        "recordId": "a2",
        "data": {
            "text": [
            "rain",
            "spain",
            "stays",
            "mainly",
            "plains",
            "thats",
            "youll",
            "find"
            ]
        },
        "errors": null,
        "warnings": null
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
13. Close the **Test/Run** pane and in the **wordcount** function blade, click **Get function URL**. Then copy the URL for the default key to the clipboard. You'll need this in the next unit.
