Azure enables you to create relational databases using a number of technologies, including Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for MySQL, and Azure Database for MariaDB.

Imagine that you work as a developer for a large supermarket chain called Contoso. The company has created a data store that will be used to store product inventory. The development team has used an Azure SQL database to store their data. They need to know how to query and manipulate this data using SQL.

In this module, you'll learn how to use these database services to store and retrieve data. You'll examine how to use some of the common tools available for these database management systems to connect to database services running in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> This module focuses on using Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Database for MySQL. If you are using Azure Database for MariaDB, the dialect of SQL is very similar to that used by MySQL.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Describe query techniques for data using the SQL language
* Query relational data
