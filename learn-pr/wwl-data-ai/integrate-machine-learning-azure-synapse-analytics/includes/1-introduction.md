In this lesson, the student will understand the integrated, end-to-end Azure Machine Learning, and Azure Cognitive Services experience in Azure Synapse Analytics. You will learn how to connect an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace to an Azure Machine Learning workspace using a Linked Service and then trigger an Automated ML experiment that uses data from a Spark table. You will also learn how to use trained models from Azure Machine Learning or Azure Cognitive Services to enrich data in a SQL pool table and then serve prediction results using Power BI. 

In this lesson you will learn:

* Understand Azure Machine Learning and how it relates to data science activities in Azure Synapse Analytics
* Integrate an Azure Machine Learning workspace with an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace
* Use Azure Machine Learning AutoML experiments
* Enrich data using Azure Machine Learning and Cognitive Services trained models
* Visualize prediction results using Power BI

After completing the lab, you will understand the main steps of an end-to-end Machine Learning process that build on top of the integration between Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Machine Learning.

Before taking this lesson, it is recommended that you can:

* Log into the Azure portal
* Create a Synapse Analytics Workspace
* Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace
* Create an Azure Cognitive Service resource
* Create and connect to an Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Pool
