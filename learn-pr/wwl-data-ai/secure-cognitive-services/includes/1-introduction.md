Securing Cognitive Services is necessary to avoid a bad actor gaining access to confidential data or using resources that cost you money. Cognitive Services provides multiple layers of security that you should consider when deploying the services: subscription keys, network rules, and firewall rules. In addition, policy rules can be configured to ensure that Cognitive Services follow appropriate security standards.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will walk through several key methods of enhancing security of a Cognitive Services solution.  You will:

- Secure the subscription key in Azure Key Vault.
- Configure network security to only allow access from trusted network locations.
- Manage Azure Policies to ensure resources are compliant.

## Pre-requisites

- An Azure subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account.
- Azure CLI
- TextAnalytics service
