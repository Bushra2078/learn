Cognitive Services offers multiple layers of security: subscription keys, network rules, and firewall rules. As a developer it is important to implement security from the start by keeping the subscription key secure and restricting what network locations can reach the service endpoint. You can limit access to Cognitive Services by storing the subscription key as a secret in Azure Key Vault and configuring networking restrictions. These layers of security keep bad actors from compromising your environment to use resources at your expense or access your confidential data.
