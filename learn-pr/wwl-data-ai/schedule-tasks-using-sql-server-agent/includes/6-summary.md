The SQL Server Agent provides a robust mechanism for managing and maintaining your SQL Server and Azure SQL managed instance deployments. In addition to providing job scheduling, it provides alerting and some monitoring for your databases. Maintenance plans can be used to provide backups, index and statistics maintenance, and log management activity. Note that the SQL Server Agent is only available on SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance, but not Azure SQL Database.

Now that you've reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe what maintenance activities you should perform on your databases
- Describe how to configure notifications and alerts on SQL Server Agent jobs and SQL Server
- Describe how to configure notifications alerts based on performance monitor values
