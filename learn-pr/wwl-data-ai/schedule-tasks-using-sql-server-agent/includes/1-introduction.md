Database systems need regular maintenance, which includes tasks like making backups and updating statistics. Maintenance may also include regularly scheduled jobs that execute against a database. Some common examples of these jobs would be to extract, transform, and load data from a transaction processing system into a data warehouse. In SQL Server and Azure SQL managed instance, the SQL Server Agent service allows you to schedule jobs to perform these maintenance tasks.

One of the ways you can benefit from Azure is using the built-in resource monitoring that the platform provides. You can also take advantage of the options that the Azure platform offers for handling and responding to events.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you will understand:

- What maintenance activities you should perform on your databases
- How to configure notifications and alerts on SQL Server Agent jobs and SQL Server
- How to configure notifications alerts based on performance monitor values
