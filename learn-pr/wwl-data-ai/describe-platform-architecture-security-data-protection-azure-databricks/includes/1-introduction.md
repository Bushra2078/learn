Suppose you're working for a data analytics startup that's now expanding along with its increasing customer base. You receive customer data from multiple sources and you process and save this data for reporting to both internal and external users. Due to this growth and level of access to data, security has become top priority. Your team is responsible for analyzing how to best configure security in Azure Databricks and ensure your company is maintaining compliance.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn the Azure Databricks platform architecture and how it is secured.
- Use Azure Key Vault to store secrets used by Azure Databricks and other services.
- Access Azure Storage with Key Vault-based secrets.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

There are a few Azure resources you need for the exercises in this module. If you are not using a pre-provisioned, or hosted, environment, follow the steps in this unit.
