In this module, you've learned how to integrate Azure Stream Analytics and Microsoft Power BI to generate real-time data visualizations.

By using a Power BI output in Azure Stream Analytics, you can send the results of a stream processing query to a dataset in Power BI, from which you can create real-time dashboard visualizations. You can also use the dataset to support reports that reflect the latest data when rendered.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about real-time visualization in Power BI, see [Real-time streaming in Power BI](/power-bi/connect-data/service-real-time-streaming) in the Power BI documentation.
