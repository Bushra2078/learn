Microsoft Power BI is used by organizations all around the world to create dynamic, interactive data visualizations that reveal insights on which important business decisions are based. Access to timely data can be the difference between failure and success, so the ability to capture and visualize data in real-time, or as near as possible, is critical in many scenarios.

Azure Stream Analytics provides a way to process a stream of real-time data from an input such as Azure Event Hubs, and direct the results to an output. One possible output is a Power BI dataset, from which dashboards can consume data for real-time visualization.

In this module, we'll examine how to use Azure Stream Analytics to process a stream of real-time data, and send the results to a Power BI dataset for visualization.
