quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "John is looking to train his first machine learning model. One of his inputs includes the size of the T-Shirts, with possible values of XS, S, M, L, and XL. What is the best approach John can employ to preprocess the T-Shirt size input feature?"
    choices:
    - content: "Standardization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Standardization is an approach to rescale numerical features."
    - content: "One-hot Encoding"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. One-hot Encoding is often the recommended approach to encode categorical features such as T-Shirt sizes. Whereas, Standardization and Normalization are approaches to scale numerical features."
    - content: "Normalization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Normalization is an approach to rescale numerical features."
  - content: "You have dataset with a 1000 rows and after some exploration, find out that there are some missing values. Only 5 records seem to contain no value. What is the best strategy to deal with this missing data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Duplicate the records."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Duplicating the records will result in more missing values which you want to avoid when using the data as input for machine learning tasks."
    - content: "Scale the records."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Scaling numerical features is done to change the value of the input. Not to deal with missing data."
    - content: "Drop the records."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If few records will be deleted, it is highly likely that it will not influence the accuracy of the model you will train with this dataset."
