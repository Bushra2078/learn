In this section, we are going to talk about Dynamic Data masking. 

**What is Dynamic Data Masking**:

Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics support dynamic data masking. 
It's all in the name, dynamic data masking is masking and ensures limitate data exposure to non-privileged users, such that they can't see it. 
It also helps you in preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
The way Dynamic data masking does it, is helping customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal such that it has minimal impact on the application layer. 
Dynamic Data Masking is a policy-based security feature. 
It will hide the sensitive data in a result set of a query that runs over designated database fields. However, the data in the database will not be changed.

Let's give you an example how it works. 
Let's say you work at a bank as a service representative in a call center. 
Sometime, due to compliance, the caller has to identify themselves by giving them several digits of their credit card number that they might have an issue with. 
However, these data items, should not be fully exposed to the service representative in that call center, answering the call. 
If you would define a masking rule, that masks all but the last four digits for example of that credit card number, you would get a query that only gives as a result the last four digits of the credit card number.  
If the caller, for example,  also had to provide the representative with personal information, that should not be seen by the developer that can query the production environments in order to troubleshoot, you should appropriately mask data in order to protect the given personal data such that compliance is not violated. 

For Azure Synapse Analytics, the way to set up a dynamic data masking policy is using PowerShell or the REST API. 
Bear in mind that it won't be possible for Azure Synapse Analytics to set the dynamic data masking policy in the Azure portal through selecting the Dynamic Data Masking page under Security in the SQL DB configuration pane. 
You need to set it up using PowerShell or REST API as mentioned before. 
However, the configuration of the dynamic data masking policy can be done by the Azure SQL Database admin, server admin, or SQL Security Manager roles.

In Azure Synapse Analytics, you can find Dynamic Data Masking here;

**Looking into Dynamic Data Masking Policies**:

* **SQL users are excluded from masking** 

A couple of SQL users or Azure AD identities can get unmasked data in the SQL query results. 
Users with administrator privileges are always excluded from masking, and see the original data without any mask.

* **Masking rules** - Masking rules are a set of rules that define the designated fields to be masked including the masking function that is used. The designated fields can be defined using a database schema name, table name, and column name.
* **Masking functions** - Masking functions are a set of methods that control the exposure of data for different scenarios.


**Set up dynamic data masking for your database in Azure Synapse Analytics using PowerShell cmdlets**

In this part, we are going to look into dynamic data masking for a database in Azure Synapse Analytics using PowerShell cmdlets. 

* Data masking policies

- [Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy](/powershell/module/az.sql/Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy)
The Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy gets the data masking policy for a database.
The syntax for the Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy in PowerShell is as follows:

```
Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy [-ServerName] <String> [-DatabaseName] <String>
 [-ResourceGroupName] <String> [-DefaultProfile <IAzureContextContainer>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```
What the **Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy** cmdlet does, is getting the data masking policy of an Azure SQL database.
To use this cmdlet in PowerShell, you'd have to specify the following parameters to identify the database:
* *ResourceGroupName*: name of the resource group you deployed the database in
* *ServerName*: sql server name 
* *DatabaseName* : name of the database
This cmdlet is also supported by the SQL Server Stretch Database service on Azure.


- [Set-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy](/powershell/module/az.sql/Set-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy)

The Set-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy sets data masking for a database.
The syntax for the Set-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy in PowerShell is as follows:

```
Set-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy [-PassThru] [-PrivilegedUsers <String>] [-DataMaskingState <String>]
 [-ServerName] <String> [-DatabaseName] <String> [-ResourceGroupName] <String>
 [-DefaultProfile <IAzureContextContainer>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```
What the **Set-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingPolicy** cmdlet does is setting the data masking policy for an Azure SQL database.
To use this cmdlet in PowerShell, you'd have to specify the following parameters to identify the database:
* *ResourceGroupName*: name of the resource group that you deployed the database in
* *ServerName* : sql server name 
* *DatabaseName* : name of the database

In addition, you will need to set the *DataMaskingState* parameter to specify whether data masking operations are enabled or disabled.
If the cmdlet succeeds and the *PassThru* parameter is used, it will return an object describing the current data masking policy in addition to the database identifiers.
Database identifiers can include, **ResourceGroupName**, **ServerName**, and **DatabaseName**.
This cmdlet is also supported by the SQL Server Stretch Database service on Azure.

* Data masking rules

- [Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingRule](/powershell/module/az.sql/Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingRule)

 [-DefaultProfile <IAzureContextContainer>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

What the **Get-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingRule** cmdlet does it getting either a specific data masking rule or all of the data masking rules for an Azure SQL database.
To use the cmdlet in PowerShell, you'd have to specify the following parameters to identify the database:
To use this cmdlet in PowerShell, you'd have to specify the following parameters to identify the database:
* *ResourceGroupName*: name of the resource group that you deployed the database in

* *DatabaseName* : name of the database
Providing the *TableName* and *ColumnName* is necessary in order to specify the target of the rule. 
The *MaskingFunction* parameter is necessary to define how the data is masked.
If *MaskingFunction* has a value of Number or Text, you can specify the *NumberFrom* and *NumberTo* parameters, for number masking, or the *PrefixSize*, *ReplacementString*, and *SuffixSize* for text masking.
If the command succeeds and the *PassThru* parameter is used, the cmdlet returns an object describing the data masking rule properties in addition to the rule identifiers.
Rule identifiers can be, for example, *ResourceGroupName*, *ServerName*, *DatabaseName*, and *RuleID*.
This cmdlet is also supported by the SQL Server Stretch Database service on Azure.

- [Remove-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingRule](/powershell/module/az.sql/Remove-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingRule)
The Remove-AzSqlDatabaseDataMaskingRule removes a data masking rule from a database.
