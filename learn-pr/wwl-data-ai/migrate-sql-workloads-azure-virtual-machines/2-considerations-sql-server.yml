  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "You work as a data engineer at Adventureworks who have an Enterprise Agreement that covers the SQL Servers that are currently installed on their network. You want to migrate one of your servers to a SQL Server hosted on an Azure VM. Which licensing model should you select when you provision the virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "pay-as-you-go"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. As there's already an Enterprise Agreement that covers the SQL Servers, there is a more cost-efficient way of licensing SQL Server."
    - content: "Software assurance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. As there's already an Enterprise Agreement that covers the SQL Servers, there is a more cost-efficient way of licensing SQL Server."
    - content: "bring-your-own-license"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Should your organization already have licenses in place for existing on-premises SQL Servers, and you intend to decommission those servers. The best option is to use the bring-your-own-license model."
  - content: "One of Adventureworks SQL 2008 databases has been identified as business-critical and can't experience any downtime. What is the most appropriate tool or approach to migrate the data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Migration Service (DMS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. DMS can only migrate offline data. Therefore this isn't an appropriate solution in this example."
    - content: "Transactional replication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. SQL Server transactional replication allows you to keep the source database live and replicate all the current and changed data to the SQL Server running on your Azure VM. The only downtime required is when you change your applications connections."
    - content: "Data Migration Assistant (DMA)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Using this tool involves some small downtime, there's a better choice in this example."
