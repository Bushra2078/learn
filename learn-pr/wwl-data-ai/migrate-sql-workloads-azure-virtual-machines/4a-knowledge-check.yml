  questions:
  - content: "Which SQL Server Azure licensing model lets you pay the per-second cost of running the Azure VM including the cost of the SQL Server license?"
    choices:
    - content: "Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)."

    - content: "Bring-your-own-license (BYOL)."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't a valid license option."
  - content: "What is the best way to migrate a multi-terabyte transactional database from your remote backup site with a poor internet connection?"
    choices:
    - content: "Backup and restore a database."

    - content: "Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)."

    - content: "Add failover groups in your SQL Database Managed Instance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Failover groups replicate SQL Sever databases into multiple regions to improve availability."
    - content: "Run the SQL Server Query Optimizer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. These steps won't improve database availability."
