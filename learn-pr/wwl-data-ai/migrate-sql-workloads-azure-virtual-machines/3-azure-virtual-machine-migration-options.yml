quiz:
  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "You've a SQL Server 2012 instance with a database that contains over 1.2TB of compressed data. You want to perform a backup of the database so that it can be used as part of a database migration. What type of disk volume should the backup be made to?"
    choices:
    - content: "A dynamic volume"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The maximum size of a virtual machine disk is 1 TB, so you can't use a dynamic volume."
    - content: "A striped volume"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The maximum size of a virtual machine disk is 1 TB, so a striped volume should be used to restore the data too."
    - content: "A mirrored volume"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The maximum size of a virtual machine disk is 1 TB, so you can't use a mirrored volume."
  - content: "You want to do a migration that needs to move over 50 TB of data, over a slow network connection, and downtime isn't a consideration. Which migration approach should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Attach and detach database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You could use this approach, there's a better option when the size of the databases is very large."
    - content: "Always On availability groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This answer is correct if nearly zero downtime is required, you're running on SQL Server 2014 or higher, and you have a fast network connection."
    - content: "Import and export service"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Import/Export service is specifically designed for this scenario and lets you ship hard drives to your nearest Azure data center."
