SQL Server on Azure virtual machines (VMs) lets you run full versions of SQL Server without having to manage and maintain on-premises hardware. Azure hosts a large gallery of VM images allowing you to deploy a VM quickly with the exact version, edition, and operating system you need. This Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) approach has real benefits, as well as considerations that you need to take into account when taking this migration path.

You work as a data engineer for a global bicycle retailer. Your company has a number of servers running different versions of SQL Server. Your SQL Server versions range from 2008 to 2014. The DBA team has been asked to upgrade the older SQL Servers workloads. The project is looking for ways to reduce the operating costs of its data estate, and would like your advice on the possibility of migrating your SQL Servers to run on Azure virtual machines.

In this module, you'll learn how to migrate SQL Server workloads to run on Azure VMs. You'll explore the various ways you can migrate your SQL Server workloads both offline and online. After you've migrated your workload, you'll complete some post migration tasks. These tasks will ensure that the migrated database performance hasn't been impacted.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to plan an execute a migrate from on-premises SQL Server to the Azure cloud.
