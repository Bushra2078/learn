By far, the most common model relationship is the one-to-many relationship. It fits with well with star schema design principals. Dimension tables are the “one” side, and your fact tables are the “many” side.

Once you gain mastery of model relationships and how to set them up, you’re on your way to develop more complex and efficient models. You can develop models with many-to-many relationships, and work with role-playing dimensions by activating inactive relationships.

While you add relationships at model design time, model calculations can navigate relationships, modify relationship behavior, and even create virtual relationships.
