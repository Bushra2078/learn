Many organizations are migrating their Oracle databases to Azure PostgreSQL to reduce licensing costs. Migrating to the Azure Database platform is made easier by the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS). The DMS supports both homogenous (for example, MySQL in a VM to Azure Database for MySQL) and heterogenous (for example, Oracle in a VM to Azure Database for PostgreSQL) migrations. DMS performs an initial load of your on-premises database or database running in an Azure VM to Azure Database, and then continuously syncs new database transactions to the Azure target. When you are ready to cut over to the target Azure service, you can stop the replication, and switch the connection strings in your application to the Azure Database.
