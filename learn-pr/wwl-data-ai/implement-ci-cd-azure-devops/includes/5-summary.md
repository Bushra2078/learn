Azure DevOps provides a powerful platform for data engineers and data scientists to use as a secure source code repository for their notebooks in Azure Databricks. After linking notebooks to Azure DevOps, teams can easily create build and release pipelines that allow them to implement CI/CD as part of their data and development infrastructure.

Now that you have concluded this module, you should:

- Understand CI/CD and how it applies to data engineering.
- Know how to use Azure DevOps as a source code repository for Azure Databricks notebooks.
- Know how to create build and release pipelines in Azure DevOps to automatically deploy a notebook from a development to a production Azure Databricks workspace.
