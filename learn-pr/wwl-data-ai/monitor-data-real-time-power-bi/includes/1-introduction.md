Real-time analytics allows organizations to make confident decisions based on up-to-date data. These organizations can expect to be agile and take meaningful actions based on the most current insights. Common scenarios for real-time analytics include Internet of Things (IoT) devices, factory sensors, e-commerce, inventory management, geo-tracking, financial trading, application telemetry, call centers, and others.

What’s meant by real-time is that the data is always current, and users aren’t required to interact with visualizations. Data visualizations should refresh automatically to always show current data.

> [!NOTE]
> In this module, the term real-time actually means near real-time. Near real-time means that there’s always a degree of delay (known as latency), due to data processing and network transmission time.
