In this module, you learned about using Cognitive Services containers. Containers enable a variety of deployment scenarios including on-premises. When you use containers, you have more control over the deployment. You also have more security responsibilities.

Now that you have concluded this module, you should:

- Know how to explain containerization of Cognitive Services
- Know how to create a container for reuse
- Know how to deploy a container to Azure Kubernetes Services
- Know how to secure your container
- Know how to consume from your deployed container

This module has not covered the containerization of every Cognitive Service.
