|Why |To overcome the limitations of symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems imposed on big data workloads| To take advantage of the OSS Big Data Analytics platform with SLA's in place to ensure business continuity | It provides the ability to create and manage an end-to-end big data/data science project using one platform |It provides the ability to scale efficiently with Apache Spark clusters within a one stop shop analytical platform to meet your needs.| 

The different data services on Azure that have implementations of Apache Spark as mentioned in the table are explained below:

## Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics:

Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics has Apache Spark capabilities embedded. For organizations that don’t have existing Apache Spark implementations yet, Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics provide the functionality to spin up an Apache Spark cluster to meet data engineering needs without the overhead of the other Apache Spark platforms. Data engineers, data scientist, data platform experts, and data analyst can come together within Azure Synapse Analytics where the Apache Spark cluster is running to quickly collaborate on various analytical solutions.

## Apache Spark for Azure Synapse:

Apache Spark is an open-source, memory-optimized system for managing big data workloads, which is used when you want a Spark engine for big data processing or data science, and you don’t mind that there is no service level agreement provided to keep the services running. Usually, it is of interest of open-source professionals and the reason for Apache Spark is to overcome the limitations of what was known as SMP systems for big data workloads. 

## Azure HDInsight (HDI):

HDI is an implementation by Microsoft of open-source Apache Spark, managed on the Azure Platform. You can use HDI for an Apache Spark environment when you are aware of the benefits of Apache Spark in its OSS form, but you want a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This implementation is usually of interest to open-source professionals needing an SLA and data platform experts experienced with Microsoft products and services. 

## Azure Databricks:

Azure Databricks is a managed Apache Spark-as-a-Service propriety solution that provides an end-to-end data engineering/data science platform. Azure Databricks is of interest for many data engineers and data scientists working on big data projects today. It provides the platform in which you can create and manage the big data/data science projects all on one platform.

These services are not mutually exclusive. It is common to find customers who use a combination of these technologies working together.
