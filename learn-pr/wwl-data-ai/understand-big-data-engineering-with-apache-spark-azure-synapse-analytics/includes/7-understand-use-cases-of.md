The use cases of data engineering with apache spark in Azure synapse analytics are outlined as follows:

* Data Engineering/Data Preparation:
Apache Spark includes many language features to support preparation and processing of large volumes of data so that it can be made more valuable and then consumed by other services within Synapse Analytics. It is enabled through multiple languages (C#, Scala, PySpark, Spark SQL) and supplied libraries for processing and connectivity.

* Machine Learning:
Apache Spark comes with MLlib, a machine learning library built on top of Spark that you can use from a Spark pool in Synapse Analytics. Spark pools in Synapse Analytics also include Anaconda, a Python distribution with a variety of packages for data science including machine learning. When combined with built-in support for notebooks, you have an environment for creating machine learning applications.

Also if you need computational power within a data warehousing solution and have not yet set up an Azure Databricks environment or any other environment in which you could use the capabilities of a Spark Engine, Azure Synapse Analytics is the one-stop shop to go to.
