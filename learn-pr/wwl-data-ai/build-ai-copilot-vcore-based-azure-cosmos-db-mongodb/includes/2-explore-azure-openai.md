The Azure OpenAI Service offers REST API access to advanced language models such as GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and the Embeddings series. These models are flexible, supporting tasks like content generation, summarization, and image understanding. You can access the models through REST APIs, Python SDK, Node.js SDK, or directly via the Azure OpenAI Studio. 

These methods provide powerful tools for enhancing applications with complex language and image processing functions, integrating OpenAI’s advanced language models with the secure and robust environment of Azure. The Azure OpenAI Service supports a range of AI-driven tasks like natural language processing, image recognition, and more. You can access Azure OpenAI through user-friendly access points such as REST APIs, Python SDK, and Azure OpenAI Studio.

## Utilize models and enhance security

Azure OpenAI provides several models, including the versatile GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo series. These models can be extended for specific tasks, such as the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision which is tailored for visual data interpretation. Security features like virtual network support and managed identities ensure safe data handling, making model management secure and straightforward.

## Access control and ethical AI use

Access to Azure OpenAI is limited to ensure adherence to Microsoft’s standards for responsible AI. This limited access policy supports maintaining ethical AI use across applications. Interactions with the models require prompt input, which returns text completions, demonstrating the service’s practical use in real-world applications.

Familiarizing yourself with these features allows you to effectively implement Azure OpenAI to enhance your applications, ensuring they're both powerful and in line with ethical AI practices.

## Implement practical applications and vector search

Setting up Azure OpenAI involves creating an Azure resource and deploying models that meet strict security and compliance standards. This setup allows businesses to use advanced AI technologies while keeping their operations scalable, secure, and compliant. Incorporating Azure OpenAI for embedding-based vector search RAG (Retrieval Augmentation Generation) systems enhances search capabilities significantly. When combined with your own data in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, it provides powerful language comprehension and generation, adapting responses based on the retrieved data.

Using the Azure OpenAI service in your applications allows you to tap into advanced AI features. Azure OpenAI boosts efficiency and flexibility in your business operations, all while adhering to principles of responsible AI usage.
