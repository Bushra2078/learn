In a database, a transaction is typically defined as a sequence of point operations grouped together into a single unit of work. It's expected that a transaction provides **ACID** guarantees:

- **Atomicity** guarantees that all the work done inside a transaction is treated as a single unit where either all of it is committed or none.
- **Consistency** makes sure that the data is always in a healthy internal state across transactions.
- **Isolation** guarantees that no two transactions interfere with each other â€“ generally, most commercial systems provide multiple isolation levels that can be used based on the application's needs.
- **Durability** ensures that any change that's committed in the database will always be present.

In Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, a stored procedure executes one or more operations as a single unit of work within the same scope. Stored procedures are registered in containers, and run within the scope of that specific container.
> [!NOTE]
> Stored procedures are scoped to a single logical partition. You cannot execute a stored procedure that performs operations across logical partition key values.

Transactions occurs server-side in Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, so they must adhere to the same limitations as many other HTTP requests. All operations within a stored procedure must completed within a bounded amount of time. Specifically, the operations must be complete with the **server request timeout** duration.

For long-running lists of operations, a helper boolean value is returned by any JavaScript function that performs an operation indicating whether that operation is expected to complete within the request timeout duration. If the Boolean is **true**, you can continue on with the stored procedure. Once that Boolean is **false**, then the stored procedure must finalize as soon as possible. At this point, it is common to return a pointer so that subsequent calls to the stored procedure can start from the pointer instead of rewinding progress all the way to the beginning of the long-running list of operations.
