The ability to include real-time data ingestion in an analytics solution enables organizations to build reports and interactive data models that reflect the most up-to-date information available. Azure Synapse Analytics offers a wide range of analytical capabilities that you can use with both streaming and batch data to create highly scalable solutions for massive volumes of data.
