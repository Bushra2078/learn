Suppose you want to build an application that can provide dynamic suggestions for users. You have heard of ChatGPT, an application which takes in natural language input from a user and returns a machine-created human-like response. You learn that generative AI on the back end of ChatGPT powers its ability to produce new content, such as text, code, and images, based on a natural language prompts. Next, you would like to try combining existing Azure AI capabilities with Azure's generative AI capabilities.  

Azure OpenAI Service models are a collection of generative AI models available for building applications through a REST API, various SDKs, and a Studio interface. This module will guide you through the Azure OpenAI Studio experience, giving you the hands-on background to further develop solutions with generative AI.
