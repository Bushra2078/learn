Suppose you want to build a support application which will summarize text and suggest code. You would like to utilize the capabilities you see in ChatGPT, a chatbot built by the OpenAI research company, that takes in natural language input from a user and returns a machine-created human-like response. 

On the back end of ChatGPT, generative AI models power its ability to produce new content, such as text, code, and images, based on a natural language prompts. Generative AI models are a subset of [deep learning algorithms](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/deep-learning-overview?portal=true) which can support a variety of workloads across vision, speech, language, decision, search, and more.

Azure OpenAI Service brings the generative AI models to the Azure platform, enabling you to develop powerful AI solutions that benefit from the security, scalability, and integration of other services provided by the Azure cloud platform. These models are available for building applications through a REST API, various SDKs, and a Studio interface. This module will guide you through the Azure OpenAI Studio experience, giving you the foundation to further develop solutions with generative AI.
