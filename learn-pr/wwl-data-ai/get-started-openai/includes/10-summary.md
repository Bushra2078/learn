This module covered the basics of getting started with Azure OpenAI Service with a focus on using the Azure OpenAI Studio. 

You learned how to:
- Create an Azure OpenAI Service resource and understand types of Azure OpenAI base models.
- Use the Azure OpenAI Studio, console, or REST API to deploy a base model and test it in the Studio playground.
- Generate completions to prompts and begin to manage model parameters.

One way to learn more is by exploring the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai?azure-portal=true).
