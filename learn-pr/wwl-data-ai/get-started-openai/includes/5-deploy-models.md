Whether you use the Azure OpenAI Studio interface or REST API to start, you first need to deploy a model to make API calls to receive completions to prompts. 

## Deploy using Azure OpenAI Studio 
In Azure OpenAI Studio, you can navigate from the home page to deployments in the **Manage your deployments and models** section and by selecting **Go to deployments**.

From the deployments page, you are able to create a new deployment by selecting a model from the menu. The available base models are based on the list in the models page.

Once the model is deployed, you can test it in the playground.
