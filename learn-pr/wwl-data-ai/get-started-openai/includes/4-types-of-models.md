To begin building with Azure OpenAI, you need to choose a base model and deploy it. Microsoft provides base models and the option to create customized base models. This module will cover the currently available out-of-the-box base models. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI means models that become availible with OpenAI can become available with Azure OpenAI.   

Azure OpenAI's models are grouped by family and capability. 

|Family|Models within Family|Description|
|GPT|--|--|
|Codex|--|--|
|Embeddings|--|--|

The models within the family differ in capability.  

In the Azure OpenAI Studio, you can navigate to the models by creating a new deployment.
