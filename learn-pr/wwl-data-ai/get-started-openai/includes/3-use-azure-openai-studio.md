Azure OpenAI Studio provides access to model management, deployment, experimentation, customization, and learning resources. 

You can access the Azure OpenAI Studio  through the Azure portal after creating a resource, or at [https://oai.azure.com](https://oai.azure.com/?azure-portal=true) by logging in with your Azure OpenAI resource instance. During the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

Once you're in the Azure OpenAI Studio, you'll see a call-to-action button at the top of the screen. If you don't have any deployments yet, the button reads **Create new deployment**. Get started by selecting the button, which brings you to the **Deployments** page. Deployments is one of several navigation options that appears on the left-hand side of the screen.

Once in the studio, your next steps include:

1. Choosing a base model.
1. Deploying a base model.
1. Testing the model. An easy way to do this is in one of the studio playgrounds.
1. Experimenting with prompts and parameters to see their effect on completions, or the generated output.
