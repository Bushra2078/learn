[Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/?portal=true) provides access to model management, deployment, experimentation, customization, and learning resources. You can access the Studio by logging in with your Azure OpenAI resource instance. During the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

Once in the studio, your next steps include: 
1. Choosing a base model and deploying it. 
1. Testing the model. An easy way to do this is in the studio playground. 
1. Experimenting with prompts and parameters to see their effect on completions, or the generated output.
1. Exploring ways to fine-tune and customize your model.

Next you will learn about the types of models and their capabilities.
