There are two cognitive services that you can use to build solutions that detect faces in images.

![The Computer Vision and Face services offer facial analysis capabilities](../media/face-options.png)

## The Computer Vision service

The **Computer Vision** service enables you to detect human faces in an image, returning a bounding box for its location. It also returns some facial feature information about the detected face; specifically, predictions for:
- Gender
- Age

## The Face service

The **Face** service offers more comprehensive facial analysis capabilities than the Computer Vision service, including:
- Face detection (with bounding box).
- Comprehensive facial feature analysis (including age, gender, emotional state, head pose, hair color, presence of facial hair, presence of spectacles, and others).
- Face comparison and verification.
- Facial recognition.
