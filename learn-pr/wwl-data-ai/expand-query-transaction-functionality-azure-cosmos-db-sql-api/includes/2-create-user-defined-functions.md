User-defined functions (UDFs) are used to extend the Azure Cosmos DB SQL APIâ€™s query language grammar and implement custom business logic. UDFs can only be called from inside queries as they enhance and extend the SQL query language.

> [!NOTE]
> UDFs do not have access to the context object and are meant to be used as compute-only code

Here is an example JSON document for a product with a **name** and a **price** property.

```javascript
{
  "name": "Black Bib Shorts (Small)",
  "price": 80.00
}
```

A simple SQL query to get the data from a container with many items like this one, would be constructed to include both fields.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.name,
    p.price
FROM
    products p
```

UDFs extend the SQL query language by giving you small areas where you can inject simple business logic into a query. Let's take this example, and create a user-defined function to apply business tax. In our example scenario, we want to apply a 15% tax and end up with an ideal result set that includes a third **priceWithTax** property.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Black Bib Shorts (Small)",
    "price": 80.00,
    "priceWithTax": 92.00
  }
]
```

A user-defined function is defined as a JavaScript function that takes in one or more scalar input\[s\] and then returns a scalar value as the output.

```javascript
function name(input) {
    return output;
}
```

In this example function, the scalar input is assumed to be a number that is then multipled by **1.15** to add 15% tax.

```javascript
function addTax(preTax) {
    return preTax * 1.15;
}
```

The updated query includes a third projected field that references the udf function by using the ``udf.addTax()`` syntax passing in the **p.price** field as an input parameter and aliasing the output of that field to the name **priceWithTax**.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.name,
    p.price,
    udf.addTax(p.price) AS priceWithTax
FROM
    products p
```
