  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What language are Azure Resource Manager templates written in?"
    choices:
    - content: "JSON"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. An Azure Resource Manager template is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) document that describes the resources that will be deployed within an Azure Resource Group."
    - content: "C#"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While templates can be called by C# programs it is not their native format."
    - content: "T-SQL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Templates do not support T-SQL."
  - content: "If you want to specify the region for a resource group deployment which option should you include in your template?"
    choices:
    - content: "Parameter"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Parameters are values that are provided to the template in order to customize resources at deployment time."
    - content: "Variable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Variables are values that are used as JSON fragments to simplify template language expressions."
    - content: "Output"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Output passes information back to downstream processes."
  - content: "Which element of a template allows for you to build dependencies into resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "dependsOn"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. DependsOn allows you to build a dependency structure into your template."
    - content: "concat"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Concat simply concatenates values."
    - content: "apiVersion"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. ApiVersion specifics the version of the API to deploy a resource, but not dependencies."
