You've been hired as a Senior Data Engineer to help automate day to day operations of database administration. This automation is to help ensure that the databases for AdventureWorks continue to operate at peak performance and provide methods for alerting based on certain criteria.

1. On the GitHub webpage, scroll down select **Deploy to Azure**. You may be prompted to sign in to the Azure portal.

1. The username and password information to sign into the Azure portal are in the  **Resources** tab above these instructions. If you select the **Username** it will be filled in for you.
