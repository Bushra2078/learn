On-premises systems require cabling and racks of hardware in order to deploy a new database server. With cloud computing, this isn't necessary. One of the major benefits of cloud computing is that system resources are abstracted behind an API. 

A common term used around cloud computing deployments is *infrastructure as code*, which means all of your resources are defined a set of scripts that are stored in source control and can easily be deployed to a new environment. Although stateful resources don't need to be deployed as frequently as application code, by defining your infrastructure, you ensure that resources are implemented consistently, reducing configuration risk and human error.
