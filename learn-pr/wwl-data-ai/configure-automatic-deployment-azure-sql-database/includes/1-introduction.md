On-premises systems require cabling and racks of hardware in order to deploy a new database server. With cloud computing, this is not necessary. One of the major benefits of cloud computing is that system resources are abstracted behind an API. For Azure, this deployment and management layer is called Azure Resource Manager. Azure Resource Manager offers a consistent deployment mechanism called Resource Manager templates, which are JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents that can be used for parameterized deployment.
