abstract: |
  After completing this module, you will be able to:
  - Provision Azure resources for Custom Vision
  - Understand object detection
  - Train an object detector
  - Consider options for labeling images
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should already have:
  - Familiarity with Azure and the Azure portal.
  - Experience programming with C# or Python.
  If you have no previous programming experience, we recommend you complete the [Take your first steps with C#](/learn/paths/csharp-first-steps/) or [Take your first steps with Python](/learn/paths/python-first-steps/) learning path first.
