Azure Databricks is a Cloud-Optimized, managed Big Data analytics PaaS offering. As such, it is designed to hide the underlying distributed systems and networking complexity as much as possible from the end user. It is backed by a team of support staff who monitor its health, debug tickets filed via Azure, etc. This allows ADB users to focus on developing value generating apps rather than stressing over infrastructure management. However, there are many options at your disposal for configuring an Azure Databricks environment. Learning best practices for configuring and using Azure Databricks helps you take full advantage of its powerful capabilities.
