  questions:
  - content: "What is SCIM?"
    choices:
    - content: "An optimization that removes orphaned data from a given dataset"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SCIM stands for \"System for Cross-domain Identity Management\"."
    - content: "An open standard that enables users to bring their own auth key to the Databricks environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While SCIM is an open standard, it does not allow users to bring their own keys."
    - content: "An open standard that enables organizations to import both groups and users from Azure Active Directory into Azure Databricks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By default, Azure Active Directory roles have no relationship with groups created inside of Azure Databricks. SCIM enables synchronizing users and groups, and synchronization is automatic after initial import."
  - content: "If mounting an Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) account to a workspace, what cluster feature must be used to have ACLS within ADLS applied to the user executing commands in a notebook?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable ADLS Passthrough on a cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When enabled, authentication automatically takes place in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) from Azure Databricks clusters using the same Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identity that one uses to log into Azure Databricks. Any ACLs applied at the folder or file level in ADLS are enforced based on the user's identity."
    - content: "Enable SCIM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SCIM enables account and group synchronization from Azure Active Directory to Azure Databricks. It does not pass an Azure Active Directory user identity to ADLS."
    - content: "Set spark.config.adls.impersonateuser(true)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no such command."
