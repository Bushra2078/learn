In Azure Machine Learning, data scientists can run *experiments* based on scripts that process data, train machine learning models, and perform other data science tasks. The runtime context for each experiment run consists of two elements:

- The *environment* for the script, which includes all packages on which the script depends.
- The *compute target* on which the environment will be deployed and the script run.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Create and use environments.
- Create and use compute targets.
