  questions:
  - content: "You're using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK to run experiments. You need to create an environment from a Conda configuration (.yml) file. Which method of the Environment class should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "create"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Use the create_from_conda_specification method to create an environment from a configuration file. The create method requires you to explicitly specify conda and pip packages, and the create_from_existing_conda_environment requires an existing environment on the computer."
    - content: "create_from_conda_specification"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Use the create_from_conda_specification method to create an environment from a configuration file. The create method requires you to explicitly specify conda and pip packages, and the create_from_existing_conda_environment requires an existing environment on the computer."
    - content: "create_from_existing_conda_environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Use the create_from_conda_specification method to create an environment from a configuration file. The create method requires you to explicitly specify conda and pip packages, and the create_from_existing_conda_environment requires an existing environment on the computer."
  - content: "You must create a compute target for training experiments that require a graphical processing unit (GPU). You want to be able to scale the compute so that multiple nodes are started automatically as required. Which kind of compute target should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Compute Instance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Use a training cluster to create multiple nodes of GPU-enabled VMs that are started automatically as needed."
    - content: "Compute Cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Use a compute cluster to create multiple nodes of GPU-enabled VMs that are started automatically as needed."
    - content: "Inference Cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Use a training cluster to create multiple nodes of GPU-enabled VMs that are started automatically as needed."
