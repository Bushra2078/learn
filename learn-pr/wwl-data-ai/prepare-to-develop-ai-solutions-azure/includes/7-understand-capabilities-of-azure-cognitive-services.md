**Azure Cognitive Services** are cloud-based services that encapsulate AI capabilities. Rather than a single product, you should think of Azure Cognitive Services as a set of individual services that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications.

Cognitive services offer a wide range of prebuilt AI capabilities across multiple categories, as shown in the following table.

| Language | Speech | Vision | Decision |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Text Analytics | Speech to Text | Computer Vision |  Anomaly Detector |
| Translator | Text to Speech | Custom Vision | Content Moderator |
| QnA Maker | Speech Translation | Face API | Personalizer |
| Language Understanding | Speaker Recognition |  | |
| | | | |

We will explore many of these cognitive services in the remainder of this course.
