Data analysts and engineers often find themselves forced to choose between the flexibility of storing data files in a data lake, with the advantages of a structured schema in a relational database. *Lake databases* in Azure Synapse Analytics provide a way to combine these two approaches and benefit from an explicit relational schema of tables, views, and relationships that is decoupled from file-based storage.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Understand lake database concepts and components
- Describe database templates in Azure Synapse Analytics
- Create a lake database

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have the following prerequisite skills and knowledge:

- Familiarity with the Microsoft Azure portal
