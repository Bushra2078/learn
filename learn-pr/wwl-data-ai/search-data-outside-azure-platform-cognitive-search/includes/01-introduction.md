Azure Cognitive Search supports two main ways to get data into a search index. So far, you've seen how to *pull* data using indexers. The most flexible way to get data into an index is to *push* the data into it.

In this module, you'll see how to push data into an index using the built-in Azure Search linked service in Azure Data Factory. However, this approach has its limitations. So you'll also explore how to use the Azure Cognitive Search Push API to push data into an index using .NET CORE. The exercise will show you optimizations you can make using the Push API to improve data ingestion.
