In your video camera manufacturer, the on-premises Cassandra database that you were using to host metadata for your video sharing web application was not keeping pace with the demand from users. Its location in Europe was not serving customers in other continents well. By migrating the database into Azure, you have created an infrastructure that is cost-effective but also can be rapidly scaled to keep pace with demand as your company grows.

Its possible to host Cassandra in Azure virtual machines, in which case you must take responsibility for updating the operating system, database server, and other software, as well as configuring availability and resilience to failures. By choosing Azure Cosmos DB to host your Cassandra database, you receive the benefits of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) system, so Azure updates software automatically and takes care of availability and resilience within its Service Level Agreement (SLA). You can devote your time to improving your product for customers.
