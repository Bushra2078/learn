The Cassandra API for Azure Cosmos DB offers many benefits over an on-premises deployment of Cassandra. For example, companies can use it to reduce costs while achieving greater availability and scalability.

Suppose you work for a manufacturer of small, quality video cameras. You have a web application that allows users to share their videos with the community. The application stores metadata for videos in a Cassandra database, which you run in an on-premises data center in your European headquarters. Customers in North America, Africa, and Asia are complaining of slow response from this application and you are not achieving 99.9% uptime. You expect rapid growth in the next two years and its vital that capacity can grow in step. You want to investigate how to host your Cassandra database in the cloud.

This module discusses the benefits of migration and the choices to make, and steps to take, when performing a migration as well as post-migration steps to optimize your system.

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to host Cassandra databases in Azure and how to migrate them into the cloud.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- List the benefits of migrating a Cassandra database to Azure Cosmos DB.
- Plan a Cassandra to Cosmos DB migration.
- Explain the steps to perform a migration.
- List the post migration steps to connect your application and optimize your database.
