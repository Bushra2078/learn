In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **08-Train-a-ML-model** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2. Exercise Featurization** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

In this exercise you are going featurize categorical data by dividing it into bins. You will also remove records with incorrect data values, and standardize the label column.

> [!Note]
> You will find a corresponding notebook within the `Solutions` subfolder. This contains completed cells for the exercise. Refer to the notebook if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
