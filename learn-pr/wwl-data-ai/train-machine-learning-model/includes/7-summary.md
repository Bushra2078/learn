In this module, you learned how to use PySpark's machine learning package to build featurization pipelines, train and interpret a simple regression model, and train a multivariate regression model.

Now that you have concluded this module, you should know:

1. Differentiate Spark transformers, estimators, and pipelines
1. One-hot encode categorical features
1. Impute missing data
1. Combine different featurization stages into a pipeline
1. Train a simple regression model
1. Interpret regression models
1. Train a multivariate regression model

## Cleanup

If you plan to complete other Azure Databricks modules, don't delete your Azure Databricks instance yet. You can use the same environment for the other modules.

### Delete the Azure Databricks instance

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. In the left pane, select **Resource groups**, and then find the resource group that contains your Azure Databricks instance.
1. Select the resource group, and either right-click the row or use the **ellipsis** (**...**) button to open the context menu.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter the name of the resource group, and then select **Delete**.
