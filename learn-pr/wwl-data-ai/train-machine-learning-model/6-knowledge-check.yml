  questions:
  - content: "One of inputs to a machine learning model is the size of the T-Shirts, with possible values of XS, S, M, L, and XL. What is the approach to featurize the T-Shirt size input feature?"
    choices:
    - content: "Standardization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Standardization technique is used for numeric data types."
    - content: "Normalization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Normalization technique is used for numeric data types."
    - content: "One Hot Encoding"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, One Hot Encoding is a common approach to featurize categorical data types."
  - content: "Which of these best summarizes the difference between regression and classification?"
    choices:
    - content: "Regression predicts a binary outcome."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The output of regression is the prediction of a numeric outcome."
    - content: "Regression predicts numeric outcomes and classification predicts labels."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the best description."
    - content: "Classification predicts a binary label."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Classification algorithms can predict binary labels but can also be used to predict multiple labels."
  - content: "In regression models, p-value is used to asses if the model coefficients are statistically significant. What is the best interpretation of p-value < 0.05 between the input feature and the predicted output?"
    choices:
    - content: "There is more than 95% chance of seeing the correlation between input and output by mere chance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect interpretation of p-value < 0.05."
    - content: "There is less than 5% chance of seeing the correlation between input and output by mere chance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct interpretation of p-value < 0.05."
    - content: "The p-value measures the amount of variability in the output that can be attributed to the model coefficients and the input."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "R-squared is the measure of variability in the output attributed to the model coefficients and the input."
