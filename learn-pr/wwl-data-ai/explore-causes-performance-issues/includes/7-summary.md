The Query Store helps you quickly identify your most expensive queries, and find any changes in performance. By automating the collection of query plan and execution runtime, the Query Store provides a powerful complete data collection. SQL Server and Azure SQL provide locking and blocking in order to manage concurrency and ensure data consistency. You can adjust the isolation levels in SQL Server to help manage concurrency. Finally, fragmentation can occur in indexes over time as inserts and deletes happen. 

Now that you've reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the purpose and benefits of the Query Store
- Investigate the available reports and data in the Query Store
- See the impact of forcing execution plan selection
- Understand how blocking and locking work in the SQL Server database engine
- Understand about database isolation levels
- Have an understanding of database fragmentation and its impact
