Fragmentation on storage occurs when a collection of data that should be stored together is broken up into many pieces that are not contiguous on disk. Historically, non-contiguous data was problematic on systems with hard disk drives, which performed much better when executing sequential reads and writes (reading or writing a set of data in contiguous sectors on the disk). Modern solid-state devices (SSDs) reduce the impact of fragmentation, at least at the operating system level, but it can still be impactful within the data files used by SQL Server.

Fragmentation occurs when indexes (both clustered and nonclustered) have pages in which the logical ordering of the index, which is based on the data value of the index key, does not match the physical ordering of the pages. Fragmentation occurs when the engine modifies pages when performing insert or update operations. If there is no longer space on an existing page for the new value, the page will split. Split pages can degrade performance, particularly for scan operations, because additional I/O is required to retrieve the data. Fragmentation can be reduced by using the fillfactor setting when creating an index. A low fillfactor value leaves free space on the pages for inserted and updated rows.
