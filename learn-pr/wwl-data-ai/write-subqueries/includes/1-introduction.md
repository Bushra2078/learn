Sometimes, when using Transact-SQL to retrieve data from a database, it can be easier to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into multiple simpler queries that can be combined to achieve the desired results.

Transact-SQL supports the creation of *subqueries*, in which an inner query returns its result to an outer query.

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Understand what subqueries are 
- Use scalar or multi-valued subqueries
- Use self-contained or correlated subqueries
