In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **10-Hyperparameter-Tuning** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2. Exercise Model Selection** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

In this exercise, you will use grid search and cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters from a logistic regression model.

> [!NOTE]
> You will find a corresponding notebook within the `Solutions` subfolder. This contains completed cells for the exercise. Refer to the notebook if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
