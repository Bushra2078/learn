Understanding execution plans and how indexes are used are the fundamentals of database performance. At the same time, you need to understand patterns and anti-patterns for relational databases and aim for good query choices and proper indexing. Query Store acts as a data recorder for the database engine, and it is focused on query performance and changes in execution plans.

Now that you've reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Compare the different types of execution plans
- Understand the purpose and benefits of the Query Store
- Investigate the available reports and data in the Query Store
- Understand how blocking and locking work in the SQL Server database engine
