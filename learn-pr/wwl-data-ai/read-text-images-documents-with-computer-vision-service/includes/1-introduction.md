Suppose you are given thousands of images and asked to transfer the text on the images to a computer database. The scanned images have text organized in different formats and contain multiple languages. What are some ways you could complete the project in a reasonable time frame and make sure the data is entered with a high degree of accuracy? 

Companies around the world are tackling similar scenarios every day. Without AI services, it would be challenging to complete the project, especially if it were to change in scale.

Using AI services, we can treat this project as a computer vision scenario and apply Optical character recognition (OCR). OCR allows you to extract text from images, such as photos of street signs and products, as well as from documentsâ€”invoices, bills, financial reports, articles, and more. In this module, you'll explore cognitive services that can be used to detect and read text from images. 

To build an automated AI solution, you need machine learning models trained to cover each use case. Azure's Computer Vision service gives access to advanced algorithms for processing images and returning information to secure data storage. 

In this module, you'll learn how to: 

- Identify how the Computer Vision service enables you to read text from images with the OCR API and Read API
- Use the Computer Vision service with SDKs and the REST API
- Develop an application that can read handwritten text
