quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which API would be best for reading a large amount of text, handwritten in English, printed in multiple languages, with high accuracy?"
    choices:
    - content: "OCR API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: While the OCR API also detects regions of printed text from an image file, it is an older model that is not best suited for large amounts of text"
    - content: "Read API"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct : The OCR API cannot process handwritten English and is not suitable for large amounts of text."
    - content: "Image Analysis API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Image Analysis service is a computer vision service, but it extracts visual features from images, such as objects, faces, and adult content."
  - content: "What is a difference between the response returned from a call to the Read API versus the OCR API?"
    choices:
    - content: "There is no difference between the response returned, the only difference is that the Read API can be used for handwritten text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect : There is a difference in the way the results are broken down."
    - content: "The OCR API results are broken down by *region*, *line*, then *word*, while the Read API results are broken down by *page*, then *line*, and then *word*."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Yes, the OCR API results are broken down by *region* and the Read API results are borken down by *page*."
    - content: "The OCR API results include bounding box coordinates for images as well as text, while the Read API results only include results for text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect : The OCR API results do not include bounding box coordinates for images."
  - content: "You have scanned a letter into PDF format and need to extract the text it contains. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Custom Vision service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect : The Custom Vision service is used to build and deploy image identification by applying labels to classes or objects."
    - content: "Use the OCR API of the Computer Vision service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect : The OCR API cannot be used to process PDF formatted files."
    - content: "Use the Read API of the Computer Vision service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The Read API can be used to process PDF formatted files."
