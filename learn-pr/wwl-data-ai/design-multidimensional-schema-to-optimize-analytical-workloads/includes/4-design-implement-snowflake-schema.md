A **snowflake schema** is a set of normalized tables for a single business entity. For example, Adventure Works classifies products by category and subcategory. Categories are assigned to subcategories, and products are in turn assigned to subcategories. In the Adventure Works relational data warehouse, the product dimension is normalized and stored in three related tables: `DimProductCategory`, `DimProductSubcategory`, and `DimProduct`.

The snowflake schema is a variation of the star schema. You add normalized dimension tables to a star schema to create a snowflake pattern. In the following diagram, you see the yellow dimension tables surrounding the blue fact table. Notice that many of the dimension tables relate to one another in order to normalize the business entities:
