Relational data warehouses are at the center of most enterprise business intelligence (BI) solutions. While the specific details may vary across data warehouse implementations, a common pattern based on a denormalized, multidimensional schema has emerged as the standard design for a relational data warehouse.

Azure Synapse Analytics includes a highly scalable relational database engine that is optimized for data warehousing workloads. By using *dedicated SQL pools* in Azure Synapse Analytics, you can create databases that are capable of hosting and querying huge volumes of data in relational tables.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Design a schema for a relational data warehouse.
- Create fact, dimension, and staging tables.
- Use SQL to load data into data warehouse tables.
- Use SQL to query relational data warehouse tables.
