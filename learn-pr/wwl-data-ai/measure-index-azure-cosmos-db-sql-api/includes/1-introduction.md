As you evaluate your indexing policy, it makes sense to track both the indexâ€™s metrics and the number of RU/s charged per query or operation. In this module, you will use request option classes in the .NET SDK to track metadata about your queries and operations.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Tune an indexing policy for specific queries
- Measure the cost for a query or operation
