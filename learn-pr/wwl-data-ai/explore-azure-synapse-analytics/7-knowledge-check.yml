quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which component of an Azure Data Factory can be triggered to run data ingestion tasks?"
    choices:
    - content: "CSV File"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Even though a CSV file can be imported or exported, it cannot be run without an orchestration framework."
    - content: "Pipeline"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Pipelines can be triggered to run activities for ingesting data."
    - content: "Linked service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A linked service specifies the connection parameters for connecting to an Azure service. It's not a task that can be run."
  - content: "When might PolyBase be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "To query data from external data sources from Azure Synapse Analytics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This is the purpose of PolyBase"
    - content: "To ingest streaming data using Azure Databricks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. PolyBase is a data virtualization feature for SQL Server and doesn't extend support to Databricks."
    - content: "To orchestrate activities in Azure Data Factory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Data Factory pipelines are used to orchestrate activities."
  - content: "Which of these services can be used to ingest data into Azure Synapse Analytics?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Factory"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Data Factory can be used to ingest data into Azure Synapse Analytics from almost any source."
    - content: "Power BI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Power BI is an analytics tool that can be used to report on the data within Azure Synapse Analytics."
    - content: "Azure Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Active Directory is an authentication mechanism, not a data ingestion framework."
  - content: "There is a large amount of data held in files in Azure Data Lake storage. Someone wants to retrieve the data in these files and use it to populate tables held in Azure Synapse Analytics. Which processing option is most appropriate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure Synapse Link to connect to Azure Data Lake storage and download the data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Synapse Link enables someone to connect to Azure Cosmos DB, not Data Lake storage."
    - content: "Synapse SQL pool"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. PolyBase can be used from a SQL pool to connect to the files in Azure Data Lake as external tables, and then ingest the data."
    - content: "Synapse Spark pool"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A Spark notebook can be used to extract the data from Data Lake storage, but it is not the optimal solution for this scenario."
  - content: "In Azure Databricks how does someone change the language a cell uses?"
    choices:
    - content: "The first line in the cell is %language. For example, %scala."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Each cell can start with a language definition."
    - content: "Change the notebook language before writing the commands."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The default language used can be controlled in all the cells by setting the default. This doesn't allow someone to change the language for each cell."
    - content: "Wrap the command in the cell with ##language##."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't the correct syntax."
