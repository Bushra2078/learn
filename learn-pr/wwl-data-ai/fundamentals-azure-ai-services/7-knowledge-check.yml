  questions:
  - content: "You work for a wildlife sanctuary and are considering using AI to identify bird species from images. Which AI service should you use to prototype your idea?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure AI Vision"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AI Vision allows you to add images to the existing model to improve the image identifier model. This is a good choice for identifying the small differences between bird species."
    - content: "Azure AI Cognitive Search"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AI Cognitive Search includes data extraction and indexing capabilities for knowledge mining. Another Azure AI service should be used to identify individual bird species."
    - content: "Azure OpenAI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure OpenAI helps organizations generate content and insights. Another Azure AI service should be used to identify bird species from images."
  - content: "Your application requires three separate AI services, and you want to see the cost for each separately. What type of resource(s) should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "A multi-service resource that includes all the AI services that you require"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A multi-service resource that includes all the AI services that you require will not enable you to see the costs separately for each service."
    - content: "A single-service resource for each AI service that you require"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Create a single-service resource for each AI service that you require. This will enable you to see costs separately for each resource."
    - content: "It is not possible to see costs separately for individual AI services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It is possible to see costs separately for each AI service resource you create."
  - content: "You get an error message when trying to explore the capabilities of the translator service in the Language studio. What could be the problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Language studio hasnâ€™t been authenticated"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It is not necessary to authenticate the Language studio."
    - content: "You must first train the model in your chosen language"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You do not need to train the model in your chosen language. The translator AI service includes a pre-trained model."
    - content: "You haven't associated the resource with the studio"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To explore the capabilities of the translator service in the Language studio, you must first associate the resource with the studio."
  - content: "What is an Azure AI services resource?"
    choices:
    - content: "A bundle of several AI services in one resource"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An AI services resource is a bundle of several AI services in one resource."
