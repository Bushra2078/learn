If you have an on-premises database that runs on MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL, and you want to migrate to the cloud, Azure provides several services that can host those databases and help you to realize all the scaling, availability, and cost advantages of cloud computing.

Suppose you work at a start-up technology company that has recently been created to market a new product developed in a university. You have several databases that were implemented on both MySQL and PostgreSQL that support your Computer Aided Design (CAD) and supplier communications systems. You have ambitious targets for rapid growth and you want to ensure that the databases can scale up quickly when needed. You also want to set up offices around the globe in the first year or two of trading. You've decided to migrate the databases to the cloud to support these requirements. You want to know what technologies are available in Azure to host these databases and you want to plan your migration.

In this module, you'll learn about the issues and considerations for migrating on-premises open-source databases to Azure. You'll be introduced to the services that Azure provides to help you migrate and host your databases. You'll look at what you need to consider when planning a migration project, and you'll learn about different approaches to migrating databases.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to migrate an on-premises database on an open-source platform to Azure.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the features and services available in Azure for hosting an open-source database.
- Explain the key considerations for implementing a migration project.  
- Describe different approaches that you can take for migrating databases.
