Now that you have completed this module, you understand the benefits of using windows and window functions. You have learned how to use the OVER clause to restrict the rows that a window function works on, including partitions and frames. You have also learned how to write queries that use window functions that return ranking, aggregation, and offset comparison results.

Now that you have completed this module, you can:

- Describe the benefits of window functions.
- Use the OVER clause.
- Use RANK, AGGREGATE, and OFFSET functions.
