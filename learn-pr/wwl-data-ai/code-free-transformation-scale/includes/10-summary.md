The Mapping Data Flow makes it even easier for more people to create code free transformation that can be used to cleanse data. With common transformation types covered, it may be the only tool required before loading into a data warehouse or preparing for an advanced analytical workload. If not, Azure Data Factory also can call on the features of a variety of Azure Data Platform technologies to perform transformations on its behalf. For organizations that have SSIS packages that contain the transformation logic, SSIS packages can be used with Azure Data Factory too, which make Azure Data Factory the one stop shop for your transformation needs.
