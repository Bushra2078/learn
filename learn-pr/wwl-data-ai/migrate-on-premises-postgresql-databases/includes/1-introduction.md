In this module, you'll learn about the benefits of migrating PostgreSQL workloads to Azure, and the features that Azure provides to help manage and optimize PostgreSQL systems. You'll see how to create an instance of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL service, and then you'll learn how to migrate on-premises PostgreSQL databases to Azure. You'll also see how to reconfigure an application that uses the database to connect to Azure instead.

## Learning objectives  

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the features and limitations of Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Migrate an on-premises PostgreSQL database to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Reconfigure existing applications that use your on-premises PostgreSQL databases to connect to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
