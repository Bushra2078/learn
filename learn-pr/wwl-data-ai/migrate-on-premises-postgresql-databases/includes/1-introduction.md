Azure Database for PostgeSQL is an adapted version of PostgreSQL to take full advantage of the Azure platform. It's closely integrated with Azure services and is fully managed by Microsoft. Microsoft handles the updates and patches to the software, and provide an SLA guarantee of 99.99% availability.

You work as a database developer for an online retailer. Their systems store information in a database that currently runs using PostgreSQL on an Azure VM. As part of a hardware rationalization exercise, AdventureWorks want to move the database to an Azure-managed database. Your company wants to reduce the management overhead of keeping PostgreSQL updated and performant.

In this module, you'll learn about the benefits of migrating PostgreSQL workloads to Azure, and the features that Azure provides to help manage and optimize PostgreSQL systems. You'll see how to create an instance of the Azure Database for PostgreSQL service, and then you'll learn how to migrate on-premises PostgreSQL databases to Azure. You'll also see how to reconfigure an application that uses the database to connect to Azure instead.

## Learning objectives  

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the features and limitations of Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Migrate an on-premises PostgreSQL database to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Reconfigure existing applications that use your on-premises PostgreSQL databases to connect to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
