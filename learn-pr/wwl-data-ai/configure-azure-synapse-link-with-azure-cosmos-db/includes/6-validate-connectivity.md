    You will note that the SQL script template requires the Azure Cosmos DB account key **(5)** for the account we are trying to connect to.

    ![Getting access keys for a storage account.](../media/get-access-key.png)

5.	You can retrieve this from the Azure Cosmos DB account by 
    a.	Clicking on the **Keys** in the left-hand menu **(6)**
    b.	Clicking the **copy icon** next to the PRIMARY KEY value **(7)**

    ![adding access keys into a query.](../media/add-access-keys.png)

6.	And past the key value from the clipboard back into the query **(5)**

    ![Viewing SQL serverless query results.](../media/view-query-results.png)

7.	Now we can click the **Run** button.

    You should almost immediately see the query begin to execute and the shortly thereafter receive back a result set **(7)**

    > [!Note]
    > That for records where data was not defined, such as the name column for the salesOrder record we get back a null value **(8)**

    ![Viewing JSON objects in the query results.](../media/view-json-query-results.png)

    You will see that columns that contain JSON objects, such as address **(A)** and JSON arrays such a detail has the JSON as their column value content. 

8.	You can now close the SQL script and discard the changes by clicking the Close and discard changes on the dialog that pops up
