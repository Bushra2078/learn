In order to query the data within our Cosmos DB analytical store from Azure Synapse using Spark we need to configure a linked service 

## Configure Azure Synapse Linked Service for Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API

To configure the Azure Synapse Linked Service for Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API perform the following steps:
 
![Azure Synapse Studio.](../media/azure-synapse-studio.png)

1.	Connect to a previous deployed Azure Synapse Workspace within which you have running an Azure Synapse SQL Serverless instance **(deployed by default with the workspace)** and an Azure Synapse Spark Pool **(you need to have previously deployed this)**. 
 
    ![Adding a new resource in Azure Synapse Studio.](../media/new-resource-azure-synapse-studio.png)

2.	In the left-hand menu select **Data (1)**

3.	Click on the **Linked tab** in the explorer view **(2)**

4.	Click the **+ button** to add a resource **(3)**
 
    ![Connect to external data in Azure Synapse Studio.](../media/connect-to-external-data-azure-synapse-studio.png)

5.	Select **Connect to external data** from the list that pops up **(4)**
 
    ![Connect to Cosmos DB in Azure Synapse Studio.](../media/connect-to-cosmos-db-azure-synapse-studio.png)

6.	Select **Azure Cosmos DB SQL API**

7.	Click **Continue** 
 
    ![Configuring Cosmos DB linked service in Azure Synapse Studio.](../media/cosmos-db-linked-service-azure-synapse-studio.png)

8.	Type **AdventureWorksSQL** as the name of our linked service **(7)**

9.	Select the **Azure Subscription** in which the previously configured Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API account exists from the drop-down list **(8)**

10.	Select the **Azure Cosmos DB account** from the drop-down list **(9)**

11.	Select the **Sales** database for the drop-down list.

12.	Click **Test connection**. 

    You should immediately receive confirmation that the connection was successful.

13.	Click **Create**.

You are done creating your Linked service for your Azure Cosmos DB Core **(SQL)** API
