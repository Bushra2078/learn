Business analysts, data engineers and data scientists can now use Synapse Spark or Synapse SQL interchangeably to run near real-time business intelligence, analytics, and machine learning pipelines. You can achieve this without impacting the performance of your transactional workloads on Azure Cosmos DB.

Azure Synapse Link creates a tight, seamless integration between Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Synapse Analytics. Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB is supported for SQL API and Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB. This module uses Azure Cosmos DB account configurations for both, highlighting the similarities and differences in their default schema representations.
