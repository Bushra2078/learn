Data classification in Microsoft Purview is similar to subject tagging, and is used to mark and identify data of a specific type that's found within your data estate during scanning. Classification is based on the business context of the data. 

Prior to data classification and labeling, data assets must be registered and scanned in Microsoft Purview. After assets are registered, scanned, classified, and labeled, analysts and other data consumers can easily identify and use data assets.
