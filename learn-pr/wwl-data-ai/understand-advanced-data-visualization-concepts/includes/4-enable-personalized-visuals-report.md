In an enterprise organization, it can be difficult to design a single report that meets everyone's needs, so one solution is using **personalized visuals**. These allow individual consumers to make minor design changes to best understand the data themselves. 

> [!TIP]
> This is a powerful feature for more advanced report consumers. Empower your users by sharing the [Power BI Consumer Documentation](power-bi/consumer/end-user-personalize-visuals) for personalized visuals.

## What can consumers change

Report consumers can make changes for the following items:

* Visualization type
* Swap measure or dimension
* Add/remove legend
* Compare multiple measures
* Change aggregations

After personalizing the report, consumers can create a personal bookmark to save their changes, and even [share changes](power-bi/consumer/end-user-bookmarks#share-changes) with others. Best of all, they can always **reset to default** to restore the report view.

## Enable personalized visuals

You can enable personalized visuals in Power BI Desktop or Power BI service.

* In Power BI Desktop, go to **File > Options and settings > Options > Current file > Report settings**. Make sure **Personalize visuals** is turned on.
* In Power BI service, go to **Settings** on the specific report, then toggle **Personalize Visuals** on, and **Save**.

By default, when you enable personalized visuals, it's enabled for all visuals in a report. You can modify each visual to allow personalization or not. You'll need to enable this setting for each report.

> [!TIP]
> Use a Power BI Template (.PBIT) file to enable personalized visuals and add on top of your custom theme for faster report building in the future.
