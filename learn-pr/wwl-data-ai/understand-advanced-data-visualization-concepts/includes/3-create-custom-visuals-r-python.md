While Power BI offers a wide variety of native visualizations, and even more through AppSource, you may have times when R or Python programming is the best choice to represent your data. If the R and Python visuals available in Power BI and Microsoft AppSource don't meet your needs, you can also create a custom visual.

> [!NOTE]
> This module won't go in-depth for creating R and Python visuals, however you can review the [Add an R or Python visual](/learn/modules/visuals-power-bi/6-python-visual) MSLearn unit for more detail.

## R visuals

In order to develop R visuals, you'll need a supported version of R installed first. Then add the R visual to the canvas, just like using a table or bar chart visual, and add your R code within the visual.

## Python visuals

There are no prerequisites for creating custom Python visuals - just bring the visual onto the canvas, and start writing your Python script.
