*Regression* is a form of machine learning that is used to predict a numeric *label* based on an item's *features*. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.

 Regression is an example of a *supervised* machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to *fit* the feature combinations to the label. Then, after training has been completed, you can use the trained model to predict labels for new items for which the label is unknown.

You can use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning designer to create regression models by using a drag and drop visual interface, without needing to write any code.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Use Azure Machine Learning designer to train a regression model.
- Use a regression model for inferencing.
- Deploy a regression model as a service.

To complete this module, you'll need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).
