Regression is a form of machine learning used to understand the relationships between variables to  predict a desired outcome. Regression predicts a numeric *label* or outcome based on variables, or *features*. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.

Regression is an example of a *supervised* machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to *fit* the feature combinations to the label. Then, after training has been completed, you can use the trained model to predict labels for new items for which the label is unknown.

## Scenarios for regression machine learning models 

Regression machine learning models are used in many industries. A few common scenarios for using regression machine learning models are: 
* Using characteristics of houses, such as square footage and number of rooms, to predict home prices.
* Using characteristics of farm conditions, such as weather and soil quality, to predict crop yield.    
* Using characteristics of a past campaign, such as advertising logs, to predict future advertisement clicks.
