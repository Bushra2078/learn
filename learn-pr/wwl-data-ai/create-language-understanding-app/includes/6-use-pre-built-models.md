You can create your own language models by defining all the intents and utterances it requires, but often you can use prebuilt model elements that encapsulate common intents and entities.

The Language Understanding service provides prebuilt model elements at three different levels of granularity:

- Prebuilt **Domains** define complete language understanding models that include predefined intents, utterances, and entities. Prebuilt domains include *Calendar*, *Email*, *Weather*, *RestaurantReservation*, *HomeAutomation*, and others.
- Prebuilt **Intents** include predefined intents and utterances, such as *CreateCalendarEntry*, *SendEmail*, *TurnOn*, *AddToDo*, and others.
- Prebuilt **Entities** define commonly used entities, such as *Age*, *Email*, *PersonName*, *Number*, *Geography*, *DateTime*, and others.

Using prebuilt model elements can significantly reduce the time it takes to develop a language understanding solution.
