The Text Analytics API is a cloud-based service that provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes four main functions: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, named entity recognition, and language detection.

The Key Phrase Extraction API evaluates unstructured text, and for each JSON document, returns a list of key phrases. Key phrase extraction is useful if you need to quickly identify the main points in a collection of documents.
