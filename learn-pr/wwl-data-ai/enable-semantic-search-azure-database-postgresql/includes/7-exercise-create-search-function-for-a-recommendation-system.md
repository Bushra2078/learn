Now, let's wrap the vector embedding logic and API calls in a function. In this exercise, you install the `vector` and `azure_ai` extensions in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, and explore the extension's capabilities for integrating [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) into your database.

> [!Note]
