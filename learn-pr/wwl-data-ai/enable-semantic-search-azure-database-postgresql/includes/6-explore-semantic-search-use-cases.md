With semantic search, applications can provide a search experience built on context and intent, not just keywords. This type of search is helpful for many use cases. Here are some examples.

## Semantic search use cases

### Personalization

User preferences and activity can be captured as an embedding vector. This vector can be used to influence search rankings. For example, book recommendation systems might rank books by their similarity to a search query and a preference for historical nonfiction.

### Knowledge management systems

The content on intranets and other knowledge management systems is often built over time with loose or even unmaintained structure. Semantic search helps companies organize and find information by the intent and context of documents, not just their keywords. With an embedding model trained in the company's domain, this organization can be even more precise.

### E-commerce

Semantic search allows applications to provide customers with relevant product results without relying on keyword match. This method reduces the effort to maintain keywords, or have awkward descriptions that optimize for lexical search. Instead, customers search by intent and meaning. This type of search can also bridge the gap between technical domains, such as computer parts, and customer vocabulary. For example, searching for "main chip" could match CPUs before other kinds of chips.

### Nontextual use cases

There are many ways to use semantic search beyond text. Semantic search's core feature is computing the similarity of embedding vectors. A model can generate embeddings for text input, or other inputs such as image pixels. An image model can be trained on object recognition, to allow users to search for photos that contain objects contained in a query photo.
