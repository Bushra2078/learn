You're building a vacation rental booking site. Listing search results must be relevant for all customers, and you don't have resources to manually augment listings with keywords for properties that come and go.

You learned about using semantic search in Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server to query using embeddings generated by Azure OpenAI. You accomplished this by:

- Enabling the `pgvector` and `azure_ai` extensions.
- Creating vector columns to store embeddings.
- Generating and storing embeddings.
- Querying the database using a query vector.

Without semantic search, queries such as "sunny" don't match products called "bright natural light" even though it's an intended match. While this can be solved by maintaining additional product keywords, this creates toil when adding new listings. If the keywords aren't added, the product may be undiscoverable without an exact keyword match.

Listings that are hard to find are hard to book. Irrelevant search results degrade the user experience, and manual keyword maintenance increases human costs. On the other hand, Azure OpenAI automates synonym matching by generating embedding vectors, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL does the vector query heavy lifting. This provides a rich & relevant search experience without tedious keyword optimization.
