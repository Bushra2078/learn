Semantic search augments standard keyword search with semantic similarity. This similarity means a query for "sunny" could match the text "bright natural light" even though there's no lexical overlap longer than one letter. Instead of character similarity, semantic search uses embedding vectors produced by artificial intelligence (AI) to measure query and document similarity. This provides more relevant search results.

This module shows you how to enable semantic search in Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server, and uses Azure OpenAI to generate vector embeddings.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a company that manages vacation property listings. You want to let customers search & book listings online. One challenge is the many different words people use to describe the same things. You have limited resources to develop & maintain keyword lists as descriptions change and properties come and go, and manual keyword entry is error-prone. You want to provide relevant search results without manual keyword lists.

## What will we be doing?

We get an overview of semantic search, embeddings, and vector databases. Then we enable the `pgvector` and `azure_ai` extensions. With these extensions, we'll execute semantic search over vector columns generated from Azure OpenAI embeddings using the `azure_ai` extension. Lastly, we write a search function that receives a query string, generates embeddings for that query, and executes semantic search against the database.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, we're able to execute semantic searches using Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server against vector embeddings generated by Azure OpenAI.
