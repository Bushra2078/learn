The first step to implementing semantic search is to generate and store embeddings. In this exercise, you'll install the `vector` and `azure_ai` extensions in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, then apply the extensions to store embedding vectors generated by [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview). Finally, you'll get query string embedding vectors, and run a vector similarity search.

> To complete this exercise, you will need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) and you need to be approved for Azure OpenAI access. If you need Azure OpenAI access, apply at the [Azure OpenAI limited access](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access) page.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
