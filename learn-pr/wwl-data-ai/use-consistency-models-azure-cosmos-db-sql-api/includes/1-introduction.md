As a distributed database, Azure Cosmos DB offers a sliding scale of consistency options that can map to your applicationâ€™s needs much closer than the binary (strong/weak consistency) option provided by many data platforms. In this module, you will explore the consistency options in Azure Cosmos DB and how they can be configured.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Configure default consistency level for an Azure Cosmos DB account
- Change the consistency level on a per-request basis
