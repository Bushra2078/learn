The SQL query editor in Microsoft Fabric is a versatile tool that supports Transact-SQL (T-SQL), allowing you to create and run scripts to query your data warehouse. It also provides features such as IntelliSense and debugging to aid in the development process.

T-SQL allows users, analysts and developers to manipulate the data stored in a warehouse.

## Launch a SQL query editor

The SQL query editor is not just about querying; it’s about managing your data effectively. Whether you’re creating a new table, inserting rows into a table, granting objects permission or executing complex queries, the SQL query editor is designed to make these tasks seamless.

To launch the SQL query editor, you need to select your warehouse asset from **My workspace**. This step will connect to your data warehouse automatically, without you having to prompt any connection information.  

From the warehouse **Explorer**, there are a few ways to create a SQL query editor.

1. **Home menu:** Select **New SQL query** or select any of the templates available.
2. **Queries node:** Select **...** in **My queries**, then select **New SQL Query**.
3. **Query tab:** This option opens a new query editor.

No matter how you initiate a new query editor, a new query item is created automatically.

Any query or script created is automatically saved.
