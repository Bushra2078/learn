Use the Azure Machine Learning CLI (v2) to deploy a machine learning model to a managed online endpoint.

You're the machine learning engineer for a company that sells bikes. The data science team has trained a model to predict customer churn. The model is trained and tracked in Azure Machine Learning. You want to share the model with the marketing team, as they want to use the model to know who they need to approach with a special offer to avoid churn.

You want to deploy the model to a real-time endpoint. The marketing team will call the endpoint when they need to get a list of customers to email special offers to.

After this module, you'll be able to deploy a model to an online endpoint managed by Azure Machine Learning with the CLI (v2).
