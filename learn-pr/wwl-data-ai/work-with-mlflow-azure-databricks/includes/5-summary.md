In this module, you learned how to use MLflow to manage your machine learning lifecycle. Specifically, you learned how to use MLflow to track machine learning experiments, where each experiment run can record parameters, metrics, artifacts, source code, and model.

Now that you have concluded this module, you should know:

1. Use MLflow to track experiments, log metrics, and compare runs

## Cleanup
