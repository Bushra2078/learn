Imagine that you work as a data scientist for a Bike Share company. Your team has started experimenting with machine learning algorithms to predict seasonal, bike rental demand. You team realizes that managing the machine learning workflow is challenging because of difficulty in tracking various experiments, ensuring that experiments are reproducible, and providing a standard way to package and deploy trained models. You have been tasked to investigate frameworks for managing the machine learning lifecycle with minimal changes to integrate with your existing codebase.
