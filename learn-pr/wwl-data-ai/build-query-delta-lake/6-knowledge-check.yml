  - content: "What is the Databricks Delta command to display metadata?"
    choices:
    - content: "MSCK DETAIL *tablename*"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MSCK is for repairing tables."
    - content: "DESCRIBE DETAIL *tableName*"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You display metadata by using DESCRIBE DETAIL *tableName*."
    - content: "SHOW SCHEMA *tablename*"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. No such command is available."
  - content: "How do you perform UPSERT in a Delta dataset?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use UPSERT INTO *my-table*"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The syntax isn't correct for this operation."
    - content: "Use UPSERT INTO *my-table* /MERGE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The syntax isn't correct for this operation."
    - content: "Use MERGE INTO *my-table* USING *data-to-upsert*"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's the correct syntax to perform UPSERT in a Databricks Delta dataset."
  - content: "What optimization does the following command perform: OPTIMIZE Students ZORDER BY Grade?"
    choices:
    - content: "Creates an order-based index on the Grade field to improve filters against that field"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. ZORDER does not manage indexes."
    - content: "Ensures that all data backing, for example, Grade=8 is colocated, then updates a graph that routes requests to the appropriate files"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While ZORDER colocates data based on values in this field, it does not update a graph to route queries."
    - content: "Ensures that all data backing, for example, Grade=8 is colocated, then rewrites the sorted data into new Parquet files"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. ZOrdering colocates related information in the same set of files."
  - content: "What size does OPTIMIZE compact small files to?"
    choices:
    - content: "Around 100 MB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Spark optimization team decided on 1 GB for speed and performance."
    - content: "Around 1 GB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Spark optimization team determined this value to be a good compromise between speed and performance."
    - content: "Around 500 MB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Spark optimization team decided on 1 GB for speed and performance."
