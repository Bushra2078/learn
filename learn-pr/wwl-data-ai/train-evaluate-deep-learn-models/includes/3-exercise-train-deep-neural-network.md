So far in this module, you've learned a lot about the theory and principles of deep learning with neural networks. The best way to learn how to apply this theory is to actually build a deep learning model, and that's what you'll do in this exercise.

## Try for yourself

There are many frameworks available for training deep neural networks, and in this exercise you can choose to explore either (or both) of two of the most popular deep learning frameworks for Python: *PyTorch* and *Tensorflow*. To complete the exercise, you'll need:

- A Microsoft Azure subscription.
- A Visual Studio Codespace based on the **MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics** GitHub repository.

If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true).

If you have not already created a Codespace based on the **MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics** repository, complete the following steps to do so:

1. Open <a href = "https://online.visualstudio.com/environments/new?azure-portal=true&name=ml-basics&repo=MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Codespaces</a> in a new browser tab; and if prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. Create a Codespace with the following settings (if you don't already have a Visual Studio Codespaces billing plan, you'll be prompted to create one):
    - **Codespace Name**: *A name for your Codespace - for example, **ml-basics**.*
    - **Git Repository**: MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics
    - **Instance Type**: Standard (Linux) 4 cores, 8GB RAM
    - **Suspend idle Codespace after**: 30 minutes
3. Wait for the Codespace to be created. This will take around 3 minutes. You'll see the following things happen:
    - A script will initialize and configure your Codespace.
    - A list of notebook (.ipynb) files will appear in the pane on the left.
4. After preparation is complete, you can close the **Welcome** and **Creation Log** panes. You can also change the color scheme to suit your preference - just click the **&#9881;** icon at the bottom left and select a new **Color Theme**. A light color theme may make it easier to read the Python code in the notebooks.

After you've created the environment, open the **Deep Neural Networks (PyTorch).ipynb** or **Deep Neural Networks (Tensorflow).ipynb** notebook, depending on your framework preference, and follow the instructions it contains.

> [!NOTE]
> We highly recommend using a Visual Studio Codespace hosted in Azure for this exercise - this setup ensures the correct version of Python and the various packages you will need are installed. If you prefer to complete the exercise using your own computer, and you have experience configuring Python development environments, you can find details for configuring a local development environment [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics/blob/master/local-setup.md?azure-portal=true).

When you've finished working through the notebook, return to this module and move on to the next unit to learn more.
