PyTorch and Tensorflow both offer comprehensive support for building convolutional neural networks as classification models for images.

## Try for yourself

In this exercise, you'll use your preferred framework to create a simple CNN-based image classifier for images of simple geometric shapes. The same principles can be applied to images of any kind. To complete the exercise, you'll need:

- A Microsoft Azure subscription.
- A Visual Studio Codespace based on the **MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics** GitHub repository.

If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true).

If you have not already created a Codespace based on the **MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics** repository, complete the following steps to do so:

1. Open <a href = "https://online.visualstudio.com/environments/new?azure-portal=true&name=ml-basics&repo=MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Codespaces</a> in a new browser tab; and if prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. Create a Codespace with the following settings (if you don't already have a Visual Studio Codespaces billing plan, you'll be prompted to create one):
    - **Codespace Name**: *A name for your Codespace - for example, **ml-basics**.*
    - **Git Repository**: MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics
    - **Instance Type**: Standard (Linux) 4 cores, 8GB RAM
    - **Suspend idle Codespace after**: 30 minutes
3. Wait for the Codespace to be created. This will take around 3 minutes. You'll see the following things happen:
    - A script will initialize and configure your Codespace.
    - A list of notebook (.ipynb) files will appear in the pane on the left.
4. After preparation is complete, you can close the **Welcome** and **Creation Log** panes. You can also change the color scheme to suit your preference - just click the **&#9881;** icon at the bottom left and select a new **Color Theme**. A light color theme may make it easier to read the Python code in the notebooks.

After you've created the environment, open the **Convolutional Neural Networks (PyTorch).ipynb** or **Convolutional Neural Networks (Tensorflow).ipynb** notebook, depending on your framework preference, and follow the instructions it contains.

> [!NOTE]
> We highly recommend using a Visual Studio Codespace hosted in Azure for this exercise - this setup ensures the correct version of Python and the various packages you will need are installed. If you prefer to complete the exercise using your own computer, and you have experience configuring Python development environments, you can find details for configuring a local development environment [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics/blob/master/local-setup.md?azure-portal=true).

When you've finished working through the notebook, return to this module and more to the next unit to check your knowledge.
