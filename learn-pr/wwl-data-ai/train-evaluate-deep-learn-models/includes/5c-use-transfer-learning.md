PyTorch and Tensorflow both support a library of existing models that you can use as the basis for transfer learning.

## Try for yourself

In this exercise, you'll use your preferred framework to train a convolutional neural network model by using transfer learning.

To complete the exercise:

1. Return to the Visual Studio Codespace you created previously, reconnecting and resuming it if it has been suspended.
2. Open the **Transfer Learning (PyTorch).ipynb** or **Transfer Learning (Tensorflow).ipynb** notebook, depending on your framework preference, and follow the instructions it contains.

When you've finished working through the notebook, return to this module and move on to the next unit to check your knowledge.
