Every day, the world generates a vast quantity of data; much of it text-based in the form of emails, social media posts, online reviews, buisness documents, and more. Artificial intelligence techniques that apply statistical and semantic modeling enable you to create applications that extract meaning and insights from this text-based data.

In this module, you will learn how to use the Text Analytics service to:

- Detect language
