Data engineering is a well established industry role and doesn't drastically change within Azure. In fact, it's quite similar to an approach an organization with Big Data in-house would take. This approach allows for the leveraging of the both commercial and open soure software (OSS) which allows the customer to use the best tool to fit their needs offering scalability and flexibility in a manner that doesn't require extended lead times for new hardware or software.
