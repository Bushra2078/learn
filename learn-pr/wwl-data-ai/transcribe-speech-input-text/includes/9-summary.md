The Speech Translation API lets you add end-to-end, real-time, multilanguage translation of speech to your applications, tools, and devices. The same API can be used for both speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation.

With the Speech Translation API, client applications use speech audio with the Speech service, and receive back a stream of results. These results include the recognized text in the source language. Interim translations can be provided until an utterance is complete, at which time a final translation is provided.

The Speech Translation API uses the same technologies that power various Microsoft products and services. This service is already used by thousands of businesses worldwide in their applications and workflows.
