The **Computer Vision** service is designed to help you extract information from images. It provides functionality that you can use for:

- *Description and tag generation* - determining an appropriate caption for an image, and identifying relevant "tags" that can be used as keywords to indicate its subject.
- *Object detection* - detecting the presence and location of specific objects within the image.
- *Face detection* - detecting the presence, location, and features of human faces in the image.
- *Image metadata, color, and type analysis* - determining the format and size of an image, its dominant color palette, and whether it contains clip art.
- *Category identification* - identifying an appropriate categorization for the image, and if it contains any known landmarks.
- *Brand detection* - detecting the presence of any known brands or logos.
- *Moderation rating* - determine if the image includes any adult or violent content.
- *Optical character recognition* - reading text in the image.
- *Smart thumbnail generation* - identifying the main region of interest in the image to create a smaller "thumbnail" version.

You can provision **Computer Vision** as a single-service resource, or you can use the Computer Vision API in a multi-service **Cognitive Services** resource.
