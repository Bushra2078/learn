    - content: "A pair of coordinates for each face, indicating the center of the face"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The location of detected faces are indicated by a coordinates for a rectangular bounding box"
    - content: "Two pairs of coordinates for each face, indicating the location of the eyes"
