The best way to learn about Face is to explore it for yourself.

## Before you start

[!INCLUDE [](../../includes/ai-fundamentals-lab.md)]

## Complete the exercise

After you have set up the Python environment and cloned the **ai-fundamentals** repository, you're ready to explore facial analysis and recognition.

1. Open the **Face Analysis.ipynb** notebook in the **ai-fundamentals** folder. If you're using the notebook editor in Azure Machine Learning studio, use the **&#8810;** button to collapse the file explorer pane and give you more room to focus on the notebook tab.
2. Read the information in the notebook, and run the code cells it contains in order.

## Clean-up

If you used a compute instance in Azure Machine Learning studio, you should stop it to avoid using Azure credits unnecessarily.

1. In Azure Machine Learning studio, view the **Compute** page (under **Manage**).
2. On the **Compute Instances** tab, select your compute instance and then use the **Stop** button to stop it.
