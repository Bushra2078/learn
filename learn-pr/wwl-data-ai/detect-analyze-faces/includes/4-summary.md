While the Computer Vision and Video Indexer services offer face detection features, the Face service and associated APIs provide more capabilities. Which you should choose will ultimately depend on the insights you want to gain from facial detection.  Computer Vision only provides basic face detection.  If you want to look for data around facial landmarks, the Face service is the proper choice.

You can find out more about the Face service in the [service documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/?azure-portal=true).
