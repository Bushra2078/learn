  questions:
  - content: "How does splitting source files help maintain good performance when loading into Synapse Analytics?"
    choices:
    - content: "optimised processing of smaller file sizes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SQL Pools can process large files more efficiently than smaller ones."
    - content: "Compute node to storage segment alignment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SQL Pools have 60 storgae segments. Compute can also scale to 60 nodes and so optimising for alignment of these 2 resources can dramatically decrease load times."
    - content: "Reduced possibility of data corruptions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data corruptions have an impact on success, not speed. Splitting files should affect probability of corruptions."
  - content: "Which Workload Management Capability manages minimum and maximum resource allocations during peak periods?"
    choices:
    - content: "Workload Isolation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Workload Isolation assigns maximum and minimum usage values for varying resources under load. These adjustments can be done live without having to take the SQL Pool offline."
    - content: "Workload Importance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Workload Importance allows higher priority queries to receive resources immediately regardless of queue length."
    - content: "Workload Containment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Workload Containment refers to limiting the amount of resources a workload group can consume."
  - content: "Which T-SQL Statement allows you to load data directly from Azure Storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "LOAD DATA."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. LOAD DATA is a databricks command that loads data into a Hive table from a directory or file."
    - content: "COPY."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The T-SQL COPY Statement reads data from Azure Blob Storage or the Azure Data Lake and inserts it into a table within the SQL Pool."
    - content: "INSERT FROM FILE."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Insert from file is not a valid T-SQL Statement."
