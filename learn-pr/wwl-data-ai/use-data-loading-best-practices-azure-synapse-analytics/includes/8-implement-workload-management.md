Azure Synapse Analytics allows you to create, control, and manage resource availability when workloads are competing. This allows you to manage the relative importance of each workload when waiting for available resources.

To facilitate faster load times, you can create a workload classifier for the load user with the “importance” set to above_normal or High. Workload importance ensures that the load takes precedence over other waiting tasks of a lower importance rating. Use this in conjunction with your own workload group definitions for workload isolation to manage minimum and maximum resource allocations during peak and quiet periods.

Dedicated SQL pool workload management in Azure Synapse consists of three high-level concepts: 
-	Workload Classification
-	Workload Importance 
-	Workload Isolation

These capabilities give you more control over how your workload utilizes system resources.

## Workload classification

Workload management classification allows workload policies to be applied to requests through assigning resource classes and importance.

While there are many ways to classify data warehousing workloads, the simplest and most common classification is load and query. You load data with insert, update, and delete statements. You query the data using selects. A data warehousing solution will often have a workload policy for load activity, such as assigning a higher resource class with more resources. A different workload policy could apply to queries, such as lower importance compared to load activities.

You can also subclassify your load and query workloads. Subclassification gives you more control of your workloads. For example, query workloads can consist of cube refreshes, dashboard queries or ad-hoc queries. You can classify each of these query workloads with different resource classes or importance settings. Load can also benefit from subclassification. Large transformations can be assigned to larger resource classes. Higher importance can be used to ensure key sales data is loaded before weather data or a social data feed.

Not all statements are classified as they do not require resources or need importance to influence execution. DBCC commands, BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK TRANSACTION statements are not classified.

## Workload importance

Workload importance influences the order in which a request gets access to resources. On a busy system, a request with higher importance has first access to resources. Importance can also ensure ordered access to locks. There are five levels of importance: low, below_normal, normal, above_normal, and high. Requests that don't set importance are assigned the default level of normal. Requests that have the same importance level have the same scheduling behavior that exists today.

## Workload isolation

Workload isolation reserves resources for a workload group. Resources reserved in a workload group are held exclusively for that workload group to ensure execution. Workload groups also allow you to define the amount of resources that are assigned per request, much like resource classes do. Workload groups give you the ability to reserve or cap the amount of resources a set of requests can consume. Finally, workload groups are a mechanism to apply rules, such as query timeout, to requests.
