### Create a workload classifier to add importance to certain queries

Your organization has asked you if there is a way to mark queries executed by the CEO as more important than others, so they don't appear slow due to heavy data loading or other workloads in the queue. You decide to create a workload classifier and add importance to prioritize the CEO's queries. Keep in mind that workload groups correspond to resources classes which are created automatically for backward compatibility and cannot be dropped. 
    
> [!Note] 
> Eight (8) additional user-defined workload groups can be created in addition to the system defined workload groups and should be used sparingly and not take excessive amount of resources.

1. Select the **Develop** hub. 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![The develop hub is highlighted.](../media/develop-hub.png)

2. From the **Develop** menu, select the **+** button **(1)** and choose **SQL Script (2)** from the context menu.

    ![The SQL script context menu item is highlighted.](../media/synapse-studio-new-sql-script.png)

3. In the toolbar menu, connect to the **SQL Pool** database to execute the query.

    ![The connect to option is highlighted in the query toolbar.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-connect.png)

4. In the query window, replace the script with the following to confirm that there are no queries currently being run by users logged in as `asa.sql.workload01`, representing the CEO of the organization or `asa.sql.workload02` representing the data analyst working on the project:

    ```sql
    --First, let's confirm that there are no queries currently being run by users logged in workload01 or workload02

    SELECT s.login_name, r.[Status], r.Importance, submit_time, 
    start_time ,s.session_id FROM sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions s 
    JOIN sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r ON s.session_id = r.session_id
    WHERE s.login_name IN ('asa.sql.workload01','asa.sql.workload02') and Importance
    is not NULL AND r.[status] in ('Running','Suspended') 
    --and submit_time>dateadd(minute,-2,getdate())
    ORDER BY submit_time ,s.login_name
    ```

5. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is highlighted in the query toolbar.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

    Now that we have confirmed that there are no running queries, we need to flood the system with queries and see what happens for `asa.sql.workload01` and `asa.sql.workload02`. To do this, we'll run a Azure Synapse Pipeline which triggers queries.

6. Select the **Integrate** hub.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![The integrate hub is highlighted.](../media/integrate-hub.png)

7. Select the **Lab 08 - Execute Data Analyst and CEO Queries** Pipeline **(1)**, which will run / trigger the `asa.sql.workload01` and `asa.sql.workload02` queries. Select **Add trigger (2)**, then **Trigger now (3)**. In the dialog that appears, select **OK**.

    ![The add trigger and trigger now menu items are highlighted.](../media/trigger-data-analyst-queries-pipeline.png)

8. Let's see what happened to all the queries we just triggered as they flood the system. In the query window, replace the script with the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.login_name, r.[Status], r.Importance, submit_time, start_time ,s.session_id FROM sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions s 
    JOIN sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r ON s.session_id = r.session_id
    WHERE s.login_name IN ('asa.sql.workload01','asa.sql.workload02') and Importance
    is not NULL AND r.[status] in ('Running','Suspended') and submit_time>dateadd(minute,-2,getdate())
    ORDER BY submit_time ,status
    ```

9. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is highlighted again in the query toolbar.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

    You should see an output similar to the following:

    ![Viewing the SQL query results.](../media/sql-query-2-results.png)

    Notice that the **Importance** level for all queries is set to **normal**.

10. We will give our `asa.sql.workload01` user queries priority by implementing the **Workload Importance** feature. In the query window, replace the script with the following:

    ```sql
    IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.workload_management_workload_classifiers WHERE name = 'CEO')
    BEGIN
        DROP WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CEO;
    END
    CREATE WORKLOAD CLASSIFIER CEO
      WITH (WORKLOAD_GROUP = 'largerc'
      ,MEMBERNAME = 'asa.sql.workload01',IMPORTANCE = High);
    ```

    We are executing this script to create a new **Workload Classifier** named `CEO` that uses the `largerc` Workload Group and sets the **Importance** level of the queries to **High**.

11. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is selected in the query toolbar.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

12. Let's flood the system again with queries and see what happens this time for `asa.sql.workload01` and `asa.sql.workload02` queries. To do this, we'll run an Azure Synapse Pipeline which triggers queries. **Select** the `Integrate` Tab, **run** the **Lab 08 - Execute Data Analyst and CEO Queries** Pipeline, which will run / trigger the `asa.sql.workload01` and `asa.sql.workload02` queries.

13. In the query window, replace the script with the following to see what happens to the `asa.sql.workload01` queries this time:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.login_name, r.[Status], r.Importance, submit_time, start_time ,s.session_id FROM sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions s 
    JOIN sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r ON s.session_id = r.session_id
    WHERE s.login_name IN ('asa.sql.workload01','asa.sql.workload02') and Importance
    is not NULL AND r.[status] in ('Running','Suspended') and submit_time>dateadd(minute,-2,getdate())
    ORDER BY submit_time ,status desc
    ```

14. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is selected again in the query toolbar.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

    You should see an output similar to the following:

    ![SQL query results.](../media/sql-query-4-results.png)

    Notice that the queries executed by the `asa.sql.workload01` user have a **high** importance.

15. Select the **Monitor** hub.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![The monitor hub is highlighted.](../media/develop-hub.png)

16. Select **Pipeline runs (1)**, and then select **Cancel recursive (2)** for each running Lab 08 pipelines, marked **In progress (3)**. This will help speed up the remaining tasks.

### Reserve resources for specific workloads through workload isolation

Workload isolation means resources are reserved, exclusively, for a workload group. Workload groups are containers for a set of requests and are the basis for how workload management, including workload isolation, is configured on a system. A simple workload management configuration can manage data loads and user queries.

In the absence of workload isolation, requests operate in the shared pool of resources. Access to resources in the shared pool is not guaranteed and is assigned on an importance basis.

Given the workload requirements provided by Tailwind Traders, you decide to create a new workload group called `CEODemo` to reserve resources for queries executed by the CEO.

Let's start by experimenting with different parameters.

1. In the query window, replace the script with the following:

    ```sql
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.workload_management_workload_groups where name = 'CEODemo')
    BEGIN
        Create WORKLOAD GROUP CEODemo WITH  
        ( MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 10        -- integer value
        ,REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 5 -- integer value
        ,CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 100
        )
    END
    ```

    The script creates a workload group called `CEODemo` to reserve resources exclusively for the workload group. In this example, a workload group with a `MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE` set to 10% and `REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT` set to 5% is guaranteed 2 concurrency.

2. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is highlighted in the toolbar.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

3. In the query window, replace the script with the following to create a Workload Classifier called `CEODreamDemo` that assigns a workload group and importance to incoming requests:

    ```sql
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.workload_management_workload_classifiers where  name = 'CEODreamDemo')
    BEGIN
        Create Workload Classifier CEODreamDemo with
        ( Workload_Group ='CEODemo',MemberName='asa.sql.workload02',IMPORTANCE = BELOW_NORMAL);
    END
    ```

    This script sets the Importance to **BELOW_NORMAL** for the `asa.sql.workload02` user, through the new `CEODreamDemo` Workload Classifier.

4. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is highlighted in the toolbar again.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

5. In the query window, replace the script with the following to confirm that there are no active queries being run by `asa.sql.workload02` (suspended queries are OK):

    ```sql
    SELECT s.login_name, r.[Status], r.Importance, submit_time,
    start_time ,s.session_id FROM sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions s
    JOIN sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r ON s.session_id = r.session_id
    WHERE s.login_name IN ('asa.sql.workload02') and Importance
    is not NULL AND r.[status] in ('Running','Suspended')
    ORDER BY submit_time, status
    ```

6. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is highlighted.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

7. Select the **Integrate** hub.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![The integrate hub is highlighted again.](../media/develop-hub.png "Integrate hub")

8. Select the **Lab 08 - Execute Business Analyst Queries** Pipeline **(1)**, which will run / trigger  `asa.sql.workload02` queries. Select **Add trigger (2)**, then **Trigger now (3)**. In the dialog that appears, select **OK**.

    ![The add trigger menu item.](../media/trigger-business-analyst-queries-pipeline.png)

9. In the query window, replace the script with the following to see what happened to all the `asa.sql.workload02` queries we just triggered as they flood the system:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.login_name, r.[Status], r.Importance, submit_time,
    start_time ,s.session_id FROM sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions s
    JOIN sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r ON s.session_id = r.session_id
    WHERE s.login_name IN ('asa.sql.workload02') and Importance
    is not NULL AND r.[status] in ('Running','Suspended')
    ORDER BY submit_time, status
    ```

10. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is highlighted again.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

    You should see an output similar to the following that shows the importance for each session set to `below_normal`:

    ![The script results shows the session was executed with below normal importance.](../media/sql-result-below-normal.png "SQL script")

    Notice that the running scripts are executed by the `asa.sql.workload02` user **(1)** with an Importance level of **below_normal (2)**. We have successfully configured the business analyst queries to execute at a lower importance than the CEO queries. We can also see that the `CEODreamDemo` Workload Classifier works as expected.

11. Select the **Monitor** hub.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![The monitor hub is highlighted.](../media/develop-hub.png)

12. Select **Pipeline runs (1)**, and then select **Cancel recursive (2)** for each running Lab 08 pipelines, marked **In progress (3)**. This will help speed up the remaining tasks.

    ![The cancel recursive option.](../media/cancel-recursive-option.png)

13. Return to the query window under the **Develop** hub. In the query window, replace the script with the following to set 3.25% minimum resources per request:

    ```sql
    IF  EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.workload_management_workload_classifiers where group_name = 'CEODemo')
    BEGIN
        Drop Workload Classifier CEODreamDemo
        DROP WORKLOAD GROUP CEODemo
        --- Creates a workload group 'CEODemo'.
            Create  WORKLOAD GROUP CEODemo WITH  
        (MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 26 -- integer value
            ,REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 3 -- factor of 26 (guaranteed more than 8 concurrencies)
        ,CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 100
        )
        --- Creates a workload Classifier 'CEODreamDemo'.
        Create Workload Classifier CEODreamDemo with
        (Workload_Group ='CEODemo',MemberName='asa.sql.workload02',IMPORTANCE = BELOW_NORMAL);
    END
    ```

    > [!NOTE] 
    > Configuring workload containment implicitly defines a maximum level of concurrency. With a CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE set to 60% and a REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT set to 1%, up to a 60-concurrency level is allowed for the workload group. Consider the method included below for determining the maximum concurrency:
    > 
    > [Max Concurrency] = [CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE] / [REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT]

14. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

15. Let's flood the system again and see what happens for `asa.sql.workload02`. To do this, we will run an Azure Synapse Pipeline which triggers queries. Select the `Integrate` Tab. **Run** the **Lab 08 - Execute Business Analyst Queries** Pipeline, which will run / trigger  `asa.sql.workload02` queries.

16. In the query window, replace the script with the following to see what happened to all of the `asa.sql.workload02` queries we just triggered as they flood the system:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.login_name, r.[Status], r.Importance, submit_time,
    start_time ,s.session_id FROM sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions s
    JOIN sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r ON s.session_id = r.session_id
    WHERE s.login_name IN ('asa.sql.workload02') and Importance
    is  not NULL AND r.[status] in ('Running','Suspended')
    ORDER BY submit_time, status
    ```

17. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button again.](../media/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png)

    After several moments (up to a minute), we should see several concurrent executions by the `asa.sql.workload02` user running at **below_normal** importance. We have validated that the modified Workload Group and Workload Classifier works as expected.

    ![The script results show that each session was executed with below normal importance.](../media/sql-result-below-normal-2.png)

18. Select the **Monitor** hub.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![The monitor hub is highlighted again.](../media/develop-hub.png)

19. Select **Pipeline runs (1)**, and then select **Cancel recursive (2)** for each running Lab 08 pipelines, marked **In progress (3)**. This will help speed up the remaining tasks.

    ![The cancel recursive option is shown.](../media/cancel-recursive-option.png)
