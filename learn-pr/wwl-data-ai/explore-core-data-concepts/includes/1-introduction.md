Over the last few decades, the amount of data that systems, applications, and devices have generated has increased significantly. Data is everywhere. Data is available in different structures and formats. Understanding data and exploring it reveals interesting facts, and helps you gain meaningful insights. 
 
In this module, you'll learn about how you can organize and process data. You'll learn about relational and non-relational databases, and how data is handled through transactional processing, and through batch and streaming data processing.

To consider how the tools and techniques learnt can be applied in real world scenarios, imagine you're a data analyst for a large consumer organization. The organization wants to understand customer buying patterns from supermarkets. The organization has a number of datasets from different sources, such as till information (point of sale), weather data, and holiday data. The organization would like to use Azure technologies to understand and analyze these datasets. This scenario will be used throughout the module.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Identify how data is defined and stored
- Identify characteristics of relational and non-relational data
- Describe and differentiate data workloads
- Describe and differentiate batch and streaming data
