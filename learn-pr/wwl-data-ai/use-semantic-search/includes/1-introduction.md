Suppose that you work for a company that is developing an app for local tourists. You have huge amounts of information about local tourist sites, but when users search for information sometimes they don't find the most relevant articles at the top of their search results. To improve the usabilty of your app, you're investigating how to return more relevant results to users by using Azure Cognitive Search.

In this module, you'll learn how to improve search results and return more relevant results using semantic search in Azure Cognitive Search.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe semantic search
- Set up semantic search
- Perform semantic search on an index
