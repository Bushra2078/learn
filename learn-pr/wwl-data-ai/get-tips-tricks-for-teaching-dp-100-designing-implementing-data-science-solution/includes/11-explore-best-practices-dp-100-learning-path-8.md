DP-100: Learning Path 8 Train models with scripts in Azure Machine Learning

Learning Path 8 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path, students learn how to run the training script as a command job to help prepare production-ready script. Students also learn about common terminologies like the code, command, environment, and compute.

This learning path consists of two modules:

- Module 1 – Run a training script as a command job in Azure Machine Learning
- Module 2 – Track model training with MLflow in jobs

Learning Path 8 Tips and Tricks

- Illustrate a completed experiment to show status, logs, and outputs 
- Emphasize the difference between logging modes and make sure it's clear before moving forward
Learning Path 8 Demos (optional)
- Show where outputs can be found
- Compare both outputs: in a notebook and in the user interface (UI)
- Show where saved artifacts are located in a local file folder and in Blob storage
