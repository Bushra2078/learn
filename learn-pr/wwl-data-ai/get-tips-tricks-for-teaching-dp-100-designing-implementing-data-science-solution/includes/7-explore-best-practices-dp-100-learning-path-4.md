DP-100: Learning Path 4 Work with compute in Azure Machine Learning

Learning Path 4 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students will learn during the learning path. In this learning path students will learn about compute targets and their immense processing capabilities. Students will also learn about the four types of compute targets (compute instance, compute cluster, Kubernetes cluster, and attached compute) that Azure Machine Learning supports and the ideal use for each type.

This learning path consists of two modules:

- Module 1 – Work with compute targets in Azure Machine Learning
- Module 2 – Work with environments in Azure Machine Learning

Learning Path 4 Tips and Tricks

- Reinforce learning with knowledge check questions
- Discuss multiple types of compute 
- Guide the learners when it is ideal to use each type of compute

Learning Path 4 Demos (optional)

- Create a compute instance or cluster and its configuration 
- Show the curated environments
