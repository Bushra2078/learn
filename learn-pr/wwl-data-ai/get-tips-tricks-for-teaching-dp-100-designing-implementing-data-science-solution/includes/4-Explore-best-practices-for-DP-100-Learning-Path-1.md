DP-100: Learning Path 1 Design a machine learning solution

Learning Path 1 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students will learn during the learning path. In this learning path students will learn about designing a machine learning solution including an overview of the entire machine learning process, general concepts, how to design the various aspects of machine learning projects. Students will also learn about designing a data ingestion strategy, a machine learning model training solution, and designing a modern deployment solution.

This Learning Path consists of three modules:

- Module 1 – Design a data ingestion strategy for machine learning projects
- Module 2 – Design a machine learning model training solution
- Module 3 – Design a model deployment solution
