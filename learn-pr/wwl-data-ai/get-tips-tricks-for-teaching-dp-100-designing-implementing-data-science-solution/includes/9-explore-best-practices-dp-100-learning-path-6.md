DP-100: Learning Path 6 Find the best model with Automated Machine Learning

Learning Path 6 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students will learn during the learning path. In this learning path students will learn about automated machine learning and how to use it to train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models without writing any code.

This learning path consists of two modules:

- Module 1 – Explore Automate Machine Learning
- Module 2 – Find the best classification model with Automated Machine Learning
