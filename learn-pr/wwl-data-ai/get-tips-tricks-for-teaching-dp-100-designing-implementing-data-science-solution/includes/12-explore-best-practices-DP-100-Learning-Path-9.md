DP-100: Learning Path 9 Optimize model training in Azure Machine Learning

Learning Path 9 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students will learn during the learning path. In this learning path students will learn about optimizing the module training in Azure Machine Learning and running the pipelines in Azure Machine Learning. Students will also learn about hyper parameter tuning and how to use the Azure Machine Learning SDK to apply hyper parameter tuning to find the best module.

This learning path consists of two modules:

- Module 1 – Run pipelines in Azure Machine Learning
- Module 2 – Perform hyperparameter tuning with Azure Machine Learning
