In Azure Databricks, data scientists use DataFrames to structure their data. A [DataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.html?azure-portal=true) is equivalent to a relational table in Spark SQL. In this module, you will learn what DataFrames are and how to use them.
