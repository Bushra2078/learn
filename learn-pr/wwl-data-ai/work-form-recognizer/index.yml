title: Extract data from forms with Form Recognizer
summary: Form Recognizer extracts data at scale to enable the submission of documents in real time, at scale, with accuracy. This module teaches you how to use the *Azure Form Recognizer* cognitive service.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll learn how to:
  - Identify where Form Recognizer's prebuilt models and custom models can be built into applications to speed up processes
  - Use Form Recognizer's optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities with SDKs, REST API, and Form OCR Test Tool (FOTT)
  - Develop and test custom models using supervised and unsupervised training
prerequisites: |
  To complete this module, you will need:
  - An active Azure account
  - Knowledge of Azure portal navigation
