Forms are used to communicate information in every industry on a daily basis. Many businesses and individuals still manually extract data from forms to record and exchange information.

Consider some of the instances when a person needs to process form data:   
- When filing claims 
- When enrolling new patients in an online management system 
- When entering data from receipts to an expense report 
- When reviewing a hundred-page operations report for anomalies
- When selecting data from a report to give to a stakeholder 

Without AI services, people would need to manually sort though form documents to identify important pieces of information. People would also need to manually re-enter the data into other structured forms to record it, and perhaps have to complete this task in real time with a customer. 

Form Recognizer services provide the building blocks for automation by using intelligent services to extract data in real time, at scale, with accuracy. *Azure Form Recognizer* is a vision API that identifies and extracts key-value pairs and table data from form documents; then outputs structured data including the relationships in the original file. 

**Uses of the Form Recognizer service include**: 
- Process Automation 
- Knowledge Mining 
- Industry Specific Applications        

**In this module, you'll learn how to**: 

- Identify where Form Recognizer's prebuilt models and custom models can be built into applications to speed up processes 
- Use Form Recognizer's optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities with SDKs, REST API, and Form OCR Test Tool (FOTT)
- Develop and test custom models using supervised and unsupervised training
