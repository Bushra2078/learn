This module focused on understanding Form Recognizer's prebuilt model service, custom model service, and the client library SDKs and REST API used to return results. 

As you work with Form Recognizer services, you may see ways they can be integrated with other Cognitive Services. For example, you can try integrating Form Recognizer with Cognitive Search using [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-form).  

Form recognition is just one part of the overall Vision API in Azure Cognitive Services. Form Recognizer services are ever evolving. You can read about the latest updates [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/whats-new).
