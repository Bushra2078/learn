This module focused on Form Recognizer's prebuilt service, custom service, and its client library SDKs and REST API. We also introduced the Form Recognizer Studio to label and train your model.  

Form Recognizer services can be integrated with other Cognitive Services. For example, you can try using [this tutorial](/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-form) with Form Recognizer and Cognitive Search.  

Form recognition is just one part of the overall Vision API in Azure Cognitive Services. Form Recognizer services are ever evolving. You can read about the latest updates [here](/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/whats-new).
