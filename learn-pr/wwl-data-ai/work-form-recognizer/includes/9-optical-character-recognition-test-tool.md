In addition to SDKs and the REST API, Form Recognizer services can be accessed through a user interface called the Form OCR Test Tool (FOTT). FOTT can be used to analyze form layouts, extract data from prebuilt models, and train custom models. 

> [!NOTE]
> FOTT is in preview, as of the time this content was authored, and as a result, features and usage details may change. You should refer to the [official page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer?azure-portal=true) for the service, for up-to-date information.

FOTT currently supports three types of projects: 
- Use prebuilt model to get data 
- Use Layout to get text, tables, and selection marks 
- Use Custom to train a model with labels and get key value pairs

FOTT can be used in the [browser](https://fott.azurewebsites.net/) or deployed in a container. You can find instructions to use the Docker engine to run FOTT [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/label-tool?tabs=v2-1#set-up-the-sample-labeling-tool). The following overview applies to FOTT in the browser.  

## Use Layout   

FOTT's Layout service enables you to upload a file, analyze it, and download the extracted data in a JSON file and table file. To use the service:  

1. Create a form recognizer or cognitive service resource
2. Select the "Layout" feature in [FOTT](https://fott-preview.azurewebsites.net/). 
3. Analyze your document. You will need your form recognizer or cognitive service endpoint and key. 
    
## Use prebuilt models  

To extract data from common forms with FOTT's prebuilt models:

1. Create a form recognizer or cognitive service resource
2. Select the "prebuilt models" feature in [FOTT](https://fott-preview.azurewebsites.net/). 
3. Analyze your document. You will need your form recognizer or cognitive service endpoint and key.

## Use custom to train a model 

You can use FOTT's custom service for the entire process of training and testing custom models.

When you use FOTT to build custom models, the **ocr.json** files, **labels.json** files, and **fields.json** file needed for supervised training are automatically created and stored in your storage account. 

>[!NOTE]
>In other documentation, you may see the term _Sample Labeling Tool_. This refers to the component of FOTT that covers custom models. 

To train a custom model and use it to extract data with FOTT:

1. Create a form recognizer or cognitive service resource
2. Collect at least 5-6 sample forms for training and upload them to your [storage account container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container). 
3. Generate a shared access security (SAS) URL for the container.
4. Configure cross-domain resource sharing (CORS). CORS enables FOTT to store labeled files in your storage container. 
5. Select the "custom" feature in [FOTT](https://fott-preview.azurewebsites.net/). 
6. Start a new project using your storage container's SAS URL and form recognizer or cognitive service key.
7. Use FOTT [to apply labels to text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/label-tool?tabs=v2-1#apply-labels-to-text). 
8. Train your model. Once the model is trained, you'll receive a Model ID and Average Accuracy for tags.       
9. Test your model by analyzing a new form that was **not** used in training.
