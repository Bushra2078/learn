## Using the REST API 

To extract form data using a custom model, use the [**analyze document**](/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/try-v3-rest-api#analyze-documents-and-get-results) REST API function  with your model ID (generated during model training). This function starts the form analysis and returns a result ID, which you can pass in a subsequent call to the [**get analyze results**](/azure/applied-ai-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/try-v3-rest-api#get-analyze-results-get-request) function to retrieve the results. 

A successful JSON response contains **readResults** and **documentResults** nodes. 

The **readResults** node contains all of the recognized text. Text is organized by page, then by line, then by individual words.

The **documentResults** node contains the form-specific values that the model discovered. This is where you'll find useful key/value pairs like the first name, last name, company name and more.

Depending on the form analyzed, the response may also contain **pageResults**, which includes the tables extracted.

Example **Get Analyze Receipt Result** response:

## Understanding confidence scores 

If the confidence values of the **readResults** are low, try to improve the quality of your input documents. 

You will also want to make sure that the form you are analyzing has a similar appearance to forms in the training set if the confidence values of the **pageResults** are low. If the form appearance varies, consider training more than one model, with each model focused on one form format. 

Depending on the use case, you may find that a confidence score of 80% or above is acceptable for a low-risk application. For more sensitive cases, like reading medical records or billing statements, a score of 100% is recommended.

## Using the SDK
