Relational databases are a common way for transactional applications to store and manage data. They consist of a schema of *tables*, which are linked through common key values. You use SQL to query and manipulate the data in the tables, and can enrich the database by creating objects like views, stored procedures, and indexes.

In this module you learned how to:

- Identify characteristics of relational data
- Define normalization
- Identify types of SQL statement
- Identify common relational database objects
