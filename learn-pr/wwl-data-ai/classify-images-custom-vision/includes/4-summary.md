- **Problem**: Classifying images manually is time consuming and difficult to scale. Training an effective machine learning model to classify images is a complex task that requires considerable expertise in data science and machine learning.
- **Solution**: You can use the Custom Vision service to train image classification models and deploy as AI solutions in applications.
- **Advantages**: The Custom Vision service simplifies the process for creating custom image classification models. You can use the service with minimal knowledge of deep learning techniques. 
- **Impact**: You can automate and accelerate processes especially as projects scale in size. 

You can find out more about the Custom Vision service in the [service documentation](/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service).

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
