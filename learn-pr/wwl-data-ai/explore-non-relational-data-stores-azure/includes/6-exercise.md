In the sample scenario, suppose that you've created the following data stores:

- A Cosmos DB for holding information about the products that Contoso manufactures.
- A blob container in Azure Storage for holding the images of products.
- A file share, in the same Azure Storage account, for holding product documentation. 

In this exercise, you'll upload data to these data stores. You'll run queries against the data in the Cosmos DB database. Finally, you'll download and view the images and documents held in Azure Storage.

You'll perform this exercise using the Azure portal and the command line.

## Setup

1. In the Cloud Shell window on the right, run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-explore-non-relational-data-stores-azure.git lab
    ```

    This command copies the scripts and data required to set up the sample Cosmos DB database and Azure Storage account used by this exercise.

2. Move to the **lab** folder.

    ```bash
    cd lab
    ```

3. Run the following command. 

    ```bash
    bash setup.sh
    ```

    This command creates the Cosmos DB database and Azure Storage account. It takes a few minutes to run. When the script has finished, make a note of the values for the Cosmos DB account, database, container, and Storage account names.

4. Download the Data Migration tool for Azure Cosmos DB  from the following link: [Data Migration tool](https://aka.ms/csdmtool). Download and open the zip file, and extract the contents of the **drop** folder to a convenient folder on your computer.

5. Download [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) and run the installer. Use the default options to install the utility.

6. Download [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). Run the installer, and accept the default options.

## Upload product data to Cosmos DB

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).

2. On the home page, select **Azure Cosmos DB**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of home page in the Azure portal. The user has selected **Cosmos DB**](../media/6-home-page.png)

3. On the **Azure Cosmos DB** page, select the Cosmos DB account that was created by the setup script.

4. On the Cosmos DB account page, under **Settings**, select **Keys**. Copy the **PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING** to the clipboard.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of **Keys** page for the Cosmos DB account. The user has selected the primary connection string](../media/6-cosmos-key.png)

5. Switch to your desktop computer.

6. Open a command prompt window, move to a convenient folder, and run the following command to create another copy of the code and data required for the exercise.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You need a copy of the data on your computer because you'll run the tools to upload this data from your desktop.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-explore-non-relational-data-stores-azure.git lab
    ```

7. Using File Explorer, move to the folder where you installed the Data Migration tool.

10. In the **Open** dialog box, browse to the folder on the desktop where you cloned the repository containing the sample data for the exercise, move to the **lab** folder, move to the **products** folder, and select the **productinfo.json** file. Select **Open**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **productinfo.json** file contains the product information in JSON format. If you have time, you can examine the contents of this file using Notepad.

11. Back on the **Source Information** page, select **Next**

12. On the **Target Information** page, enter the following settings, and then select **Next**.

    | Field | Value |
    |-|-|
    | Export to | Azure Cosmos DB - Sequential record import (partitioned collection) | 
    | Connection String | Paste the primary connection string from the clipboard, and append the text *database=ProductData* to the end of the string, after the semi-colon ( ; ) character. |
    | Collection | ProductCatalog |

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Results** page in the Data Migration Tool](../media/6-results.png)

16. Close the Data Migration Tool.

## Query product data in Cosmos DB

1. Return to the Azure portal, and go to your Cosmos DB account.

2. On the **Overview** page for the account, select **Data Explorer**. On the **Data Explorer** page, expand the **ProductData** database, expand the **ProductCatalog** container, and then select **Items**. Verify that the **Items** pane contains a list of products.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the **Items** page for the Cosmos DB container](../media/6-items.png)

3. Select the item with ID 316. A JSON document containing the details for product 316 should appear in the right-hand pane.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the data for product 316](../media/6-document-316.png)

4. In the toolbar, select **New SQL Query**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image of the toolbar. The user has selected **New SQL Query**](../media/6-new-query.png)

5. In the **Query 1** pane, enter the following query, and then select **Execute Query**. This query returns the name, color, listprice, description, and file name of the image for each model of mountain bike that Contoso make. The query should return 32 documents.

    ```SQL
    SELECT p.productname, p.color, p.listprice, p.description, p.images.thumbnail
    FROM products p
    WHERE p.productcategory.subcategory = "Mountain Bikes"
    ```
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Image showing the list of mountain bikes returned by the query](../media/6-mountain-bike-query.png)

6. Modify the query to return information about Road Bikes. 

    ```SQL
    SELECT p.productname, p.color, p.listprice, p.description, p.images.thumbnail
    FROM products p
    WHERE p.productcategory.subcategory = "Road Bikes"
    ```

    The query should return 43 documents.

7. Replace the query with the following text. This query counts the number of Touring Bikes.

    ```SQL
    SELECT COUNT(p.productname)
    FROM products p
    WHERE p.productcategory.subcategory = "Touring Bikes"
    ```

    The data is returned as a document with a field named "$1" that has the value 22.

    ```text
    [
        {
            "$1": 22
        }
    ]
    ```

8. Modify the query, and add the **VALUE** keyword as shown below.  

    ```SQL
    SELECT VALUE COUNT(p.productname)
    FROM products p
    WHERE p.productcategory.subcategory = "Touring Bikes"
    ```

    This time the query just returns the value 22, and doesn't generate a field name.

    ```text
    [
        22
    ]
    ```

9. Run the following query:

    ```SQL
    SELECT VALUE SUM(p.quantityinstock)
    FROM products p
    WHERE p.productcategory.subcategory = "Touring Bikes"
    ```

    This query returns the total number of touring bikes currently in stock. It should return the value 3477.

10. If you have time, experiment with some queries of your own.
