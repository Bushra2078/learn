Non-relational data stores can take many forms. Azure enables you to create non-relational databases using Azure Cosmos DB. Cosmos DB supports several NoSQL models, including document stores, graph databases, key-value stores, and column family databases. Other non-relational stores available in Azure include Azure Storage, which you can use to store blobs and files. In this module, you'll learn how to use these various storage services to store and retrieve data.

Suppose you're a data engineer working at Contoso, an organization with a large manufacturing operation. The organization has to gather and store information from a range of sources, such as real-time data monitoring the status of production line machinery, product quality control data, historical production logs, product volumes in stock, and raw materials inventory data. This information is critical to the operation of the organization. Contoso has created stores for holding this information. You've been asked to upload data to these stores, and investigate how to query this data using the features provided by Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Upload data to a Cosmos DB database, and learn how to query this data.
- Upload and download data in an Azure Storage account.
