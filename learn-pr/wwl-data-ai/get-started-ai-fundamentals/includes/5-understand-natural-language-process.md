Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:

- Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
- Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
- Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
- Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

For example, *Starship Commander* is a virtual reality (VR) game from Human Interact that takes place in a science fiction world. The game uses natural language processing to enable players to control the narrative and interact with in-game characters and starship systems.

## Natural language processing in Microsoft Azure

In Microsoft Azure, you can use the following Azure AI services to build natural language processing solutions:

| Service | Capabilities |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Azure AI Language** | Use this service to access features for understanding and analyzing text, training language models that can understand spoken or text-based commands, and building intelligent applications. |
| **Azure AI Translator** | Use this service to translate text between more than 60 languages.|
| **Azure AI Speech** | Use this service to recognize and synthesize speech, and to translate spoken languages.|
| **Azure AI Bot Service** | This service provides a platform for conversational AI, the capability of a software "agent" to participate in a conversation. Developers can use the *Bot Framework* to create a bot and manage it with Azure Bot Service - integrating back-end services like Language, and connecting to channels for web chat, email, Microsoft Teams, and others.|
