The principles of responsible AI can help you understand some of the challenges facing developers as they try to create ethical AI solutions. It's easy to read about the principles, or watch a video; but it's much harder to put the principles into practice.

## Try this

Here's an activity to help you learn more about how principles apply to an AI system that interacts with human users.

1. Open another browser tab and go to https://aidemos.microsoft.com/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/demo.
2. Select cards from each of the decks, which represent four phases in a Human-AI interaction:
    - Initially
    - During the interaction
    - When something goes wrong
    - Over time
3. For each card, view the examples provided.
4. Try to identify which of the six principles the examples reflect (an example might reflect more than one principle).
