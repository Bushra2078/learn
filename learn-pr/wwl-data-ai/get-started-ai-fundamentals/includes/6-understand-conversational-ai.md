Conversational AI is the term used to describe solutions where AI agents participate in conversations with humans. Most commonly, conversational AI solutions use *bots* to manage dialogs with users. These dialogs can take place through web site interfaces, email, social media platforms, messaging systems, phone calls, and other channels.

Bots can be the basis of AI solutions for:

- Customer support for products or services.
- Reservation systems for restaurants, airlines, cinemas, and other appointment based businesses.
- Health care consultations and self-diagnosis.
- Home automation and personal digital assistants.

View the following video for some examples of how organizations are using bots to enable conversational AI.

## Conversational AI in Microsoft Azure

To create conversational AI solutions on Microsoft Azure, you can use the following services:

| Service | Capabilities |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **QnA Maker** | This cognitive service enables you to quickly build a *knowledge base* of questions and answers that can form the basis of a dialog between a human and an AI agent.|
| **Azure Bot Service** | This service provides a platform for creating, publishing, and managing bots. Developers can use the *Bot Framework* to create a bot and manage it with Azure Bot Service - integrating back-end services like QnA Maker and LUIS, and connecting to channels for web chat, email, Microsoft Teams, and others.|
