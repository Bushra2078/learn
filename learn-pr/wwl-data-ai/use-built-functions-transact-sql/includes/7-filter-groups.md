When you have created groups with a GROUP BY clause, you can further filter the results. The HAVING clause acts as a filter on groups. This is similar to the way that the WHERE clause acts as a filter on rows returned by the FROM clause.

A HAVING clause enables you to create a search condition, conceptually similar to the predicate of a WHERE clause, which then tests each group returned by the GROUP BY clause.

The following example counts the orders for each customer, and filters the results to include only customers that have placed more than 10 orders:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID,
      COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

### Compare HAVING to WHERE

While both HAVING and WHERE clauses filter data, remember that WHERE operates on rows returned by the FROM clause. If a GROUP BY ... HAVING section exists in your query following a WHERE clause, the WHERE clause will filter rows before GROUP BY is processedâ€”potentially limiting the groups that can be created.

A HAVING clause is processed after GROUP BY and only operates on groups, not detail rows. To summarize:

 *  A WHERE clause filters rows before any groups are formed
 *  A HAVING clause filters entire groups, and usually looks at the results of an aggregation.
