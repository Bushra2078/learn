You've seen how you can use Transact-SQL to enable you to transform and group data, to represent it in different ways that will help you to meet your requirements. This is because you're able to use operators such as PIVOT, UNPIVOT, and subclauses such as CUBE, ROLLUP, and GROUPING SET to retrieve data in different orientations and groupings.

In this module, you've learned how to:

- Write queries that pivot and unpivot result sets.
- Write queries that specify multiple groups with GROUPING SET, CUBE, and ROLLUP.
