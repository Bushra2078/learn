You can use Transact-SQL to enable you to transform and group data. This way, you can represent it in different ways that will help you to meet your requirements. You're able to do this because you can use operators such as PIVOT, UNPIVOT, and subclauses such as CUBE, ROLLUP, and GROUPING SET to retrieve data in different orientations and groupings. In this module, you'll learn how to use these operators and subclauses in Transact-SQL.

After completing this module, you'll be able to: 

- Write queries that pivot and unpivot result sets.
- Write queries that specify multiple groups with GROUPING SET, CUBE, and ROLLUP.
