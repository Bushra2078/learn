The pre-built receipt model is a part of the Form Recognizer service.  It is optimized to extract information from receipts.  Capable of reading from restaurant, retail, and gas company receipts, it can help automate expense workflows for businesses by extracting key data from the receipts.

You can find out more about reading text with the Computer Vision service in the [service documentation](/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer?azure-portal=true).

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
