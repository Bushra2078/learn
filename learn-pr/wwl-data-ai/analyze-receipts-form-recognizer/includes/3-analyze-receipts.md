The best way to learn how to process receipts with the Form Recognizer service is to explore it for yourself.

## Before you start

[!INCLUDE [](../../includes/ai-fundamentals-lab.md)]

## Complete the exercise

After you have set up the Python environment and cloned the **ai-fundamentals** repository, you're ready to explore receipt analysis with Form Recognizer.

1. Open the **06 - Receipts with Form Recognizer.ipynb** notebook in the **mslearn-ai900** folder in Visual Studio Code.

2. Read the information in the notebook, and run the code cells it contains in order.

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
