The **Form Recognizer** service in Azure provides intelligent form processing capabilities that you can use to automate the processing of data in documents such as forms, invoices, and receipts. It combines state-of-the-art optical character recognition (OCR) with predictive models that can interpret form data by:

- Matching field names to values.
- Processing tables of data.
- Identifying specific types of field, such as dates, telephone numbers, addresses, totals, and others.

Form Recognizer supports automated document processing through:

- **Custom models**, which enable you to extract what are known as key/value pairs and table data from forms.  Custom models are trained using your own data, which helps to tailor this model to your specific forms.  Staring with only five samples of your forms, you can train the custom model.  After the first training exercise, you can evaluate the results and consider if you need to add more samples and re train.
- **A pre-built receipt model** that is provided out-of-the-box, and is trained to recognize and extract data from sales receipts.

## Azure resources for Form Recognizer

To use the Form recognizer service, you must create a **Form Recognizer** resource in your Azure subscription.

After the resource has been created, you can create client applications that use its **key** and **endpoint** to connect submit forms for analysis.

## Using the pre-built receipt model

Currently the pre-built receipt model is designed to recognize common receipts, in English, that are common to the USA.  Examples are receipts used at restaurants, retail locations, and gas stations. The model is able to extract key information from the receipt slip:

- time of transaction
- date of transaction
- merchant information
- taxes paid
- receipt totals
- other pertinent information that may be present on the receipt
- all text on the receipt is recognized and returned as well

The pre-built receipt model does specify input requirements. Adherence to the following input criteria will yield the best results when using the model.

- Images must be JPEG, PNG, BMP, PDF, or TIFF formats
- File size must be less than 20 MB
- Image size between 50 x 50 pixels and 10000 x 10000 pixels
- For PDF documents, no larger than 17 inches x 17 inches

There is a free tier subscription plan for the receipt model along with paid subscriptions.  For the free tier, only the first 200 pages will be processed when passing in PDF or TIFF formatted documents.
