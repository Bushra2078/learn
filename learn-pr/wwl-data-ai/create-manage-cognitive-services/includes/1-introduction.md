**Azure AI Services** are cloud-based services that encapsulate AI capabilities. Rather than a single product, you should think of Azure AI Services as a set of individual services that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications.

Azure AI services include a wide range of individual AI services across multiple categories, as shown in the following table.

| Natural language processing | Knowledge mining and document intelligence | Computer vision | Decision support | Generative AI |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| Text analysis             | Cognitive Search             | Image analysis                |  Anomaly detection | Azure OpenAI Service |
| Question answering        | Document Intelligence        | Video analysis                | Content moderation | DALL-E image generation |
| Language understanding    | Custom Document Intelligence | Image classification          | Content personalization | |
| Translation               | Custom skills                | Object detection              | | | 
| Named entity recognition  |                              | Facial analysis               | | |
| Custom text classification|                              | Optical character recognition | | |
| Speech                    |                              | Azure AI Video Indexer        | | |
| Speech Translation        |                              |                               | | |

While the details of each Azure AI service can vary, the approach to provisioning and consuming them is generally the same.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Provision Azure AI service resources in an Azure subscription.
- Identify endpoints, keys, and locations required to consume an Azure AI service resource.
- Use a REST API to consume an Azure AI service.
- Use an SDK to consume an Azure AI service.
