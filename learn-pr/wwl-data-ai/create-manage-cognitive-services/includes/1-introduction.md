**Azure Cognitive Services** are cloud-based services that encapsulate AI capabilities. Rather than a single product, you should think of Azure Cognitive Services as a set of individual services that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications.

Cognitive services offer a wide range of prebuilt AI capabilities across multiple categories, as shown in the following table.

| Language | Speech | Vision | Decision |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Text Analytics | Speech to Text | Computer Vision |  Anomaly Detector |
| Translator | Text to Speech | Video Indexer | Content Moderator |
| QnA Maker | Speech Translation | Custom Vision | Personalizer |
| Language Understanding | Speaker Recognition | Face | |
| | | | |

While the details of each cognitive service can vary, the approach to provisioning and consuming them is generally the same.
