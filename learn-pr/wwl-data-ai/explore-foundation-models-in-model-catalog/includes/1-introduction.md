**Foundation models**, such as GPT-3, are state-of-the-art natural language processing models designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language. To understand the significance of foundation models, it's essential to explore their origins, which stem from advancements in the fields of **artificial intelligence** and **natural language processing**.

## Understand artificial intelligence

1. The purpose of **artificial intelligence** is for computers or machines to perform tasks with human-like intelligence. 
1. A popular approach nowadays to approach artificial intelligence is through **machine learning**, a subfield that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
1. The subfield of **deep learning** uses artificial neural networks to learn and represent complex patterns and hierarchies from data, which are especially useful for data like images and text.

## Understand natural language processing

Foundation models use deep learning techniques and these pretrained **Large Language Models** (**LLMs**) are primarily designed for natural language processing tasks. Some common natural language processing use cases are:

1. **Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion**. For example, generate subtitles for videos.
1. **Machine translation**. For example, translate text from English to Japanese.
1. **Text classification**. For example, label an email as spam or not spam.
1. **Entity extraction**. For example, extract keywords or names from a document.
1. **Question answering**. For example, provide answers to questions like "What is the capital of France?"
1. **Text summarization**. For example, generate a short one-paragraph summary from a multi-page document.

In this module, you learn how developments in artificial intelligence and natural language processing have led to LLMs and foundation models. You explore and use foundation models in the model catalog, available in Azure Machine Learning.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Understand the developments that have led to foundation models.
- Explore the different types of foundation models available in the model catalog.
