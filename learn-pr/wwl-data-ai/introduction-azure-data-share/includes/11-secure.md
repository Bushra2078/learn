Security is a significant concern to many data providers and consumers. 

Azure Data Share leverages the security that Azure offers in relation to the protection of data at rest and in transit. 

Data that is shared or received is encrypted at rest; if it is supported by the underlying datastore. For example, if you share a dataset from an Azure Data Lake storage, it be encrypted at rest and in transit since Azure Data Lake Storage supports data encrypted at rest and in transit.  

You can set Access Control on the Azure Data Share resource level to make sure that only the people who are authorized are able to access it. In addition to that, Azure Data Share uses managed identity to access data stores in which the data resides for the use of data sharing. The reason why it is easy to configure a data share is because there is no need to exchange credentials between you as data provider, or you as a data consumer. 

For business continuity for Azure Data Share, it might be worth configuring a disaster recovery environment for Azure Data Share. Even though Azure data center outages are rare, it could cause disruptions in environments where there is dependency for data being shared by provider as well as consumer. As a data provider, you can have a data share environment provisioned in a secondary region to make sure that in case such an event occurs, there will be a smooth failover. 

The data share resources that can be configured are shares and datasets that exist in the primary Azure Data Share resource. Your data consumers are still able to get access to the data that you shared if you invite them to the secondary shares once youâ€™ve configured the Disaster Recovery environment in which snapshots schedules can still be enabled as part of failover (an active share subscription that is idle for Disaster Recovery. If the data consumer does not want to subscribe to the secondary region, you could invite them later as part of a manual failover step.
