Now  that you know what Azure Data Share is, let’s explore some common use cases:

*	Share data cross organizations
*	Share data on behalf of customers
*	Outsource analytical datasets 
*	Outsource AI
*	Data consortium specific to an industry
*	Data monetization and marketplace scenarios


>[!NOTE]
>To use Azure Data Share, both data provider and data consumer must have Azure subscriptions.  

These use cases can apply to different industries in which Azure Data share can be used. Let's look at a few examples in more detail.

An example of an industry is a food delivery service that needs to share ratings data with their partner restaurants. This relates to the use case of sharing data on behalf of customers. 

Another use case can include governments or research institutions that want to share statistics around population and health. In this use case, Azure Data Share could be used to share that data with third parties as a data marketplace.

An example of the AI outsourcing use case is a weather collection data agency that doesn't have in-house expertise in AI, so they outsource and share the data to a third-party specialized in building AI models. In return, the third party provides predictions and insights based on the data that they've shared. 

Now that you understand the common use cases, in the next unit let’s provision Azure Data Share.
