The key strategic asset that many organizations are focused on today is data, and there is a need to share or receive this in a safe and secure way with third parties, whether that is between departments within the organization, or externally with customers and partners. 

Many examples in which data sharing is often set up by these organizations is through the sending of emails that include attached excel files, or by building external APIs, and in some cases, configuring access to databases, just to name a few. 

The challenges that lie in these types of setup’s are in the monitoring, updating, maintaining, as well as securing these data sharing and receiving relationships. Sharing and receiving data through setting up APIs, is sometimes considered an expensive solution, and if large-scale data sharing is required, it is associated with a high management overhead. 

Azure Data Share, might be the answer to your solution, as it enables your organization to share data with or receive data in a secure and simple way. As a data provider, you can share data, stay in control and can manage and monitor the data that you have shared. You can also manage when you share data, and with whom you’ve shared it with.

As a Data Provider using Azure Data Share, you handle and control the terms of use for the data shared, as well as the frequency that data consumers receive updates.  You have the option to share from various data sources such as Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 1 and Gen 2, Azure Synapse Analytics and many more.  

A scenario for your organization to share data could be the outsourcing of AI datasets to a third party based on data you have collected.  Azure Data Share enables you to share these datasets in an easy, flexible, secure way to the organization that will provide these insights.  The third party you have shared your data with, can in response share their own AI insights back to you such that you can continue building new pipelines and add onto the insights that were created by the third party.
