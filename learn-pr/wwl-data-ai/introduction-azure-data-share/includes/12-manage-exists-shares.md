Situations for Managing existing Azure Data shares are when you want to send datasets to more people or organizations and adding or removing datasets. 

The way you can add recipients to an existing data share, is when you navigate to the sent share and select the invitations tab. 

You can click ‘+Add Recipient’ and specify the recipient that also needs to gain access to that existing share. 

If you want to add datasets to an existing share, where recipients might need to gain access to other datasets as well, you can add a dataset to the share such that you don’t have to set up a new data share. 

If you have recipients that, for example, no longer work for the company you shared your data with, you would need to revoke their access if they have already accepted the invitation. 
If the person did not accept the invitation, a simple delete of the invitation to a recipient will prevent the recipient from creating the share subscription and won’t receive any data that otherwise would have been shared. 
However, if the consumer already accepted the invitation, as mentioned before, you would have to revoke their access to the share subscription. 

If you revoke the share subscription access from the consumers, you prevent the consumer from triggering snapshots. However, if the consumer previously has performed a snapshot, the latest data that they have will stay in their account.
