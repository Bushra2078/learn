Use MLflow when submitting jobs with the CLI (v2) to track and manage models in Azure Machine Learning.

You're a data scientist at a company that sells bikes. The marketing department has asked you to train a model that will predict which customer will churn. Using that information, the marketing team will send out emails with special offers to avoid a customer from churning.

You use historical customer data to train a customer churn model. You are still in the experimentation phase and are training different models, varying the input.

To track the input and output for each model, and keep an overview of your work, you want to track model metrics. The model's output will allow you to easily share the model with the marketing team, once you have decided which model performs best.

This module shows you how to track models using MLflow. Using the tracked model's output, you'll be able to register a model with the CLI (v2) in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Track model parameters, metrics, and artifacts with MLflow
- Use MLflow model assets to register a model in the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
