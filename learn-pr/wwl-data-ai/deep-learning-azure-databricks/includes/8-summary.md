Deep learning is a powerful technique that you can use to train sophisticated machine learning models. Azure Databricks provides a suitable platform for deep learning model training because of its scalability and ability to work with large volumes of data in a data lake.

You can use any deep learning library that runs in PySpark, including PyTorch and TensorFlow; and you can distribute training tasks for these frameworks across cluster nodes by using Horovod.
