The most common (and most effective) method for tuning T-SQL queries is to evaluate and adjust your indexing strategy. Properly indexed databases perform fewer IOs to return query results, which reduces pressure on IO and storage, and even allows for better memory utilization. It is also important to keep in mind the read/write ratio of your queries. A heavy write workload may indicate that the cost of writing rows to additional indexes is not of much benefit. An exception would be if the workload performs mainly update operations which also need to do lookup, in which case additional indexes or columns added to an existing index may be beneficial. Your goal should always be to get the most benefit out of the smallest number of indexes on your tables.

A common performance tuning approach is as follows:

1. Evaluate existing index usage using sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats and sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats.
2. Consider eliminating unused and duplicate indexes---this should be done carefully, as some indexes may only be used during monthly/quarterly/annual operations, and may be important for those processes. You may also consider creating indexes to support those operations just before the operations are scheduled, to reduce the overhead of having otherwise unused indexes on a table.
3. Review and evaluate expensive queries from the Query Store, or Extended Events capture, and work to manually craft indexes to better serve those queries.
4. Create the index(s) in a non-production environment, and test query execution and performance and observe performance changes. It is important to note any hardware differences between your production and non-production environments, as the amount of memory and the number of CPUs could impact your execution plan.
5. After testing carefully, implement the changes to your production system.

You should also verify the column order of your indexesâ€”the leading column drives column statistics and usually determines whether the optimizer will choose the index. Ideally, the leading column will be selective and used in the WHERE clause of many of your queries. This is a good use of a change control process for tracking changes that could impact application performance. Finally, before dropping indexes, save the code in your source control, so the index can be quickly recreated in the event that an infrequently run query requires the index to perform well.
