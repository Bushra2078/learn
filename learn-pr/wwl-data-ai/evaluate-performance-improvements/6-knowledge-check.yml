  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What type of index is best used on a data warehouse fact table?"
    choices:
    - content: "Clustered Columnstore"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A clustered columnstore index will provide the best performance for a data warehouse fact table."
    - content: "Nonclustered Columnstore"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Nonclustered columnstore indexes will consume unnecessary space."
    - content: "Clustered b-tree"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A b-tree index will not match the performance of a columnstore index for scan operations."
  - content: "Which DMV provides information about server level wait statistics?"
    choices:
    - content: "sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This view shows fragmentation for indexes."
    - content: "sys.dm_os_wait_stats"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This shows the wait stats across the server."
    - content: "sys.dm_exec_session_wait_stats"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This DMV shows waits for a given session, but not across sessions."
  - content: "Which DMV can you use to capture the last Actual Execution Plan for a given query?"
    choices:
    - content: "sys.dm_exec_cached_plans"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This DMV has the information needed to retrieve the plan from cache."
    - content: "sys.dm_exec_query_plan"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This DMV just has the estimated execution plans that are in the plan cache."
    - content: "sys.dm_exec_query_plan_stats"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In SQL Server 2019 you can query sys.dm_exec_query_plan_stats to get the last actual execution plan for a query."
