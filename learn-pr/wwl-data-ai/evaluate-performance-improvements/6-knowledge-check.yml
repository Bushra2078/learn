quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What type of database design should you use for a data warehouse when you want to reduce the data volume of your dimensions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Snowflake schema"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Snowflake schema would reduce the data volume."
    - content: "Star Schema"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Star schema would increase the size of your data volume."
    - content: "3rd normal form"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. 3rd normal form would not be a good fit for a data warehouse structure."
  - content: "What is the minimum number rows do you need to bulk insert into a columnstore index?"
    choices:
    - content: "102,400"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. 102,400 is the minimum number of rows to bulk insert into a columnstore index, fewer rows will use a normal insert operation."
    - content: "1,000,000"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While this row count would be bulk inserted it is well above the minimum."
    - content: "1000"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This row count would not be bulk loaded."
  - content: "Which compression type offers the highest level of compression?"
    choices:
    - content: "Columnstore Archival"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Columnstore archival provides the highest level of compression in SQL Server."
    - content: "Page Compression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Page compression, while compressing more than row compression will not compress more than columnstore archival."
    - content: "Row Compression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Row compression will not deduplicate data which means it has a lower rate of compression."
