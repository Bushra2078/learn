The futurist and novelist Arthur C Clarke is often quoted as observing that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". While advancements in artificial intelligence may seem like magic, it is possible to understand how the magician is working, so to speak. In this module, we explore the development of generative AI, a branch of artificial intelligence, and how its advancements can assist humans with a variety of tasks.

Generative AI creates new content based on natural language input. Behind the increasingly amazing generative AI technologies we have today and will see tomorrow, lies a long history of human ingenuity and endeavor. Examining this history can provide a context for generative AI and enable you to gain at least a high-level understanding and appreciation of how the magic trick is done. 

In this module, you learn about some of the core concepts related to large language models and common uses of generative AI. You also learn how generative AI is being integrated into Microsoft technologies to power a new generation of intelligent applications.
