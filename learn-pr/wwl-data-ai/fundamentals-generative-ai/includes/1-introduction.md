Standard introduction unit – what we’re going to cover and why it’s important. Something like: 

Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence in which machine learning models can create new content based on natural language input. The models used to implement generative AI are trained with huge volumes of textual data and are referred to as large language models (LLMs). The large volume of training data and the neural network architecture used to train LLMs results in a model that can generate human-like natural language responses or even original images based on what it has learned about the structure and semantic meaning of language. 


## Example scenarios


## What will we be doing?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to: 

In this module, you’ll learn about some of the core concepts related to large language models and some common uses of generative AI. You’ll also learn how generative AI is being integrated into Microsoft technologies to power a new generation of intelligent applications.
