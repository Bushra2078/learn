Generative AI, and technologies that implement it like ChatGPT are increasingly in the public consciousness – even among people who don’t work in technology roles or have a background in computer science or machine learning.  The futurist and novelist Arthur C Clarke is often quoted as observing that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic", and in the case of generative AI there does indeed seem to be an almost miraculous ability to produce human-like original content, including poetry, prose, and even computer code.

However,  there’s no wizardry involved in generative AI – just the application of mathematical techniques that have been incrementally discovered and refined over many years of research into statistics, data science, and machine learning. This fact should in no way diminish the impressive capabilities of generative AI or leave us in any less wonderment at the possibilities it enables for us as a society; but it may help reassure us that behind the increasingly amazing generative AI technologies we have today and will see tomorrow, are some core concepts and principles that enable you to gain at least a high-level understanding and appreciation of how the magic trick is done.
