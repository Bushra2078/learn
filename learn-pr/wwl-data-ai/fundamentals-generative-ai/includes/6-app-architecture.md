Intelligent applications are software programs that complete tasks using AI. It is helpful to think of how the creation of a language model is related the process of creating an application that consumers use. When we discuss large language models we can think of this process: 

- A large amount of data is used to train a large language model 
- The model that is ready to return responses is known as pre-trained. Pre-trained models are also known as base or foundation models.  
- Services such as Azure OpenAI make pre-trained models available for engineers to use "off the shelf".
- Engineers can take the pre-trained model and customize is or leave it as is.
- Engineers deploy the model, which enables them to use the models in applications
- Engineers write other code, possibly to create a front and back end to an intelligent application. At this stage, engineers can also give the application specific instructions for what to do with prompts. 
- Consumers interact with the intelligent application by typing in a prompt.
