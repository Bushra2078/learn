In this module, you have learned about generative AI, a branch of artificial intelligence that creates new content based on natural language input. Generative AI is typically built into software applications and uses language models trained with huge volumes of textual data to generate human-like natural language responses or even original images. You have also learned about the core concepts related to large language models and common uses of generative AI, as well as how generative AI is being integrated into Microsoft technologies to power a new generation of intelligent applications.

The main takeaways from this module are that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work by assisting with first drafts, information synthesis, and strategic planning. Copilots, which are AI-powered assistants based on large language models, can be customized for a variety of business-specific applications and services. The quality of responses that a generative AI application returns not only depends on the model itself but also on the types of prompts it is given. Prompt engineering is the process of improving prompts to produce better results.
