Commonly used LLMs in Microsoft generative AI technologies: 

GPT 3 models for text and code-generation 

GPT 4 models – next generation GPT optimized for chat interactions 

DALL-E for image generation (based on GPT, but designed to generate image data) 

The GPT-3 model contains 175B parameters (weights). GPT-4 contains trillions.  

Make the point that these models are developed by OpenAI, a company that partners closely with Microsoft to develop LLMs and other AI solutions – best known as the company behind ChatGPT (which is an AI chatbot app based on a GPT LLM)
