Azure OpenAI Service is Microsoft's cloud solution for deploying, customizing, and hosting large language models. It brings together the best of OpenAI's cutting edge models and APIs with the security and scalability of the Azure cloud platform.

Models supported include: 

- Codex
- GPT 3 model families (Ada – Davinci) 
- GPT 3.5 Turbo (the original Chat GPT model) 
- GPT 4 - the evolution of GPT as a model that is optimized for chat-based interactions. 
- DALL-E – A model that generates graphical output from natural language input 

In many cases, models can be used as-is. For example, in Azure OpenAI Service, you can deploy a GPT-4 model and immediately start using it from an application. However, you can also use an existing model as a foundational model - a starting point for further training with your own data. This approach is called fine-tuning, and it enables you to train a custom model that builds on the pre-trained model, but which is tuned to data that is relevant for your particular scenario. For example, a legal firm might fine-tune a model with the text from existing contracts and other proprietary legal documents to train a model that is optimized for generating contractual content.

Developers can work with these models in Azure OpenAI Studio, a web-based environment where AI professionals can deploy, test, and manage LLMs that support generative AI app development on Azure. Within Azure OpenAI Studio, you can deploy large language models and test them in Azure OpenAI Studio's Chat playground.
