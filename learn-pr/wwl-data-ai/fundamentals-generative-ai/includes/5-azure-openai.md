Azure OpenAI Service is Microsoft's cloud solution for deploying, customizing, and hosting large language models. It brings together the best of OpenAI's cutting edge models and APIs with the security and scalability of the Azure cloud platform. 

Models supported include: 

- GPT 3 model families (Ada – Davinci) 
- GPT 3.5 Turbo (the original Chat GPT model) 
- GPT 4 - the evolution of GPT as a model that is optimized for chat-based interactions. 
- DALL-E – A model that generates graphical output from natural language input 

Developers can work with these models in Azure OpenAI Studio, a web-based environment where AI professionals can deploy, test, and manage LLMs that support generative AI app development on Azure.
