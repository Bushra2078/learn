Artificial Intelligence (AI) imitates human behavior by using machine learning to interact with the environment and execute tasks without explicit directions on what to output.

*Generative* AI describes a category of capabilities within AI that create original content. People typically interact with generative AI that has been built into chat applications. One popular example of such an application is [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt), a chatbot created by OpenAI, an AI research company that partners closely with Microsoft.

Generative AI applications take in natural language input, and return appropriate responses in a variety of formats such as natural language, images, or code. 

## Natural language generation

To generate a natural language response, you might submit a request such as *"Give me three ideas for a healthy breakfast including peppers."*

A generative AI application might respond to such a request like this:

*OK, here are three suggested healthy breakfasts that include peppers:*

*1. Egg and Pepper Scramble: Dice up some bell peppers and sauté them in a pan until they're slightly softened. Then, add in some beaten eggs and scramble everything together. Serve with whole-grain toast for a nutritious breakfast.*

*2. Pepper and Avocado Toast: Toast a slice of whole-grain bread and top it with sliced bell peppers, mashed avocado, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. This is a great way to get some healthy fats from the avocado along with the vitamin C from the peppers.*
  
*3. Breakfast Burrito with Peppers: Sauté some diced bell peppers, onions, and scrambled eggs together in a pan. Then, spoon the mixture onto a whole-grain tortilla and top with some salsa or hot sauce. Roll it up and enjoy a satisfying and nutritious breakfast.*

## Image generation

Some generative AI applications can interpret a natural language request and generate an appropriate image. For example, you might submit a request like *"Create an image of an elephant eating a burger"*.

A generative AI application could then return an original new image based on the description you provided, like this:



|Generate code | "Show me how to code a game of tic-tac-toe with Python" | `Code` | 

Developers build generative AI applications like ChatGPT with large language models which are trained on massive volumes of text data. The sheer volume of training data and the way large language models are designed results in models that can generate human-like natural language responses or even original images based on what it has learned about the structure and semantic meaning of language. 

Consider these scenarios where a software application helps you by producing: 

- A bulleted list comparison between two types of cooking ingredients 
- A birthday card image based on your description
- Several suggested ways to start coding a solution to a programming problem 

The application's responses often appear like the model understands our prompts because of language modeling. Getting to know how generative AI's language modeling works can give you a greater ability to apply its capabilities with confidence. Next we will take a look at how language models have evolved.
