AI-powered assistants based on LLMs that work alongside you to dramatically increase productivity and extend your capabilities. 

Examples: 

Bing / Edge copilot: Provides AI help when browsing or searching the Internet by generating natural language answers to questions based on context rather than just search results of indexed pages. 

M365 copilot: works alongside you in productivity and communication apps, assisting you in creating effective documents, spreadsheets, presentations, emails, and other ways. 

GitHub copilot: Provides support to software developers, helping them write, document, and test code.  

Based on a common architecture, so developers can build custom copilots for business-specific applications and services. 

Extensible through plug-ins, that can add a specific context layer to prompts and “ground” the responses returned by LLMs. For example, the prompt “Tell me about Edinburgh” to an LLM might result in historic, cultural, and geographical information about Edinburgh. A plug-in for a travel company might provide additional context data that enables the response to include details of hotels in Edinburgh.
