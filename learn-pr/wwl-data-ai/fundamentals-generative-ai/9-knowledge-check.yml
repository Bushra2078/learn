  questions:
  - content: "What are Large Language Models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Models that only work with one language."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Large language models can work with multiple languages."
    - content: "Models that only work with small amounts of data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Large language models work with massive amounts of data."
    - content: "Models that use deep learning to process and understand natural language on a massive scale."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Large language models use deep learning to process and understand natural language on a massive scale."
  - content: "What is an example of a potential task a generative AI application can help solve?"
    choices:
    - content: "Monitoring the temperature in a manufacturing facility."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Anomaly detection is an AI task, but not a generative AI task."
    - content: "Generating new protein sequences that aid in drug discovery for patients with rare diseases."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Producing new suggestions for protein sequences is a generative AI task."
    - content: "Collecting real time data and storing it in a database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Real-time data can be used to support AI tasks, but the storage of real-time data is not in itself a generative AI task."
  - content: "What is the purpose of assigning vectors to each word during the training process of a Large Language Model?"
    choices:
    - content: "To represent semantic meaning by the distance between vectors."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The vectors for each word are assigned during training so that the representation for each token consists of multiple numeric elements. Each element indicates the location of the word along a particular dimension, like coordinates on a map."
    - content: "To assign a unique number to each word in the corpus, or body of text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would not capture the relationship between words."
    - content: "To identify the most common words in the corpus, or body of text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would not capture the relationship between words."
  - content: "What is the potential impact of copilots?"
    choices:
    - content: "Copilots only impact applications used in professional settings."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Copilots can be built for a multitude of applications that are used at work and in day-to-day life."
    - content: "Using generative AI, copilots can help with first drafts, information synthesis, strategic planning, and much more."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Copilots have the potential to revolutionize the way we work"
    - content: "Copilots can only be used for certain natural language tasks like summarizing text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Copilots can be built on large language models that have a multitude of capabilities, from text to code to image generation and beyond."
