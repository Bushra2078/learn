Delta Lake is an increasingly used technology for large-scale data analytics where you need to combine the flexibility and scalability of a data lake with the transactional consistency and structure of a relational database.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Describe core features and capabilities of Delta Lake.
- Create and use Delta Lake tables in a Synapse Analytics Spark pool.
- Create Spark catalog tables for Delta Lake data.
- Use Delta Lake tables for streaming data.
- Query Delta Lake tables from a Synapse Analytics SQL pool.

To learn more about using Delta Lake in Azure Synapse Analytics, see [Linux Foundation Delta Lake overview](/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-delta-lake-overview) in the Azure Synapse Analytics documentation.
