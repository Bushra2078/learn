Now let's build an application that uses Azure OpenAI models. In this exercise, you deploy an Azure OpenAI model and generate responses from then with the SDK. You get a chance to see how different parameters are passed with the request, how to include the library, and how to request a generated response.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete this lab, you will need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) and you need to be approved for Azure OpenAI access. If you need access, apply at the [Azure OpenAI limited access](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?azure-portal=true) page.
