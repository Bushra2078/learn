AOAI offers a REST API for interacting and generating responses that developers can use to add AI functionality to their applications. This unit covers example usage, input and output from the API.

> [!NOTE]
> Before interacting with the API, you must create an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal, deploy a model in that resource, and retrieve your endpoint and keys. Check out the [Getting started with Azure OpenAI Service](/training/modules/get-started-openai/) to learn how to do that.

For each call you need the endpoint and a key from your Azure OpenAI resource, as well as the name you gave for your deployed model. In the following examples, the following placeholders are used:

|Placeholder name | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| `YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME` | This is found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section in the Azure portal. It is the base endpoint of your resource, such as `https://sample.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `YOUR_API_KEY` | This is found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section in the Azure portal. You can use either key for your resource. |
| `YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | This is the name provided when you deployed your model in the Azure OpenAI Studio. |

## Completions

Once you have deployed a model in your AOAI resource, you can send a prompt to the service using a `POST` request. The most common endpoint is `completions`, which will generate the completion of your prompt.

```rest
curl https://YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/completions?api-version=2022-12-01\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d "{
  \"prompt\": \"Your favorite Shakespeare is\",
  \"max_tokens\": 5
}"
```

The response from the API will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "id": "<id>",
    "object": "text_completion",
    "created": 1679001781,
    "model": "text-davinci-003",
    "choices": [
        {
            "text": "Macbeth",
            "index": 0,
            "logprobs": null,
            "finish_reason": "stop"
        }
    ]
}
```

The completion response to look for is within `choices[].text`. Notice that also included in the response is `finish_reason`, which in this example is `stop`. Other possibilities for `finish_reason` include `length`, which means it used up the `max_tokens` specified in the request, or `content_filter`, which means the system detected harmful content was generated from the prompt. If harmful content is included in the prompt, the API request will return an error.

## Chat completions

Similar to `completions`, `chat/completions` generates a completion to your prompt, but works best when that prompt is a chat exchange.

```rest
curl https://YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/chat/completions?api-version=2023-03-15-preview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant, teaching people about AI."},
{"role": "user", "content": "Does Azure OpenAI support multiple languages?"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, Azure OpenAI supports several languages, and can translate between them."},
{"role": "user", "content": "Do other Azure Cognitive Services support translation too?"}]}'
```

The response from the API will be similar to the following:

```json
{
    "id": "chatcmpl-6v7mkQj980V1yBec6ETrKPRqFjNw9",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1679001781,
    "model": "gpt-35-turbo",
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 95,
        "completion_tokens": 84,
        "total_tokens": 179
    },
    "choices": [
        {
            "message":
                {
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": "Yes, other Azure Cognitive Services also support translation. Azure Cognitive Services offer translation between multiple languages for text, documents, or custom translation through Azure Cognitive Services Translator."
                },
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "index": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

Both completion endpoints allow for specifying other optional input parameters, such as `temperature`, `max_tokens` and more. If you'd like to include those in your request, add them to the input data with the request.

## Embeddings

Embeddings are helpful for specific formats that are easily consumed by machine learning models. To generate embeddings from the input text, `POST` a request to the `embeddings` endpoint.

```rest
curl https://YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/embeddings?api-version=2022-12-01 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"input\": \"The food was delicious and the waiter...\"}"
```

When generating embeddings, be sure to use a model in AOAI meant for embeddings. Those models start with `text-embedding` or `text-similarity`, depending on what functionality you're looking for.

The response from the API will be similar to the following:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "embedding",
      "embedding": [
        0.0172990688066482523,
        -0.0291879814639389515,
        ....
        0.0134544348834753042,
      ],
      "index": 0
    }
  ],
  "model": "text-embedding-ada:002"
}
```
