MapReduce is a data-parallel framework, originally created by Google<sup>[1][^1]</sup>, for processing big-data applications on large suites of computers. The system attempts to decrease interprocess communication by moving computation toward data. It also transparently tolerates data and computation faults, both highly probable in large-scale cloud settings. Developers, consequently, recognize MapReduce for its scalability, fault tolerance, and elasticity. Now, there are many implemetations of the MapReduce programming model availible to users on the cloud, many of which rely on Apache Hadoop.

Since its debut, MapReduce has been frequently associated with Hadoop,<sup>[3][^3], [4][^4]</sup> an open-source implementation of MapReduce. Academic, government, and industrial use of Hadoop is growing rapidly.<sup>[2][^2]</sup> For instance, Yahoo! uses it for around 80% to 90% of its jobs<sup>[5][^5]</sup>. Others, such as Facebook and Microsoft, have also advocated for the framework.<sup>[6][^6]</sup> Academia currently uses Hadoop for seismic simulation, natural-language processing, and web data mining, among other applications.<sup>[7][^7], [8][^8]</sup>

Hadoop MapReduce performs most of the labor involved in implementing cloud programs through three main strategies:

- It automatically breaks down jobs into distributed tasks to effectively exploit task parallelism.
- It considers data locality and variations in overall system workloads to schedule jobs and tasks efficiently at participating cluster nodes.
- It transparently tolerates both data and task failures.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:
- Identify the underlying distributed programming model of MapReduce
- Explain how MapReduce can exploit data parallelism
- Identify the input and output of map and reduce tasks
- Define task elasticity, and indicate its importance for effective job scheduling
- Explain the map and reduce task-scheduling strategies in Hadoop MapReduce
- List the elements of the YARN architecture, and identify the role of each element
- Summarize the lifecycle of a MapReduce job in YARN
- Compare and contrast the architectures and the resource allocators of YARN and the previous Hadoop MapReduce
- Indicate how job and task scheduling differ in YARN as opposed to the previous Hadoop MapReduce
