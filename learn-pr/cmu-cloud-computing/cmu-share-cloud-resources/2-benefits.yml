# Four questions from Learn by Doing block
# Hint text not ported over
  - content: "If one of the major objectives of public clouds is to leverage datacenter (shared) resources to provide on-demand elasticity, can public clouds be built without using virtualization?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! It is hard to build public clouds without using virtualization, but certain specialized hardware, operating systems, and software can be incorporated to deliver on-demand scalability."
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Public clouds can be built without using virtualization. It is hard to build public clouds without using virtualization, but certain specialized hardware, operating systems, and software can be incorporated to deliver on-demand scalability."

  - content: "To remain competitive, enterprises often are forced to use the latest technologies for their private clouds. However, the process of incorporating a new system, or even of migrating to a new system, is tedious and expensive. For instance, new versions of software must be thoroughly tested in a production-like environment before they can replace older versions. Virtualization facilitates the process by allowing the testing and verification of software to proceed in partitions that are separated from ones that execute production processes. Which characteristics of virtualization facilitate such a process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sandboxing and heterogeneity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sandboxing and a mixed-OS environment facilitate the process. Heterogeneity does not facilitate the process. Heterogeneity is a property that typically is offered by the underlying infrastructure, and is imposed by heterogeneous workloads (i.e., workloads with various resource demands). Specifically, heterogeneity applies to computer hardware, the OS, programming languages, and implementations of software by different developers."
    - content: "Sandboxing and a mixed-OS environment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Sandboxing, heterogeneity, and a mixed-OS environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sandboxing and a mixed-OS environment facilitate the process. Heterogeneity does not facilitate the process. Heterogeneity is a property that typically is offered by the underlying infrastructure, and is imposed by heterogeneous workloads (i.e., workloads with various resource demands). Specifically, heterogeneity applies to computer hardware, the OS, programming languages, and implementations of software by different developers."
    - content: "Sandboxing, elasticity, and a mixed-OS environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sandboxing and a mixed-OS environment facilitate the process. Elasticity enables the addition or removal of resources to respond to application load."
    
  - content: "Which of the following is <b>not</b> an advantage of virtualization?"
    choices:
    - content: "Facilitating research"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtualization can help facilitate research in various ways, such as logging events, making it possible to dump machine state and replay saved execution sequences."
    - content: "Sharing resources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtualization aids in effective system utilization by effectively sharing resources. "
    - content: "Improving performance"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Virtualization actually adds overhead to performance because of the additional layer of hypervisor between the virtual machine and the hardware."

  - content: "What does virtualization provide to make it difficult for one cloud user to observe or alter another's data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Server consolidation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Consolidating servers means that virtualization allows the creation of more virtual machines on fewer physical machines."
    - content: "Fault containment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Fault containment is an advantage of resource sandboxing that ensures that a software failure in one application running on one virtual machine cannot affect applications running on other virtual machines."      
    - content: "Resource sandboxing"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A sandbox means an isolated environment. Virtualization makes is possible to create multiple isolated environments on a single physical machine in which each environment is secure and unaffected by other environments."
