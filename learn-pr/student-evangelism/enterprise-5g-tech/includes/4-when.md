The choice of when to use 5G and Azure private MEC depends on various considerations. Below, we outline some of the options you need to consider in your decision-making process
Core value proposition.

The core value proposition for 5G and Azure private MEC depends on the following primary criteria:

- Your service needs high bandwidth
- Your service needs low latency
- You probably need a high density of sensor deployment
- You're deploying complex IoT Edge applications or Live Video analytics applications
- You need to integrate your 5G service into your broader Azure ecosystem to provide an end-to-end service
- You want to develop using familiar Azure toolsets

## Technology choices

Having addressed the core value proposition, you need to make several technology choices as the next step in your deployment.

**Edge devices v.s. Datacenter?**

Will you be deploying on edge devices or a data center? If you're deploying on an edge device, you should consider Azure Stack Edge. If you're deploying on a data center, you should consider Azure Stack HCI. In both cases, you will avail of the same toolsets to deploy and manage your application. 

**End to end deployment considerations**

To deploy your service end to end, you need to consider some additional Azure tools. These include Azure IoT Edge Runtime, Azure IoT Hub, Azure IoT Central, Azure Digital Twins, Azure Video Analyzer, Media service storage, so on.

**What components will you use to manage your deployment?**

Once you deploy your application, how will you manage it on a day-to-day basis? Here, you have a few choices, such as the Azure network functions manager and Azure enabled Kubernetes. 

**Mobile network or systems integrator considerations**

Typically, you deploy new 5G based services as a partnership between an enterprise, a network operator, and a systems integrator. Participants in the collaborative 5G ecosystem will avail of various benefits as part of their value proposition. For example, if you're a mobile network provider or a systems integrator, you could access fusion core and Affirmed Private Network Service (APNS) through the marketplace. 

## Application areas

The primary defining characteristics of 5G applications are High bandwidth (video), IoT Edge analytics, and sensor density. As we have seen previously, we have seen that these characteristics are applicable for the health monitoring of dementia patients. You could also apply 5G and Azure Private MEC to other areas, including:

- **Manufacturing â€“** for Real-time automation, especially in Robotics.
- **Smart spaces -** Digital kiosks and signage connected to real-time events and information in airports or stadiums.
- **Transportation -** Improved efficiencies for the turnaround of airplanes.
- **Public safety and health -** Near real-time data capabilities for safety and to improve passenger flow.
- **Retail -** Identification of out-of-stock items
- **Infrastructure -** Early infrastructure deterioration protection and predictive maintenance for critical infrastructure.
