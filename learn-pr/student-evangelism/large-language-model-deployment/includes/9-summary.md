In this module, you first learned about the Azure OpenAI cloud resource. The Cloud resource is something you need to have to use an LLM in the cloud.

Next, you explored deployments. A deployment is done on a specific model you want to use. Once a model is deployed on your cloud resource youâ€™re able to use it.

Key takeaways from this module:

- Azure OpenAI Service is a managed service that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language generative AI models. These models include ChatGPT and GPT-4 from OpenAI alongside the security and enterprise promise of Azure.
- Azure OpenAI Service provides a simple REST API for accessing these models.

Finally, you learned to verify your deployment by using Azure OpenAI Studio. You verified it by trying out various prompts that not only showed the deployment was successful but also showed some capabilities the LLM can perform without the need for further training.
