To use a large language model (LLM), you can run it locally or through a cloud provider, like Azure. The benefits of using a cloud-hosted version are that the provider guarantees that the model works. If you're building a tech startup or adding a large language model to an existing product, you can foster customer trust via guaranteed performance. Additionally, when you run an LLM through a cloud provider, you don't need to worry about the data leaking, because your data is protected. 

## Scenario: Trying out an LLM for a tech MVP

Imagine you run a tourism tech startup and want to use an LLM for various tasks to run your business more efficiently and to offer a better customer experience. Before you choose to use an LLM, you want to test it out to see if it provides useful responses. You also want to ensure that whatever prompts the LLM is given are secure between you and your cloud provider. You imagine there should be some sort of testing playground to explore these concerns.

## What will you learn?

In this module, you'll learn to:

- Provision an Azure OpenAI cloud resource.
- Create a deployment for a specific LLM model.
- Experiment with different prompts to see what type of results an LLM can give in different situations.

## What is the main objective?

Provision and use a large language model deployment in Azure OpenAI Studio.
