Playgrounds are useful interfaces in Azure OpenAI Studio that you can use to experiment with your deployed models without needing to develop your own client application.

## Completions playground

The Completions playground allows you to make calls to your deployed models through a text-in/text-out interface and adjust parameters. You need to select the deployment name of your model under Deployments. Optionally, you can use the provided examples to get you started, and then you can enter your own prompts.

## LLMs' capabilities

An LLM has built-in capabilities that you can use without training it further. LLMs can therefore do more than just generating new words, they're also capable of the following behavior:

- **Extracting information**: You can provide an LLM with some text and ask it to extract specific pieces of information from that text. For example, if you provide the LLM with this text:

  *"Hello, my name is Robert Smith"*

  Ask it to *extract the person's name* from this text and it returns:

  *"Robert Smith"*

- **Changing the format of content**: You can provide an LLM with some text and ask it to summarize it by using a specific format. For example, if you provide the LLM with this text:

  *"I like the following colors: red, green, and yellow. I also like the following food: macaroni, cheese, and honey"*

  Ask it to summarize what you like in a table or JSON format and it returns:

  `{ "colors": ["red", "green", "yellow"], "food": ["macaroni", "cheese", "honey"] }`

- **Classifying content**: You can provide an LLM with some text and ask it to classify the content to different known categories or even give it your own categories. For example, if you provide the LLM with this text:

  *"I loved your product it really helped me do what I wanted"*

  Ask it whether this text was negative or positive and it returns:

  "positive"

- **Summarizing content**: You can provide an LLM with lots of text and ask it to summarize it for you. For example, if you provide the LLM with this text:

  *"Hey James, I had a fun last weekend with you we spend lots of time playing on the beach. Letâ€™s do that again soon! bye"*

  Ask it to summarize what the person wants from you and it returns:

  "The person is asking James to spend time with them again soon"

- **Generating novel content**: You can ask an LLM to generate new content about nearly anything you could think of. For example, if you ask the LLM to write a haiku about happiness it returns:

  "The sun sets gently
  Warm breeze whispers through the trees
  Peaceful, happy heart"
