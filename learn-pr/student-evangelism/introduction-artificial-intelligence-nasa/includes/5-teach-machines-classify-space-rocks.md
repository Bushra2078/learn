The job of the AI scientist in creating an AI model is to teach the computer to complete three steps. Let's walk through the three steps in the example of training a computer to predict types of rocks in random photos of rocks.

### Step 0

A preparatory step is to import image data and the libraries that help process them on the computer you're training. The computer transforms the images to matrixes of number so that the images are in a format the computer can read.

### Step 1

In photos of rocks that we'll examine, the computer extracts features like texture, size, color, and edges. Scientists use intuition and experience to choose which features to use.

### Step 2

The computer makes associations between image features and types of rock. Computers can be better than humans at the task of detecting minute details because there are so many associations to make.

The computer builds a network that's capable of keeping track of millions of associations.

### Step 3

Given a new photo of a rock, the computer extracts features in the photo, and then uses associations between existing data and the new photo to predict the type of rock it is.
