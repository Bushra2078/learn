Over the course of the project, we'll be using the followinig libraries listed. The libraries are free, and they are commonly used in real-life AI projects. These libraries are just a few of the many libraries that you can use to create an AI program. To learn about other common AI libraries and what they do, see [Top 8 Python libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence](https://hackernoon.com/top-8-python-libraries-for-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence-y08id3031?azure-portal=true).

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib primarily is used to visualize data in Python. You can use Matplotlib to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib is useful for showing your data in a more visual way.

## NumPy

NumPy, short for *Numerical Python*, is a popular library used for organizing and storing data in Python. You can use NumPy to create structures for holding data called arrays. Like lists, arrays store many types of data. NumPy has many functions that are helpful for manipulating data in arrays.

## PyTorch

PyTorch, a machine learning library, has many built-in functions to help accelerate building projects. PyTorch primarily is used to modify data in an existing machine learning program.
