As we complete the learning path, we'll be using the following libraries. The libraries are free, and they are commonly used in real-life AI projects. These libraries are just a few of the many libraries you can use to create an AI model. To learn about other common AI libraries and what they do, see [Top 8 Python libraries for machine learning and artificial intelligence](https://hackernoon.com/top-8-python-libraries-for-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence-y08id3031?azure-portal=true).

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib primarily is used to visualize data in Python. You can use Matplotlib to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib is useful for displaying your data in a more visual way.

## NumPy

NumPy, short for *Numerical Python*, is a popular library that's used to organize and store data in Python. You can use NumPy to create structures that hold sets of data called *arrays*. Like lists, arrays store many types of data. NumPy has many functions that are helpful for manipulating data in arrays.

## PyTorch

PyTorch, a machine learning library, has many built-in functions to help accelerate building projects. PyTorch primarily is used to modify data in an existing machine learning program.
