In this lesson, you learned more about space rocks and AI.

- You studied the differences between *basalt* and *highland* rock, and learned how distinguishing characteristics, or *features*, help to form classifications.

- You considered the steps humans follow to examine and classify objects, and then reviewed how we can teach machines to classify objects by following a similar process.

- You learned about different Python libraries for AI, including Matplotlib, NumPy, and PyTorch.

- You used Anaconda to download the Python libraries to your computer, and installed them in preparation for building an AI model.
