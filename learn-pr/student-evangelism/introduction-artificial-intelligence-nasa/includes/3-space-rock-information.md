Before we learn the details of how AI can be used to classify rocks, let's start by learning about the different types of rocks that we'll be working with. And, we'll see how well *you* do at classifying rocks.

## Types of rocks

In this lesson, we'll classifying photos of rocks into one of two types: basalt and crustal.

> [!NOTE]
> These rock types are also found on Earth, but for this lesson, we are looking onlyat the lunar variants; that is, rocks that are from the moon.

Basalt is a dark rock that comes from ancient volcanic eruptions on the Earth's moon. When you look up at the moon and see dark spots and patches, you likely are seeing basalt rock on the moon's surface. Nearly 26% of the near side of the moon is basalt; only 2% of the far side is basalt. Most basalt in either of the moon's hemispheres is found in areas of low elevation. Basalt is especially common in the very large impact basins across the surface of the moon.

Crustal is a lighter rock that forms after a partial melt of mantle rocks. Crustal is less common than basalt.

Look carefully at the sample images for each rock type to learn how to classify a new rock that just arrived from the moon.

What type of rock do you think this newly arrived rock is?

This new rock that we just received is a basalt rock. Did you get it right?

Notice how it's very hard to classify this rock because it looks both like crustal and basalt rock. Computers are great at finding the smaller details that the human eye can miss. This is how artificial intelligence can assist us.
