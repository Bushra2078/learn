Before we learn the details of how AI can be used to classify rocks, let's start by learning about the different types of rocks that we'll be working with. And, we'll see how well *you* do at classifying rocks.

## Types of rocks

In this lesson, we'll classify photos of rocks into one of two types: basalt and highland (also known as crustal).

> [!NOTE]
> These rock types also are found on Earth, but for this lesson, we are looking only at the lunar variants; that is, rocks that are from the Moon.

Basalt is a dark rock that comes from ancient volcanic eruptions on the Earth's Moon. When you look up at the Moon and see dark spots and patches, you likely are seeing basalt rock on the Moon's surface. Nearly 17% of the near side of the Moon is basalt; only 2% of the far side is basalt. Most basalt in either of the Moon's hemispheres is found in basins or large craters.

Highland rocks are lighter than basalts due to the heavier elements in basalts (e.g., Fe, Mg). But they were made when a large magma ocean, that covered the entire Moon when it was forming, crystallized and because the highland rocks are lighter they floated to the top and became the crust of the Moon.

Look carefully at the sample images for each rock type to learn how to classify a new rock that just arrived from the Moon.

What type of rock do you think this newly arrived rock is?

The new rock is a basalt rock. Did you get it right?

Notice how it's very hard to classify this rock because it looks both like highland and basalt rock. Computers are great at finding the smaller details that the human eye can miss. This is how artificial intelligence can assist us.
