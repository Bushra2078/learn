AI is a fairly new but prominent topic in the field of computer science, and more specifically, data science. The main concept of AI is teaching a computer how to learn things, and then make basic decisions based on what it has learned.

Although you might think that teaching computers how to "think" on their own would lead to extinction of the human race, computers need humans to program them. This means that there's no threat of computers taking over the world, but there are many benefits of programming computers to make decisions. AI is what Netflix uses to recommend what to watch next, it helps Siri better detect our phone use habits, and Tesla uses it to build driverless cars.

AI works by giving many different pieces of data to a computer, and then telling the computer what that data represents. We'll give a computer different images of space rocks and tell the computer what type of rock is in each image. For example, we will upload a photo of basalt rock to our computer and tell the computer that the photo is a photo of basalt rock. This is the process of building an AI *model*. You use a model to make predictions. After we show the computer a large number of images and create a model based on that data, we can give the computer a new picture that doesn't have a label, and the computer should be able to tell us what type of rock it is.

Finally, you might see the terms *machine learning* and *artificial intelligence* used almost interchangeably. The main difference between the two is that machine learning is a type of AI. They are very similar, but in this module, we will focus on AI.
