In this unit, you'll learn how to start programming the Altair emulator from CP/M.

## A bit about CP/M

For more information about CP/M, see [CP/M Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M?azure-portal=true).

CP/M, originally stood for Control Program/Monitor, then later became known as Control Program for Microcomputers. It was a mass-market operating system created in 1974 for Intel 8080/85-based microcomputers by Gary Kildall of Digital Research, Inc. The first version was single-tasking on 8-bit processors with support up to 64 kilobytes of memory. Later versions of CP/M added multi-user variations and were migrated to 16-bit processors.

## Programming option on CP/M

From CP/M you can start **MBASIC (Microsoft Basic)**, and write and save apps. For **C** and **Assembler** applications you can edit with the WordStar text editor.

In the following exercise, you'll learn how to start programming.
