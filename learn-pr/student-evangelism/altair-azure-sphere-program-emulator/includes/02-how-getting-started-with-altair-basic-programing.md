In this unit, you will learn how to program the Altair emulator using Altair BASIC.

## Overview

[Altair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC?azure-portal=true) was written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen and was the first Microsoft product. At the time, Altair BASIC was a huge step forward as it allowed people to write programs in a high-level language. Back then, BASIC was an easy language to learn and use, far easier than Assembler, and it is still in use today.

The [Altair 8800 BASIC Reference Manual](https://github.com/AzureSphereCloudEnabledAltair8800/Altair8800.manuals/blob/master/MITS_Altair8800Basic4.1Reference_April1977.pdf?azure-portal=true) is a great place to start to learn about the language.

In the following exercise, you learn how to start Altair BASIC and write your first Altair BASIC application.
