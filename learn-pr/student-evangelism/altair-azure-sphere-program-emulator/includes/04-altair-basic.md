This unit provides an overview of programming the Altair emulator with Altair BASIC.

Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote [Altair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC?azure-portal=true). It was Microsoft's first product. At the time, Altair BASIC was a huge step forward because it allowed people to write programs by using a high-level programming language.

The [Altair 8800 BASIC reference manual](https://github.com/AzureSphereCloudEnabledAltair8800/Altair8800.manuals/blob/master/MITS_Altair8800Basic4.1Reference_April1977.pdf?azure-portal=true) is a great place to start to learn about the language.

In the following exercise, you'll learn how to start Altair BASIC and write your first Altair BASIC application.
