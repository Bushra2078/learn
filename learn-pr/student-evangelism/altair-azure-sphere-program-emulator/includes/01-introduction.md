Welcome to the learning path for the cloud-connected Altair 8800 on Azure Sphere. In this module, you'll learn how to program the Altair 8800 emulator.

## Scenario: Programming

The Altair emulator is running an open-source Intel 8080 emulator. Layered on the Intel 8080 emulator is Altair BASIC and CP/M.

The Altair emulator can be programmed in two ways:

- Entering Intel 8080 [opcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode?azure-portal=true) by using the Altair front panel switches
- Using a higher-level programming language such as C or BASIC
