Welcome to the cloud-connected Altair 8800 on Azure Sphere learning path. In this module, you'll learn how to program the Altair 8800 emulator.

## Scenario: Programming

The Altair emulator is running an Open Source Intel 8080 emulator. Layered on the Intel 8080 emulator is Altair BASIC and CP/M.

The Altair Emulator can be programmed in two ways:

- Entering Intel 8080 [Opcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode?azure-portal=true) using the Altair front panel switches or,
- using a higher-level programming language such as C and BASIC.
