The original Altair 8800 was programmed directly on the front panel. It was a painstaking, error-prone process to load and run a program. The Altair 8800 had a series of LEDs and switches for loading apps and determining the state of the machine.

Programming the Altair emulator by using the front panel and Intel opcodes is a great way for you to understand how computers work. The Altair emulator supports the following options to program with the front panel:

- **Virtual front panel**: The advantage of the virtual front panel is that no extra hardware is required. It works with both the Avnet and Seeed Studio Azure Sphere developer kits.
- **MikroE 8800 Retro Click**: If you have an Avnet Azure Sphere Starter Kit, then the MikroE 8800 Retro Click front panel is an option to simulate the front panel. The advantage is a more authentic experience in programming the Altair. The LED panel also indicates the current state of the Altair and your application.
- **Altair front panel board**: The Altair front panel is the most authentic experience. You'll need to build it, but it operates just like the original Altair. You can find the hardware design in the [MT3620 Azure Sphere Based Altair 8800 Hardware](https://github.com/AzureSphereCloudEnabledAltair8800/AzureSphereAltair8800.Hardware?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) repository.
