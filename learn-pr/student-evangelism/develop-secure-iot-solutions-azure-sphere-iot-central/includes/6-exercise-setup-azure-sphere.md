## Enable Azure RTOS Real-time development

### Install and enable the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for Windows

1. Download the [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) for Windows.
2. Install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
3. Enable Real-time core development

   Open the **Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt** as administrator, run the following command to enable app development on the device.

   ```
   azsphere device enable-development -r
   ```

### Install and enable the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for Linux

Install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for Linux

1. Download the [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads?azure-portal=true). At the time of writing this was *Version 9-2020-q2-update*.
2. Install the downloaded package. The following installs the toolchain in the /opt directory.

    ```bash
    sudo tar -xjvf gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2 -C /opt
    ```

3. Update your path. Open ~/.bashrc and add to the end.

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update/bin
    ```

4. Enable Real-time core development

    Open the Linux **Terminal** and run the following command to enable app development on the device.

   ```bash
   azsphere device enable-development -r
   ```

## Clone the Azure Sphere Developer Learning Path

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, clone the *Azure Sphere Developer Learning Path* to a directory close to the root directory on your computer. For example, **c:\lab**, or **~/**. The reason is that the Azure Sphere build process uses CMake which can struggle with long path and directory names.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Azure-Sphere-Developer-Learning-Path.git Azure-Sphere
```

## Clone the Azure Sphere samples

The Azure Sphere samples repository includes a tool required for listing Azure IoT Central network endpoints.

Clone this repository into the same directory that you cloned the Azure Sphere Developer Learning Path into.

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples.git
```
