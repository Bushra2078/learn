## Step 1: Build and deploy your application

1. Start Visual Studio Code to open your project.

2. Click **Open folder**.

3. Open the Azure-Sphere lab folder.

4. Open the **Lab_3_Device_Twins** folder.

5. Click **Select Folder** or the **OK** button to open the project.

6. Set your developer board configuration

   1. Open CMakeList.txt
   2. Uncomment the **set** command that corresponds to your Azure Sphere developer board.
   3. Save the file. This will autogenerate the CMake cache.

7. Configure the Azure IoT Central connection information

   1. Open the **app_manifest.json** file.
   2. You'll need to redo the settings for the **app_manifest.json** file. Either copy from **Notepad** if you still have it open or copy from the **app_manifest.json** file you created in the previous exercise.
   3. Paste the contents of the clipboard into **app_manifest.json** and save the file.

8. Ensure main.c is open.

9. Select **CMake: [Debug]: Ready** from the Visual Studio Code Status Bar.

10. From Visual Studio Code, press F5 to build, deploy, start, and attached the remote debugger to the application now running the Azure Sphere device.

## Step 2: Expected Device Behavior

### Avnet Azure Sphere MT3620 Starter Kit

![The illustration shows Avnet Azure Sphere kit.](../media/avnet-azure-sphere.jpg)

1. The RGB LED5 will start to blink. In the next section, you'll be setting the desired temperature which will determine the RGB LED color.
2. LED4 will turn yellow when connected to Azure.
3. LED3 will blink when telemetry is sent to IoT Central
4. Press **Button A** or **Button B** on the device to change the blink rate of LED5 and to update the **Actual Temperature** Device twin property in IoT Central.

### Seeed Studio Azure Sphere MT3620 Development Kit

![The illustration shows Seeed Studio Azure Sphere kit.](../media/seeed-studio-azure-sphere-rdb.jpg)

1. The RGB LED 1 will start to blink. In the next section, you'll be setting the desired temperature which will determine the RGB LED color.
2. The network LED will turn red when connected to Azure.
3. LED 4 will blink blue when telemetry is sent to IoT Central
4. Press **Button A** or **Button B** on the device to change the blink rate of RGB LED 1 and to update the **Actual Temperature** Device twin property in IoT Central.

### Seeed Studio MT3620 Mini Dev Board

![The illustration shows Seeed Studio Mini Azure Sphere kit.](../media/seeed-studio-azure-sphere-mini.png)

1. The green LED closest to the USB connector will start to blink
2. Given this device has no builtin buttons then virtual **Button A** and **Button B** presses will be generated every 10 seconds. The blink rate will change and the **Actual Temperature** Device twin property in IoT Central will be updated.

------

## Step 3: Display the actual temperature property

1. Switch to Azure IoT Central in your browser.

2. Select the **Devices**, then the **Azure Sphere** template, then your device.

3. Select the **Form** tab.

4. Azure Sphere devices with builtin buttons, press **Button A** or **Button B** to update the **Actual Temperature** property in IoT Central.

   > Note, IoT Central does not update immediately, it might take a minute or two for the Actual Temperature property to change.

   Virtual button press events are generated for Azure Sphere devices that do not have builtin buttons.

## Step 4: Set the desired temperature

Setting the desired temperature is like setting a thermostat in a room. A desired temperature device twin property message is sent to the Azure Sphere where it will be acted upon.

When the temperature sensor is read on the Azure Sphere it is compared to the desired temperature.

- If the temperature is greater than the desired temperature the blinking LED will turn blue to indicate the cooler needs be turned on.
- If the temperature is less than the desired temperature then the blinking LED will turn red to indicate the heater needs to be turned on.
- If the temperature is the same as the desired temperature then the blinking LED turns green to indicate no action required.

> The AVNET Azure Sphere Starter Kit has a built-in temperature sensor. For other boards, a random temperature 25 +/- 5 degrees celsius is generated.

To set the desired temperature:

1. Update the **Desired Temperature** value.
2. Save the Property. This will send the desired temperature property to the Azure Sphere. The blinking LED color may change depending on the desired temperature chosen.
