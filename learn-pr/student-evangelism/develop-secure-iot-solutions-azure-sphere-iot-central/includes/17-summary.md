You run applications on the Azure Sphere to stream room environment data to the cloud to IoT Central. You monitored the data being sent from Azure IoT Central web portal. You were able to send commands from Azure IoT Central to the control the device.

We learnt that Azure Sphere is secure by default, with ongoing updates, and multiple layers of security. Azure Sphere protects our IoT devices, our networks, and our solutions, and it also helps to protect against software bugs and mistakes we make in our applications.

We also learnt that Azure Sphere is flexible and supports a wide range of application scenarios. Azure Sphere has three developer-accessible cores you can deploy your applications on. You can run less demanding high-level applications and simultaneously run   demanding, time sensitive real-time applications on the real-time Cortex-M4 cores.

IoT security was critical for this microbiology lab, without this Azure Sphere-based application, you would need to manually record room conditions at regular intervals. Any variation in the lab environment can't be detected in real time. Using this solution, you'll have the ability to produce accurate, stable, and secure results in near real time.
