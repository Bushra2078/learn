**Azure Health Bot Service** is a cloud platform that empowers developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy their compliant virtual health assistants and health bots, powered by AI, that help them improve processes and reduce costs.

The service combines built-in medical intelligence with natural language capabilities and more, allowing healthcare organizations to give people access to trusted and relevant healthcare services and information. Healthcare Organizations often have a wide range of users, and to meet their diverse expectations, the Health Bot Service simplifies the process of creating a health bot and integrating it with the existing systems in the organization that are accessed by the patients, nurses, doctors, and other representatives.

Additionally, to enhance the usability of the health bot, it can be given a personal touch by introducing custom scenarios into the health bot and integrating it with other IT systems and data sources. This gives the users a customized experience, each time they interact with the health bot.

Customers such as American Nurses Foundation and Health Service Executive (HSE) Ireland have been using Microsoft Health Bot Service to drive patient engagement in a variety of use cases.

Kate Judge, Executive Director of American Nurses Foundation shares with us:

“As part of our Well-Being Initiative, we created the Stress Self-Assessment tool using the Azure Health Bot. This tool offers an anonymous way for nurses to check on themselves and receive guidance to safeguard their well-being. The bot helps nurses discover and make use of a variety of evidence-based ways to build strength and maintain health, like peer support, guided relaxation, apps with well-being tools, and webinars.”  

Let’s learn more about the features that make the Azure Health Bot accommodating and adaptable for its users:

### Out-of-the-box AI and world knowledge capabilities

The Azure Health Bot has built-in interactive symptom checker and medical database, which combinedly enable meaningful conversations with patients using both common language and medical terms. The health bot instances handles interruptions, topic changes, human error and complex medical questions.  

### Configurable and extensible

Healthcare Organizations can flexibly extend a health bot instance to their own scenarios. Its behavior can be configured to match the partner's use cases, processes, and scenarios. The health bot instance can be connected to partners' information systems--for example, systems that manage EMR, health information, and customer information.  

### Security and privacy

The Azure architecture powers the Health Bot service's ability to scale with resilience, while maintaining the highest standards of [privacy and security](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/complianceofferings?product=Azure). This ensures that each health bot instance handles privacy protected and secure information.

### Easy to manage

Azure Health Bot Service’s management portal and management API manages each health bot instance, which is monitored by Microsoft partners. The management portal monitors usage while the management API allows secure exchange of data and information.
