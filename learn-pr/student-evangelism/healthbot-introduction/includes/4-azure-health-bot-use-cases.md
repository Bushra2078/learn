To determine if Health Bot is for you, let’s see some scenarios that you can use. The Health Bot contains built-in scenarios but you can also build additional scenarios through the Scenario Editor.

The built-in scenarios include the following:

#### 1. Triage/symptom checker, powered by built-in medical protocols

The end user describes a symptom to the health bot instance and the bot helps the user to understand it and suggests how to react; for example, "I have a headache".

#### 2. General information about conditions, symptoms, causes and complications

Loaded with medical content, the health bot instance can provide information about medical conditions, symptoms, causes, and complications; for example, "information about diabetes", "what are the causes of malaria" or "tell me about the complications of arthritis".

#### 3. Find doctor type

The health bot instance can recommend the appropriate type of doctor to treat an illness; for example, "What type of doctor treats diabetes?".

If you would like to build something more detailed that meets your expectations, below are some examples of scenarios that are typically built by our customers as extensions using the scenario authoring elements:

- **Health plan inquiries**: Your health bot instance can be customized to access information about health plan details, such as pricing and benefits

- **Finding providers**: Your health bot instance can allow customers to search for doctors by specialty, in-network status, and other specifications

- **Scheduling appointments**: Your health bot instance can be designed to allow your customers to schedule appointments easily and securely

Now, let’s examine how two different kinds of companies can use the Health Bot Service:

1. Insurance companies can build health bot instances that give their customers an easy way to look up the status of a claim and ask questions about benefits and services. Through this interaction, customers acquire better communication with the company and the company itself understands the existing needs.

2. Providers can build health bot instances that triage patient issues with a symptom checker, help patients find appropriate care, and look up nearby doctors. In this way, patients have an integrated solution which helps them in everyday healthcare issues.
