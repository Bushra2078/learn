In contrast to the Bot Framework, the Health Bot simplifies the process of creating a bot that addresses the compliance and regulatory requirements of the healthcare industry. It does so by providing:

### An extensible management portal

Each health bot instance is managed and monitored via the Health Bot Service's management portal and management API. The management portal provides the ability to define the health bot instance's behavior in fine detail and to monitor usage with built-in reports. Management API allows you to embed the health bot instances and to securely exchange data and information.

You can use the endless flexibility of the service as shown in the examples below:

- Unique scenarios can be authored by you for your health bot instances to extend the baseline scenarios and support your own flows

- The health bot instance's behavior can be configured to match your scenarios

- The health bot instance can be connected to other information systems---for example, systems that manage EMR, health information, and customer information

- The health bot instance can be integrated into other systems such as web sites, chat channels, and digital personal assistants

### Integration with Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) and other cognitive services

The Health Bot implements natural language understanding (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to understand the users' intent and provide accurate information. In this way, users interact with the chat bot via text or voice in a self-service manner. The next module of the learning path will explain more on that.

### Built in triage and symptom checker

An interactive symptom checker and medical database are built in to the Health Bot. Together, they enable meaningful conversations with patients using both common language and medical terms. Conversational intelligence also adapts dynamically as the health bot instance learns from previous interactions. The service intelligence is powered by Azure Cognitive Services and credible world knowledge. Besides the built-in scenarios, developers can build custom scenarios that meet their business needs and expectations.  

### Healthcare-specific configuration options

Health Bot should meet the regulatory requirements of the healthcare industry so it's important to refer to some issues of Trust and Compliance. The information handled by each instance of the Health Bot Service is privacy protected to HIPAA standards and secured to the highest standards for privacy and security by Microsoft. HIPAA is the acronym for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act which mandates industry-wide standards for health care information on electronic billing and other processes and also requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information.

Built on top of the industry-leading Microsoft Azure technology, the Azure architecture powers the Health Bot Service's ability to scale with resilience, while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security.

The Health Bot has a list of certifications that can be found in the [official documentation](/healthbot/) in the category Trust and Compliance.
