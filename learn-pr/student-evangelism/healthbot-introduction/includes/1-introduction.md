Bots allow customers to interact with different computer applications using text or speech. It may be a simple conversation or a more complicated one where different technologies and systems are integrated to deliver the desired result.

The Azure Health Bot Service empowers healthcare organizations to build and deploy an AI-powered conversational healthcare experience at scale. Its built-in medical database differentiates the Health Bot service from the Bot Framework and gives developers the chance to use built in scenarios or create custom scenarios to meet their business needs. The service intelligence is powered by Azure Cognitive Services and credible world knowledge.

In addition to that, the information handled by each instance of the Health Bot Service is privacy protected to HIPAA standards and secured to the highest standards of privacy and security by Microsoft.

In this module, you will take a look at Azure Health Bot and its capabilities. Youâ€™ll then learn how businesses can use the service to build powerful health bots. No prior knowledge is required so if you're a beginner this module will get you going. If you know how a Health Bot works, this module will tie concepts together and fill in the gaps.
