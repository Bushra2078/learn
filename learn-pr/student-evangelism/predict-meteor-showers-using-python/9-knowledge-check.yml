  questions:
  - content: "How often do meteor showers happen?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only when Earth aligns with certain planets or moons."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Earth's location in its orbit matters in relation to meteor showers. But alignment with other planets or moons doesn't affect meteor showers."
    - content: "Meteor showers originate from Mars, which has about a two-year orbit around the sun."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Meteor showers originate from debris left by comets, asteroids, and sometimes planets or moons. But they don't depend on planetary orbits."
    - content: "Only once every two years."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Debris is always being brought into our atmosphere. Most of it burns before it passes through the atmosphere."
    - content: "Every 76 years, when the Halley comet orbits near the sun."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Debris from the Halley comet is left behind every 76 years. But that debris can enter our atmosphere every time we pass its location in space."
  - content: "Where can you find meteorites on Earth?"
    choices:
    - content: "Antarctica"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's typically easier to spot meteorites in Antarctica because of the high-contrast black rocks on white ice. But meteorites also can be found in other places."
    - content: "The desert"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's typically easier to spot meteorites in the desert because of the high-contrast black rocks on light sand. But meteorites also can be found in other places."
    - content: "Your backyard"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's typically extremely difficult to spot meteorites in your backyard because of the rocks and other debris scattered around. But meteorites can be found here and elsewhere as well."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes, meteorites can land anywhere on Earth. It's just much harder to find them when there is low contrast between the meteorites and their surroundings."
  - content: "What would the following code return?
      `some_return_value = friends.loc[(friends['location'] == my_location) & (friends['hunger'] >= my_hunger), 'favorite_food'].tolist()`"
    choices:
    - content: "A list of all of the favorite foods of my friends who were with me and who were at least as hungry as I was."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This code first grabs the rows where your friends were with you and were at least as hungry as you were. Then it grabs the favorite_foods column and creates a list."
    - content: "A list of my friends, sorted from least hungry to most hungry, who were with me and had the same favorite food as me."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This code looks for friends who were with you and who were at least as hungry as you. But it doesn't return a list of friends."
    - content: "A list of the locations of my friends who were at least as hungry as I was and who had a favorite food."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This code looks for friends who were with you and who were at least as hungry as you. But it doesn't return a list of locations."
    - content: "A list of all of my friends who were with me, who were at least as hungry as I was, and who had the same favorite food as me. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This code looks for friends who were with you and who were at least as hungry as you. But it doesn't return a list of friends."
