The stories of stars flying through out night skies have been passed down through all cultures and families and through thousands of years. Each intepretation of our participation in this vast universe provides us with an inspirational lens to view new challenges and solutions. 

The story of Fei Fei and Chang'e is no different. Over the Moon delivers a brilliant narrative to events that happen in every night in our shared sky. While we cannot predict the mood of Chang'e, we can begin to feel closer to the celestial events through what we do know. 

While the lists and notifications of meteor showers and other space events may seem common place in a world full of apps and websites, the data that goes behind these predictions is still very complex. In this module, we've only begun to tap into the beginning of how we can accurately predict where and when a meteor shower can be viewed.
