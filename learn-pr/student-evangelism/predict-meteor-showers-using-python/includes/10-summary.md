Stories of stars flying through night skies have been passed down through cultures and families for thousands of years. Each interpretation of our part in this vast universe provides us with an inspirational lens to view new challenges and solutions. 

The story of Fei Fei and Chang'e is no different. *Over the Moon* delivers a brilliant narrative of events that happen every night in our shared sky. Although we can't predict the mood of Chang'e, or know whether we're really looking at flying frogs, we can feel closer to celestial events through what we know.

Although lists of meteor showers and other space events may seem commonplace in a world full of apps and websites, the data behind these predictions is complex. In this module, we've only begun to address how to accurately predict where and when a meteor shower can be viewed. 

You're now equipped to gather data on other celestial (or earthly) events and to explore that data through code to gain understanding and new perspectives. This module is a first step to creating models that computers can run on their own to make predictions. It all starts with one person's curiosity. 

This module is part of a multimodal learning experience. [Follow along with a video walkthrough of the module in a new tab](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG?azure-portal=true).
