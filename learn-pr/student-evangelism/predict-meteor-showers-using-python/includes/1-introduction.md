[Over the Moon](https://www.netflix.com/title/80214236?azure-portal=true) is a beautifully crafted story of how a girl named Fei Fei builds and flies a rocket ship to meet the moon goddess, Chang'e. This film ignites curiosity about who we are in relation to the rest of our universe.

This film, along with the real-life ingenuity of space exploration, inspired this module. Looking into the night sky and seeing stars, planets, and meteor showers can often kindle a scientific and imaginative curiosity about our universe. On one hand, you might feel awe about what we've collectively been able to *know* about the universe, thanks to the scientists, engineers, and astronauts that have built upon collective knowledge for hundreds of years. On the other hand, you might feel a unworldly wonder about the stories we've each heard about what causes meteor showers or who lives on the moon. These perspectives often drive each other. New scientific discoveries create new narratives for films, and fiction provides us with the creativity to solve real problems in new ways.

This module focuses on a real-world event, meteor showers. It guides you to use data science to predict the best day to see a meteor shower in your general location. Just like Fei Fei, you will hone new skills, develop persistence, and be inspired by the story to build something that brings you closer to the universe. 

This module is a part of a multimodal approach to learning, meaning that you can also follow along with a video tutorial in the [Learn with Dr. G video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG).

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will begin to discover: 

- The basics of meteor showers: what they are and why we see them.
