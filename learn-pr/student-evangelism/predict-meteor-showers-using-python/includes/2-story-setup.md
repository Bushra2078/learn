In Over the Moon Film, Fei Fei's mother tells her the story of Chang'e, the moon goodess who tried to escape with the love of her life, but ended up living an eternal life alone on the moon after. Fei Fei and her mother gaze into the clear night sky as her mother tells Fei Fei that Chang'e's tears turn to star dust and is what we can see flying across our skies every night. 

This moment is not only a touching moment, but also what inspired this particular module. When Fei Fei and her parents are looking into the night sky, they are likely watching meteoroids flying through out atmosphere towards our Earth. While Fei Fei might need to know the mood of Chang'e to know if there will be a major meteor shower event, we can also rely on events that we can measure to predict when we will be able to see a meteor shower. And at the end of the module, we can add in what we know about Chang'e to add to our data predictions!

Before getting started, it's important to understand what meteor showers are. This will help us understand what data we should gather to write our algorithm to predict the best meteor shower viewing date. 

## What Are Meteor Showers?

Meteoroids are objects in space that are typically made of dust, rocks, or metal. They can range from small grains of dust to small asteroids. They are essentially space rocks floating out in space. When meteoroids get near Earth they are pulled into our atmosphere by gravity. As they enter the astmosphere, they begin to burn, which is the light that we see in our skies and they are called meteors during this state. If the meteor passes through the atmosphere without completely burning, it will land somewhere on Earth and is then called a meteorite. 

NASA estimates that 48.5 tons of meteoric material falls to Earth each day, most of which are completely burned by our atmosphere. For the ones that make it to our surface, the best places to find them would be in the desert or an icy place like Antartica. This is mainly because by the time they land on Earth, they look pretty similar to any rock you'd find in your yard, so it's difficult to notice them compared to someting naturally occuring on Earth. 

Meteoroids can originate from comets, asteroids, moons, or other planets. The most likely source to cause a meteor shower (when a lot of meteors can be seen at once) is from comets, so this module will focus on those. 

You can learn more about meteors and meteor showers on the [NASA Solar System website](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/overview).

### Meteors from Comets 

Comets are mostly made of ice with some dust, rock, and metals embedded in them. They have cylindrical orbits around our sun, meaning sometimes they are nearer. During the times when a comet is near the sun, they will often begin to melt. As the comet melts, parts of the dust, rock, and metal will dislodge from the comet and remain in space at that location. 

When earth nears the orbit of the comet, the debris that was left from the comet when it orbited that same location last will enter our atmosphere. Since there is a high likelihood of a lot of debris being left by the comet at that location, there is a high likelihood of enough meteors to enter our atmosphere, causing a meteor shower. 

*Fun Fact*: There is a high likelihood that Earth's oceans were caused by enough comets hitting Earth during the formation of our planet, with the ice from the comets melting and creating our oceans!
