  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "The Custom Vision service requires a significant amount of code to use."
    choices:
    - content: "True. To use the Custom Vision service on Azure, you need to write an entire artificial intelligence algorithm."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. You can write code to call the Custom Vision service, but the AI algorithm is a part of the service and not something you have to write."
    - content: "True. You can only call the Custom Vision service from C# code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. You can call the Custom Vision service from C# code, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Python, and you can also use the browser portal."
    - content: "False. It only takes 50 lines of code to use the Custom Vision Service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. You can use the Custom Vision service in about 50 lines of code, but you can also use the portal and not write any code."
    - content: "False. There is a browser option where you can use it without any code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct. While calling the Custom Vision service with C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Python is an option, it is not required."
  - content: "How many images do you need, at a minimum, to use to train the Custom Vision service to identify an object in an image?"
    choices:
    - content: "1,000"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The more images you have to train your AI the better, but you do not *need* 1,000 images to get started with the Custom Vision service."
    - content: "1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You need more than one image to train the Custom Vision service AI on a tagged object."
    - content: "15"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You need at least 15 images per tag to have the Custom Vision service be able to train to identify that object."
    - content: "100"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The more images you have to train your AI the better, but you do not *need* 100 images to get started with the Custom Vision service."
  - content: "If you are using cloud resources in the East US Region to train your Custom Vision model, which region do you need to provision resources to run the predictions?"
    choices:
    - content: "East US"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You could choose East US, but you do not have to."
    - content: "West US 2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You could choose West US 2, but you do not have to."
    - content: "East US 2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You could choose East US 2, but you do not have to."
    - content: "Any available region"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can choose any region that supports Custom Vision, but it's best to choose the region closest to where the majority of predictions will be made."
