##  Module Review
After evaluating the Train Custom Vision AI learn module, these are recommendations on how the module can be improved.  The feedback is based on best practices provided in [Contribute to Learn](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/contribute-to-learn/?branch=master) mondule and metrics gathered from Gold Stardard: https://mslearnmetricportal.azurewebsites.net/.

## Areas of Improvement
The following are areas that need improvement:

| Topic | Category | Feedback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intro | Instructional Design  | Intro does not have problem statement or a challenge Custom Vision is solving.  Missing statement of what Custom Vision service does or why readers should use it.<br>Too much emphasis on discussing "Over the Moon" movie plot which most readers may not have watched.<br>*Suggestion*:  Talk about how users can use Custom Vision to identify unique cartoon characters from a movies. Example.  Bungee vs Jade the bunny; or any bunny cartoon character that looks like Bungee. |
| Exercise | Instructional Design | No sample data provided for readers to understand what's going on.  No way for user to replicate or follow what is being instructed.<br>Users have to sign-up for Azure, create a resource group, before the conceptual context of what the reader will be doing in the lab was introduced.<br>*Suggestion*:  Create screenshots of scenes with Bungee in the movie. Provide a GitHub link for users to access the sample data.  Check copyright rules for this.   If there are copyright violations in providing sample images, then display screenshots of the 15 images you uploaded in the Learn module. That way the user can see what you did to get the prediction scoring from Custom Vision. |
| Conceptual content | Content deviation | Several references to other learn modules or resource which is distracting and out of scope for this module. Pricing, SDKs, modules.<br>Too much emphasis on discussing the "Over the Moon" movie which most readers may not have watched. <br>Ethics was listed as an objective for the module, but there was no illustration or explanation of why AI for Good applies to contents of this learn module.<br>Images too large and overbearing.  Reduce number of images. |
| Summary | Instructional Design | Summary was a recap of the lessons learned from the movie. However, it had nothing to do with Custom Vision. |
| Time | Instructional Design | 32 minutes (recommend 18 minutes)  |
| Units | Instructional Design | 9 units (recommend 5 units)  |
| Image | Instructional Design | 27 images |
