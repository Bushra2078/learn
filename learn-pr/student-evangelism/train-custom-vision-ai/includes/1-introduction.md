Resourceful and Creative. Fei Fei, the protagonist in the new movie [Over the Moon](https://www.netflix.com/title/80214236) (on Netflix October 23, 2020), exhibits resourcefulness and creativity as she seeks to help her father remember the story of Chang'e and everlasting true love. In the film, Fei Fei uses her STEM skills, determination, and passion to fly to the Moon, and it's her friends, and the love they have for her, that helps her get home. 

While Fei Fei didn't jump into AI during her journey to the moon, her dedication was certainly inspired by wanting to help people, in particular, her family. As she struggles to make sense of love, life, and the legends she heard as a child, she creates a way to address her problems head on, with the help of her buddy Bungee of course.

In the film, Fei Fei and Bungee arrive on the Moon. Throughout their adventures, Fei Fei arrives back at the wreckage from her ship that landed a bit aggressively to the surface. At this point, we get a cameo from the Lunar Rover!

This cameo, along with the themes from the film, are what inspired this module:

Imagine Fei Fei was able to re-program the Lunar Rover, who's off taking pictures and beaming them down to Earth for NASA scientists to research, to look for her friend Bungee and send those images to *her* instead of NASA. You could imagine this also helping pet owners being able to get good pictures of their pets sent directly to their phones while they are away from home!

In this module, you will choose an animal, could be your pet, and you will train a custom vision AI to be able to identify your pet in an image. All without needing to know how to code!

Remember, hile you can use technical skills to build almost anything, the ultimate goal should always be to help people. Designing technology to help people is something Microsoft is passionate about, *especially* when it applies to artificial intelligence. We focus on [AI for Good](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-good) and want to encourage you to start your AI journey always thinking about how you can help improve our world.
