# Summary

As we all navigate this ever growing field of technology and innovation, it is up to us to identify opportunities to be creative. Each of us has had a unique journey that has given us a lens through which we can see challenges that need addressing and unique solutions for them. 

Fei Fei has shown us that through passion and love you can achieve more than you thought was possible, you can literally fly over the moon. But she also taught us that solutions require determination and resilience too. As you continue on your journey through learning to code, learning how to leverage AI, or learning about the role data plays in our world, remember that it is your responsibility to bring your whole self and to recognize your impact.

The next time you are looking up at the Moon, think about the inspiration not only from Over the Moon and Fei Fei, but from the non-fictional humans who have stepped foot on it. Think about the dedication Fei Fei had and how similar it was to the dedication that NASA had when they sent the Apollo 11 crew to land on the Moon for the first time in human history. What we can imagine from stories, we can turn into reality through collaboration, hard work, and a bit of creativity. 

In this module, you began to explore the world of AI through the lens of a beautifully drawn story. You learned a bit about how AIs work, and the ethics behind using them to impact our world and societies. With these skills and inspiration, you should feel confident to continue exploring, learning, and failing forward towards making an impact that is meaningful to you!

Keep hold of your wonder!
