In the film, Fei Fei and Bungee not only build the rocket together, but Bungee is right there next to Fei Fei as they fly to the Moon.

You might recall from the film, Bungee and Fei Fei separate from each other as Fei Fei ventures back to the wreckage of her rocket to 
look for something for Chang'e. When she arrives back at the wreckage we get a cameo from the Lunar Rover!

This cameo, along with the themes from the film, are what inspired this module:

Imagine Fei Fei was able to re-program the Lunar Rover to help her with her own mission. THe Lunar Rover is off taking pictures and beaming them down to Earth for NASA scientists to research, but what if Fei Fei could add just a bit of AI to the rover so that if it ever found Bungee hoping around the surface, it would snap a picture of her and re-direct that picture to Fei Fei instead of NASA! This could be useful while Fei Fei and Bungee are both on the Moon, but could also be useful if Bungee wanted to take a vacation to the Moon to be with Jack Rabbit! You could imagine Bungee posing in front of the Lunar Rover knowing that it would send picture updates to Fei Fei on Earth.

Beyond the narrative of the film, you could imagine this also helping pet owners here on Earth (with their pets on Earth too). Imagine if you could have a camera that was trained to take periodic pictures of your backyard, and anytime your pet was in the picture, it would send you a text with the picture! You might finall be able to get good pictures of your pet without having to fumble with your phone! 

Some of the best pictures are unplanned moments, and this kind of AI-enabled camera could really capture those moments!
