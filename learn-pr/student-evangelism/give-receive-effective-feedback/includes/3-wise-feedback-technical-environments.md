As an experienced developer, you’re often required to review other team members’ code. All developers on the team have varying degrees of experience, with some having advanced programming skills and others more experience with game design. You’ll use wise feedback to ensure all team members work cohesively to bring forward their strengths, and to work on specific areas that need improvement.

## Define wise feedback

How can you provide constructive feedback that will be useful to all persons by being both instructive and motivating? One way might be to provide wise feedback.

*Wise feedback* is targeted feedback that:

- Conveys confidence in the person.

- Communicates high expectations and the genuine belief that the person can achieve those expectations.

- Provides concrete guidance to help the person meet expectations.

In terms of feedback, “wise” doesn’t necessarily mean smarter or better. Instead, it means the feedback is tailored for a recipient while keeping the specific considerations that are unique to the recipient.

For instance, your team consists of people from various ethnicities and backgrounds. Giving critical feedback can be challenging because of mistrust of the instructor’s motive. The recipient might wonder: is this feedback because of my work or because of something else? Wise feedback could be especially important for underrepresented people because this signals that the reviewer believes the person can reach a higher standard.

## Characteristics of wise feedback

Wise feedback is also known as *buffered feedback*. This is feedback where the buffer signals high standards in addition to assurance and confidence in the person’s ability. It includes strategies to help them achieve those high standards, such as:

- “Your work so far is short of the quality you should aim for. We should work together to help you deliver stronger results.”

- “I am confident that you can implement these changes to help improve the robustness of our implementation.”

*Unbuffered feedback* is feedback given in isolation in the form of criticism and does not include any tools or guidance for next steps.

Wise feedback has three main characteristics. To provide wise feedback, you should:

- Signal your intention.

- Be specific.

- Provide steps for improvement.

### Signal your intention

Poor communication can damage trust and relationships. One of the key steps when providing feedback is to signal your intention. Ask yourself, what’s the purpose of your feedback? What do you want to achieve? You should also be cognizant of factors such as race, ethnicity, and gender while framing your feedback. For example, have you considered all possible perspectives of the recipient? Buffered feedback takes all these considerations into account as the following examples illustrate:

- “I’m giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I know that you can reach them.”

- “The expectations in this course are high and I know you can do great work. The feedback here is designed to help you get there.”

Framing feedback in the buffered manner helps to build trust, signals belonging, and combines high standards with the assurance that people can reach them. Of course, simple assurances and trust in the abilities of others are not the only factors needed to become successful.

### Be specific

For feedback to be helpful and useful, you should make it specific. Providing as many details as possible helps people identify their areas of improvement and the skillsets that they need to further develop. Specific feedback also helps the recipient focus on the actual code that is being reviewed. When you receive vague feedback such as, "This was a bad way to structure this code", people are more likely to take it personally.

For example, one of the team members has submitted their code for a game feature. You are aware that although this developer has very strong programming skills in C++, they’re still new to programming in Java. Consider the following options for framing your feedback:

- This code doesn’t run and there a lot of syntax and compile errors. Can you please fix the program?

- I like the way you’ve designed the program structure. This feature will be a great addition to the game. However, I noticed a few syntax and compile errors. I think you might have used some data structures and libraries from C++ that don’t work in Java. The good news is that Java provides built-in libraries that might be able to achieve similar results. I can point you to the relevant libraries. Do you want to try rewriting the code using those instead?

Evaluate both options. Which feedback do you think would be more useful to the developer? Which one might directly result in improved code and achieve better results?

### Provide next steps

In addition to providing specific feedback, it’s equally important to provide clear pathways or specific directions. By providing constructive guidance to the recipients, you can help them take concrete steps to achieve success.

For example, in the earlier scenario you pointed the developer to additional Java programming language documentation to achieve certain programming objectives. You could also share some other code samples that they could use to develop their game features.

## Examples of wise feedback

Wise feedback doesn’t mean you provide empty praise or gloss over any criticism that’s needed. Don’t use statements such as:

- “Well don’t worry about it. This isn’t really that important.”

- “Hey, great job on adding your name at the top. That was great.”

Instead, wise feedback should be direct but supportive, as the following examples illustrate:

- “This is important, and it will require more practice. Here are a few more samples. I know you can do this if you keep at it.”

- “Tell me more about what you did and what you think went wrong. I appreciate how much effort you put in, and it must be so frustrating to have that effort not pan out for you. Are you willing to try a different strategy?”

The following table provides some examples of wise and not wise feedback.

| Not wise                                             | Wise                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “This completely missed the mark.”                   | “This missed the mark. I’d like to  take a minute to review the key elements with you, understand your approach,  and answer any questions. I think you can definitely improve this.” |
| “This needs to be redone.”                           | “This needs to be redone. Are you  willing to try another way? If yes, I’m willing to share with you a few new  strategies. I feel confident that you have what it takes to make this right.  Let me know what you think.” |
| “This is all wrong.”                                 | “This part is all wrong, but this part  is right, and this part is right. I know you can do better than this, and I’d  like you to try it again. Do you need clarification on expectations for the parts that are wrong?” |
| “You got all of the syntax wrong in  this for loop.” | “It seems like you understand the  concept of a for loop, but I notice that you’re struggling with the syntax.  Here’s an example of a working for loop, and here are some strategies that  might help for remembering it. I’m confident that you can do this.” |
