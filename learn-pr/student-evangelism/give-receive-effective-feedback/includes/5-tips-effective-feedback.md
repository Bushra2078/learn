Feedback can vary widely in its content, delivery, and reception depending on the person giving it and the person receiving it. Your development team consists of people with varying temperaments and experiences. You need to follow some guidelines and tips to ensure that the feedback you provide is effective and produces the desired results in the recipient.

## Formulate effective feedback

Often, the way you frame your feedback is a significant factor in how effective it is in helping the recipient learn and improve. Ask yourself, “What is the purpose of my feedback? Is it just to let the person know that they need to improve? Or do I want to play an active role in helping them improve by providing guidance on their progress and steps that they can take?”

It can be hard for the person receiving feedback to extract how to improve from the feedback. Clarifying the areas for improvement and identifying next steps for the recipient to take can make the feedback much more helpful than it would be otherwise. Consider whether the person will be able to process or *unpack* the feedback constructively. Ultimately, the person receiving the feedback should be able to use it to improve their skills. As they become more skilled, their confidence will grow.

### Apply guidelines for providing feedback

The following table lists some of the guidelines that you can follow while giving feedback.

| Guideline        | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ask              | Ask if they’re willing to try a new strategy.                | I can tell that learning to program is very important to you  and I want to help you in your goal. That’s why I’m telling you that your  approach to this assignment doesn’t demonstrate understanding of the  material. Would you be willing to try a different method to complete this  assignment? |
| Signal intention | Explain why you’re  giving this feedback. You believe they can reach a higher standard and you  take them seriously. | Although your code  passes all the unit tests, you didn’t use a for loop as required. Instead,  you have copy-pasted and modified the same piece of code five times. |
| Be specific      | Identify something  specific to improve. Vague feedback can be unhelpful and intimidating. | Are you willing to  try to revise your program? If so, I suggest that you review the notes from the  lecture on for loops and run the sample code. Then come back to this program  and try to replace this part with a for loop.  In the future, you  could try attending office hours to ask for some additional help. |
| Offer            | Offer a suggestion  for a way forward so they leave with more than criticism. | I’m happy to review a second attempt or  brainstorm about other things to do when you’re working on an assignment, and  you get stuck. |

Additionally, you should try to:

- Resist evaluating a person’s ability. Instead, focus on their performance or the approaches they used.

- Emphasize the potential to improve and support the motivation to undertake the challenge.

- Use rubrics so team members can review your priorities and how you think about the process.

- Share feedback ahead of time with the whole group to reduce any sense that different people are receiving different messages.
