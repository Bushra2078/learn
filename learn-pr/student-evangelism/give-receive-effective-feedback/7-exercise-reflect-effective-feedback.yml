  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following statements accurately describes the purpose of signaling attention while giving feedback?"
      choices:
        - content: "Reviewers can reinforce their trust and confidence in the developer’s ability to overcome their challenges."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. By starting their feedback by mentioning what the developer got right, reviewers can reinforce their trust in the developer’s coding skills. As a result, the developer is more likely to be receptive to the corrections that follow."
        - content: "Reviewers can help others learn by fixing the errors for developers."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. By fixing errors for them, reviewers are not helping the developers learn how to prevent such errors in the future."
        - content: "Reviewers can reassign an easier task to the developer and indicate that they should leave the more complicated programs to more experienced team members."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. By reassigning the task to other team members, reviewers are indicating to the developer that they lack trust in the developer to complete the program. This will undermine the developer’s self-confidence and might impact their growth mindset."
