  title: ''
  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following statements about branches in Git is NOT true?'
    choices:
    - content: "A branch is a chain of commits that extend off the main line of development like a branch grows from a tree."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is true. A branch in a Git repo is a chain of changes (commits). The changes extend from the main line of development just like a branch from a tree."
    - content: "Work done on a branch doesn't interfere with work in other branches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is true. The purpose of branches is to isolate changes in one branch from another, until you're ready to merge the changes in both branches together."
    - content: "A branch can have other branches that extend from its line of development."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is true. The purpose of branches is to be able to isolate some changes from other changes in the same project. Git supports the ability to add as many branches and sub-branches as your project requires."            
    - content: "The default branch in a Git repo is named \"master\" and this branch name can never be changed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This statement is false. By default, Git names the default branch \"master,\" but you can rename this branch as you would any other branch." 
  
  - content: 'Which of the following Git commands creates a new branch and then changes your working location to the new branch?'
    choices:
    - content: "`git branch my-new-branch` <br> `git checkout my-new-branch` <br>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can also use the command `git checkout -b my-new-branch` to create and switch to the branch in a single step." 
    - content: "`git branch -new my-new-branch` <br> `git checkout my-new-branch` <br>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Review the parameters for the `git branch` command."
    - content: "`git branch -new my-new-branch` <br> `git switch my-new-branch` <br>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Review the parameters for the `git branch` command. The command `git switch` is valid, although we didn't review it in this module. You can learn more about the [git switch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch) command in the Git documentation."

  - content: 'Suppose you try to merge changes from your local branch into the project repo, but Git returns a merge conflict error. What command can you use to restore the default (main) branch to its correct state?'
    choices:    
    - content: "`git merge --cancel` <br>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The flag `cancel` is not a recognized parameter for the `git merge` command."
    - content: "`git merge --abort` <br>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This command restores the default (main) branch to the state it was in before you tried to merge your changes." 
    - content: "`git merge --reset` <br>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The command `git reset` is valid, but this form isn't correct. The correct form of the command is `git reset --hard`."

  - content: 'Which of the following samples is an accurate view of what Git might show for a merge conflict between the "my-penguins" branch and the "main" branch?'
    choices:
    - content: ":::code source=\"./resources/quiz-sample-1.html\" range=\"1-8\" highlight=\"3,7\":::"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Take a closer look at the other samples. Something is missing in this sample."    
    - content: ":::code source=\"./resources/quiz-sample-2.html\" range=\"1-11\" highlight=\"4,7,9\":::"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Check the location of the content that has conflicts. Git should show the incoming changes above the separator and the existing content in the \"main\" branch below the line."
    - content: ":::code source=\"./resources/quiz-sample-3.html\" range=\"1-11\" highlight=\"4,6,9\":::"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Git shows the entire file. Angle brackets show the content that has conflicts. A line of double dashes separates the conflicting versions. The incoming changes are shown above the separator line and the existing content in the \"main\" branch are shown below."
