You're a web developer trying to learn more about Git for work. You've created a simple HTML and CSS website about cats to practice your skills and have been working on it with your friends, Alice and Bob. As your project progresses, you realize you'd like for everyone to be able to work on more than one task at a time without getting in one another's way. You need a way to keep everyone's work separate so new development doesn't get in the way of existing bugfixes.

_Branches_ make this easy. The work done "on a branch" doesn't have to be shared, and it doesn't interfere with other branches. Branches let you keep the commits related to each topic together and in isolation, making changes easy to review and track. Modern software development is done almost entirely in branches. The goal is to keep the main branch clean until the work is ready to check in. Then you push your changes to the main branch, or better yet, submit a pull request for the merge.

An advantage Git has over older version control systems is that creating a branch is extremely fast with Git; it amounts to writing a 40-character hash into a file under `.git/heads`. Switching branches is also fast, because Git stores whole files and unzips them instead of trying to reconstruct them from lists of changes. Merging in Git isn't _quite_ that simple, but it's straightforward and often completely automatic. Let's learn what branches are, how they're used, and how they work.

## Understand branches

A _branch_ is simply a chain of commits that "branch off" from the main line of development, like a branch on a tree.

If you're switching to Git from another version control system, you might be accustomed to slightly different terminology. Subversion names its default branch `trunk`, while Git names it `main`. You can rename the default branch, just as you can rename any other branch. In this module, we name the default branch `main`.

A branch usually starts with a commit on the default branch, in this case, on `main`. The branch grows a separate history chain as commits are added. Eventually, the changes in the branch are merged back into `main`. You'll learn to make commits in a branch and merge them into the `main` branch in this module.

Suppose you branch off the `main` branch. Here's how to visualize what happens:

Each capital letter in the diagram represents a commit. Branches have names like `add-authentication` and `fix-css-bug`, and branches can have branches of their own. The ultimate goal is to let developers do what they need to do without stepping on one another, and to wind up with a main branch that represents the best efforts of everyone involved.

## Create and switch branches with git branch and git checkout

A common reason to create a new branch is to make changes to an existing feature. A branch for this purpose would commonly be called a _topic branch_ or _feature branch_.

You can create a new branch by using the `git branch` command. Switch between branches by using the `git checkout` command.

You've already encountered `checkout` as a way of replacing files in the working tree by getting them from the index. With no paths in the argument list, `checkout` updates *everything* in the working tree and the index to match the specified commitâ€”in this case, the head of the branch.

## Merge branches with git merge

When you've finalized some work, like a feature or a bug fix, in a branch, you'll want to _merge_ that branch back into the main branch. You can use the `git merge` command to merge a specific branch into your current branch.

For example, if you were working in a branch named `my-feature`, the workflow would look like this code:

```bash
# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge my-feature branch into main
git merge my-feature
```

After using these commands (and resolving any _merge conflicts_, which we will discuss later), all the changes from your `my-feature` branch would be in `main`.
