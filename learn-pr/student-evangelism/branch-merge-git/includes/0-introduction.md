Imagine that you're a new software developer at a firm that writes avionics software for commercial airliners. Quality control is critical, and developers work in small teams by using Git for version control. You already know a little bit about Git. You've used it to track your changes, fix mistakes, and collaborate with other developers through a shared repo and pull requests. However, you know that there's more to using Git, and you're excited to learn!

You've already started a little website that lets you and your friends share pictures of your cats to practice Git, and you've enlisted a couple friends who are also software developers to help out.

As you get going, you want to make collaborating with your friends easier, so you can all work on separate features without getting in each others' way.

In this module, you'll learn what branches are in Git, how to use them for development, and how to merge branches, including dealing with minor merge conflicts.
