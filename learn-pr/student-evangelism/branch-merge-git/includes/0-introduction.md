Imagine you're a new software developer at a firm that writes avionics software for commercial airliners. Quality control is critical, and developers work in small teams using Git for version control. You already know a little bit about Git. You've used it to track your changes, fix mistakes, and collaborate with other developers through a shared repo and pull requests. However you know there is more to using Git and you're excited to learn!

You've already started a little website that lets you and your friends share pictures of your cats to practice Git, and enlisted a couple of friends who are also software developers to help out.

As you get going, you want to make collaborating with them easier so you can all work on separate features without getting in each others' way.
