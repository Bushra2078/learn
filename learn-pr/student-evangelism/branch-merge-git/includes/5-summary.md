Congratulations! In this module, you learned how to use Git branches to collaborate with other developers and resolve merge conflicts.

You learned:

- What branches are, and how and when to use them.
- How to merge branches.
- How to deal with merge conflicts when they come up.

At this point, you know enough about Git to work with other developers!

If you'd like to dig deeper, here are some other resources that you'll find helpful:

- On the command line, enter `git help tutorial` or `git help tutorial-2`.
- See the [Everyday Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/everyday) site, which is also available from the command line, as `git help everyday`.
- Review GitHub's [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources).

You can also learn more from the [documentation section](https://git-scm.com/doc) of [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com).
