Alice wants to add some CSS to style the cat pictures, and she'll want to work in her own branch to do so.

## Setup

Before we can practice being Alice, we must do some work to set up a bare repo for everyone to share, and add some files.

Git is already installed for us in Azure Cloud Shell, so we can use Git in Cloud Shell to the right.

### Create a bare shared repo

1. Create a new directory named "Shared.git" to hold the bare repo.

    ```bash
    mkdir Shared.git
    cd Shared.git
    ```

1. Now use the following command to create a bare repo in the shared directory:

    ```bash
    git init --bare
    ```

### Clone the shared repo for Alice and Bob

1. Move back up out of this directory, and create directories for Alice and Bob to store their repos:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    mkdir Alice
    mkdir Bob
    ```

1. Clone the repo for Alice, and configure:

    ```Bash
    cd Alice
    git clone ../Shared.git .
    git config user.name Alice
    git config user.email aice@contoso.com
    ```

1. Clone and configure the repo for Bob:

    ```Bash
    cd ..
    cd Bob
    git clone ../Shared.git .
    git config user.name Bob
    git config user.email bob@contoso.com
    ```

### Add base files

As a final setup step we will add our base website files and push them to the shared repo.

1. Create some files with the Linux `touch` command, then stage them and commit using Git:

    ```bash
    touch index.html
    mkdir Assets
    touch Assets/site.css
    git add .
    git commit index.html -m "Create empty index.html, site.css files"
    ```

1. Now add some HTML to your file using Cloud Shell's code editor which you can open with the `code` command. Open **index.html** in the online editor by typing `code index.html` at the terminal prompt:

    ```bash
    code index.html
    ```

1. Paste in this HTML code:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset='UTF-8'>
        <title>Our Feline Friends</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="CSS/site.css">
      </head>
      <body>
        <nav><a href="./index.html">home</a></nav>
        <h1>Our Feline Friends</h1>
        <p>Eventually we will put cat pictures here.</p>
        <footer><hr>Copyright (c) 2019 Contoso Cats</footer>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save and close the file. You can click the ellipse "..." in the right corner of the cloud editor, or use the accelerator key (Ctrl+S on Windows and Linux, Cmd+S on macOS).

1. Change directories to the **Assets** directory and open **site.css** in the editor:

    ```bash
    cd Assets
    code site.css
    ```

1. Add the following CSS to it:

    ```css
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { font-family: sans-serif; }
    body { font-family: serif; background-color: #F0FFF8; }
    nav, footer { background-color: #C0D8DF; }
    ```

1. Save and close the file. Navigate back up to the **Bob** directory and commit again.

    ```bash
    cd ..
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add simple HTML and stylesheet"
    git push
    ```

1. If you see a warning like this, don't worry:

    ```output
    warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
    Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
    and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

      git config --global push.default matching

    To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

      git config --global push.default simple

    When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
    to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

    Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
    behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
    remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

    See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
    (the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
    'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
    ```

    It's just letting users new about a change to Git's default behaviors. If you'd like to make sure you don't see this warning again, you can type

    ```bash
    git config --global push.default simple
    ```

1. You should see this output indicating success:

    ```output
    Counting objects: 12, done.
    Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (12/12), 1.07 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 12 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To ../Shared.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master
    ```

## Create a branch for Alice

Alice wants to creates a _topic branch_ called "add-style" to do her work. Let's assume the role of Alice, create the branch, and add some code in that branch.

1. Navigate back to the **Alice** directory. The first thing we must do is `git pull` to make sure our copy of the shared repo is up to date:

    ```bash
    cd ../Alice
    git pull
    ```

1. You should see a success message that looks like this:

    ```output
    remote: Counting objects: 8, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    remote: Total 8 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (8/8), done.
    From /home/shana/Alice/../Shared
     * [new branch]      master     -> origin/master
    ```

1. Then use the `git branch` command to create a branch named "add-style," and the `git checkout` command to switch to that branch (make it the *current branch*):

    ```bash
    git branch add-style
    git checkout add-style
    ```

1. Open **site.css** in the **Alice/Assets** directory and add the following CSS class definition to the bottom of the file:

    ```css
    .cat { max-width: 40%; padding: 5 }
    ```

1. Save the changes to the file, close, and commit the change:

    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "Add style for cat pictures"
    ```

1. At this point, Alice wants to make her style available to everyone else, so she switches back to "master" and does a pull in case anyone else has made changes:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ```

1. The output says that "master" is up to date (in other words, "master" on Alice's computer matches "master" in the shared repo), so Alice merges the "add-style" branch into "master" using `git merge --ff-only` to perform a fast-forward merge. Then she pushes "master" from her repo to the shared repo:

    ```bash
    git merge --ff-only add-style
    git push
    ```

Performing a fast-forward merge because "master" had no changes wasn't strictly necessary in this case because Git would have done it anyway. Still, it's a good habit to get into because an `--ff-only` merge fails if "master" has changed, making you acutely aware that changes have occurred.
