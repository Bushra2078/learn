Cloud computing programs aren't as common or widely recognized as other specialist computing degree programs. For this reason, it's essential for marketing and outreach to highlight their unique selling points and identify the ways in which they differ from other programs.

At the University of Lincoln, educators worked with Microsoft to develop a shared goals agreement. This agreement aimed to foster a collaborative relationship between academia and industry to support students with cloud skills through certification opportunities. The following statement captures the essence of the shared goals agreement between Microsoft and the University of Lincoln:

> *“Microsoft and Lincoln share a vision to empower students and ensure they have the skills needed to drive innovation today, when they graduate and when they start their careers. Microsoft and Lincoln wish to make clear that they share these goals and that Lincoln wishes to leverage Microsoft tools and resources to achieve Lincoln’s vision.”*

Shared goal agreements between Microsoft and education institutions have valuable marketing currency. For example, both Microsoft and the University of Lincoln can showcase their partnerships and collaboration, which can be used to enhance marketing strategies. Applicants to programs that adopt shared goal agreements will see that the program of interest has significant industry engagement, and that it's focused on providing industry-transferable skills.

Shared goal agreements are set against a backdrop of significant technology advancements. These include cloud computing, socioeconomic and demographic changes, and increasing job mobility that shifts expectations and places new demands on society. While these changes can bring about positive societal change, education systems, particularly universities, must respond proactively to prepare students for the future.
