In this module, we learned about how to make predictions from past examples in our dataset when our prediction variable is categorical instead of numerical through the machine learning classifier k-Nearest Neighbors. 

Here are the learning objectives we achieved in this module.

- Understand the task of classification and how it's different from regression.
- Introduce K-Nearest Neighbors as a classifier and developed intuition for it.
- Code out a k-NN classifier and assessed its accuracy in Python using the datascience Library.

Congratulations, this is the end of the "Foundations of Data Science" Learning Path!
