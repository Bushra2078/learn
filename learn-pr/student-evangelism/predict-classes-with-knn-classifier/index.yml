title: Predict Classes With A Knn Classifier
summary: Learn about the K-nearest neighbors classifier
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Understand the task of classification and how it's different from regression.
  - Introduce K-Nearest Neighbors as a classifier and developed intuition for it.
  - Code out a k-NN classifier and assessed its accuracy in Python using the datascience Library.
