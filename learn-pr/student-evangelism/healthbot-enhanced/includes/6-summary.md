Both interrupting and breaking scenarios break the current flow and start running a new scenario. The interrupting scenario returns to the main flow, whereas the breaking scenario doesn't. These interrupts are caused by a keyword, which we mention in the model of the scenario. In order to implement an Interrupting scenario, we must enable 'Interrupt Scenario' and disable 'Breaking Scenario'. And while implementing the Breaking scenario, we must enable both the scenarios.
