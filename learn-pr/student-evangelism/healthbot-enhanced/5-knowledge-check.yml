  questions:
    
    - content: "The main difference between the Interrupting Scenario and the Breaking Scenario is..."
      choices:
        - content: "They both are almost the same, we get the same results."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: No, they are not same. One of them returns to the original bot while the other doesn't.
        - content: "The breaking scenario breaks from the current flow and returns, while the interrupting scenario doesn’t return."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: No. Breaking scenario doesn't return to the original bot.
        - content: "The interrupting scenario breaks from the current flow and returns, while the breaking scenario doesn’t return. "
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Yes, the interrupting scenario returns to the main scenario with an interrupt message whereas the breaking scenario doesn’t. It breaks the flow.
    
    - content: "How does the interrupting scenario work?"
      choices:
        - content: "When the user finishes running a bot, the interrupt scenario takes the user to the interrupting bot.  "
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "False. An Interrupting scenario breaks the current flow of the scenario. "
        - content: "When the user enters a keyword as the input, the interrupt scenario takes the user to the interrupting bot."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The keyword is important for the interrupting scenario. The whole interruption 	is possible only because of this keyword. This is defined while creating a new model."
        - content: "When the user interrupts the present bot by clicking on stop, the interrupt scenario takes the user to the interrupting bot."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There is no option for the user to click on stop while the bot is running. Ending the current flow of the bot doesn't take the user to the interrupting bot."
        

    - content: "Which of the following needs to be unique?"
      choices:
        - content: "Returning Message"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Returning message can be same for more than one scenario."
        - content: "Description"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Description of one scenario can be same as the description of another scenario."
        - content: "Scenario ID"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Scenario ID is unique to every scenario. This is necessary to map the scenario."
