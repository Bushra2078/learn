In this module, you learned the basics of building websites in Python by using the Flask framework. You learned that Python code goes in a file named **app.py** and that code in that file calls Flask functions such as `render_template()` and `flash()`. You also learned how to programmatically inject content into HTML templates by using Flask expressions, and how to use `@app.route()` to connect functions in your code to routes that the application supports. Finally, you learned how easy it is to use the Azure CLI `az webapp up` command to upload a website that you have written and tested locally to an Azure App Service instance.

In addition, you discovered that you can use Azure Cognitive Services to build intelligent applications infused with AI. The Computer Vision API extracts text from images, identifies objects in those images, and more. It can even generate captions for the images that you upload. And the Translator Text API translates text between dozens of languages. Combined with other services in Cognitive Services, these APIs make it possible to write apps that you could have only dreamed about a few years ago.
