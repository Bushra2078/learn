This module demonstrated the application of an interrupting scenario and a breaking scenario. The interrupting scenario can be considered a branch that passes back the control back to the main scenario. On the other hand, the breaking scenario is a branch that doesn't return control to the main scenario, but breaks the process and stops the Azure Health Bot conversation. These scenario options provide a better scope for any specific application that you might design. In this module, the conversation is stopped after collecting the temperature.

It's most important to note that both these scenarios are triggered when a keyword is entered. For the bot in this module, the keyword "vitals" is used to shift control from one scenario to another. In this way, keywords act as a trigger to switch between the scenarios.
