The goal of this module was to demonstrate the application of an interrupting and breaking scenario. The major difference that these two offer is that the former type can be considered like a branch that passes back the control back to the main scenario whereas the latter is a branch that doesnt return back the control to the main scenario,instead breaks the process and so the Azure Health Bot conversation is stopped. Such scenario options provide a better scope for any specific application that we would like to design. For example in this module we stopped it after collecting the temperature.

The most important part be noted here is that, both these scenarios are being triggered when a keyword is entered. In the bot we just designed "vitals" was the keyword that shifted the control from one scenario to other. So we can infer that keywords act as a trigger to switch between the scenarios.
