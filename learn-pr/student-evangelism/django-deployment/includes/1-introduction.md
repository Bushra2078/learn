As you likely know, development and production have a different set of requirements. Preparing an application for production can take a few steps. Fortunately, the actual deployment process doesn't need to be overly complex.

In this module, you'll walk through the steps to prepare a Django application for production. You'll then create a database and hosting environment for your application by using Visual Studio Code. You'll finish by deploying your site to Azure and seeing your application run in the cloud.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Configure an application for production.
- Install an extension in Visual Studio Code.
- Use the Azure Databases extension to create a PostgreSQL database.
- Use the App Service extension to deploy a website to Azure.
- Run migrations on a database hosted in Azure.
