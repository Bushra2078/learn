Before jumping straight to the solution, a key step for the startup is to identify which customers the company tries to serve through its products and services. Remember, you can't really have any startup/ business without customers. With your idea in mind, think about the needs of your most important users and their attributes including demographics and categorization. Your most important customers could be:

1. **A mass market** - Your product considered to serve a wide view of potential users with no specific attributes.
1. **A niche market** - Your product is customized for uses with a specialized need and characteristics.
1. **Segmented market** - Looking at an existing customer segment, your product is highly customized for a distinguished portion of the customer group.
1. **Diverse market** - Your product(s) serve multiple customers with different needs and characteristics.
