Imagine you're a new software developer at a firm that writes avionics software for commercial airliners. Quality control is critical, and developers work in small teams using Git for version control. You already know some things about Git, and have used it on your own, locally to track your changes and fix mistakes. However, you know that version control is most useful for working with others on code and you want to get some practice!

You've already started a little website that lets you and your friends share pictures of your cats to practice Git. You enlist a couple of friends who are also software developers to help out.

You'll be using Git to aid in collaboration, keep track of changes (and who makes them), make sure nothing bad happens when two people change the same file, and keep all the source code files backed up.

In this module, you accomplish all these things and more with Git.
