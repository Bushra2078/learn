Congratulations! In this module, you learned how to use Git to collaborate with other developers.

You learned:

- How to clone a repository.
- What pull requests are and how to initiate them.
- How to stash changes.
- How to push your changes and update your repo by pulling.

At this point, you know enough about Git to collaborate in a simple way, but there's still much more to learn!

If you would like to dig deeper, here are some other resources that you'll find helpful:

- On the command line, run `git help tutorial` and `git help tutorial-2`.
- [Everyday Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/everyday) (also available from the command line, as `git help everyday`).
- GitHub's [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources).

You also can learn more from the [documentation section](https://git-scm.com/doc) of [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com).
