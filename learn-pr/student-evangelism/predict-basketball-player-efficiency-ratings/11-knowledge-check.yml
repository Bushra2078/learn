  Answer the multiple choice questions to check your understanding of data cleansing and manipulation.
quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What does PER stand for in basketball stats?"
    choices:
    - content: "Player Efficiency Rating"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The PER is the player efficiency rating, which is calculated using a complex algorithm and measurable game stats per player."
    - content: "Player Earned Rebound"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Rebounds are counted in three columns: ORR, DRR, and REBR for offensive and deffensive rebound rates and overall rebound rate."
    - content: "Player Effective Role"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Each player has a position, but that is not data captured with numerical data."
    - content: "Player Elbow Rating"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While 'elbow' is used to describe the upper corner of the lane on either end of the free-throw line, it isn't a stat that is often kept track of."
  - content: "How did you impute data that is normally distributed in this module?"
    choices:
    - content: "Regression Imputation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While regression imputation is effective, it might be too much effort for data that has a normal distribution."
    - content: "Mean Imputation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When data is normally distributed, but the ordering of the data is unknown, using the average can be an effective imputation strategy."
    - content: "Zero Value Imputation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Replacing missing values with zero could be effective depending on the data set, but using the average is more likely to yield a close-to accurate value."
    - content: "Above or Below Imputation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When the order of data is unknown, filling missing values with the value in the row before or after the current row is less likely to yield a close-to accurate value."
  - content: "What is cross-validation?"
    choices:
    - content: "A methodology for creating data-related hypothesis."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cross-validation is used in machine model training, not in data exploration."
    - content: "A methodology for data collection to ensure authenticity of your dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cross-validation is used in machine model training, not in data gathering."
    - content: "A programmatic way to check the accuracy of your dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cross-validation is used in machine model training, not in dataset cleansing."
    - content: "A programmatic way to split your data into `n` training and testing subsets to test the accuracy of your model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Rather than doing one split on your data to test the accuracy, cross-validation will randomly select `n`-splits to ensure an accurate score."
