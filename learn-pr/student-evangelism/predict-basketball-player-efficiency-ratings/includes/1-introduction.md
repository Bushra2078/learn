[Space Jam: A New Legacy](https://spacejam.com/) is a film about basketball and coding. [Official synopsis to be put here].

Inspired by the film, this module explores the connection that data science and machine learning has with sports, specifically basketball. If you're a sports fan, you know that statistics (stats) on players is a huge part to the game. We've seen how stats play a role in the fans of the game, for example through buiding fantasy leagues. This module starts to give us, the fans, an insight into how stats might be used by the coaches and teams. 

Through this module, you will have an opportunity to explore stats related to basketball players (both human and Looney Tunes). You will learn how various stats result in PER (player efficiency rating), which is a per-minute productivity rating of each player. Our goal is to use machine learning practices to create a clean data set of players to be used during games to make quick decisions and optimize a teams' chance of winning.

This module is part of a multi-modal approach to learning, which means that you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr G Learn TV video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/SpaceJam).

## Learning Objectives

 In this module, you will:

- Use Python, Pandas, and Visual Studio Code
- Cleanse and manipulate data that require critical analysis
- Use machine learning to cleanse and complete data
- Prepare data to be used for multiple customer-facing uses

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code, with the Python Extension](https://aka.ms/LearnOnVSCode)
- A local Python environment set up, as seen in [Discover the role of Python in space exploration](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/introduction-python-space-exploration-nasa/)
