Welcome to the Jam!  NBA champion and cultural icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless Tune Bugs Bunny with the animated/live-action event “Space Jam: A New Legacy,” from director Malcolm D. Lee and an innovative filmmaking team including Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.  This transformational journey is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of NBA and WNBA stars as you’ve never seen them before.  It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even “King” James by playing the game their own way.  

Inspired by the film, this module explores the connection that data science and machine learning has with sports, specifically basketball. If you're a sports fan, you know that statistics (stats) on players is a huge part to the game. We've seen how stats play a role in the fans of the game, for example through building fantasy leagues. This module starts to give us, the fans, an insight into how stats might be used by the coaches and teams.

Through this module, you will have an opportunity to explore stats related to basketball players (both human and Tune Squad). You will learn how various stats result in PER (player efficiency rating), which is a per-minute productivity rating of each player. Our goal is to use machine learning practices to create a clean data set of players to be used during games to make quick decisions and optimize a teams' chance of winning.

This module is part of a multi-modal approach to learning, which means that you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr G Learn TV video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/SpaceJamANewLegacy?azure-portal=true).
