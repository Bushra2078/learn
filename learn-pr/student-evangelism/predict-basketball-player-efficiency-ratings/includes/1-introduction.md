Welcome to the jam! In the animated and live-action film *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, NBA champion and cultural icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside the timeless character Bugs Bunny. Along with director Malcolm D. Lee, the innovative filmmaking team includes Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.  

The film is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When a rogue AI traps LeBron and his young son Dom in a digital space, LeBron must get them home safely by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny, and the gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory. Their opponents are the AI's digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of NBA and WNBA stars as you've never seen them before.  It's Tunes versus goons in the highest-stakes challenge of LeBron's life. The journey will redefine his bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents, and surprise even "King" James by playing the game their own way.  

Inspired by the film, this module explores the connection between sports (specifically basketball) and data science and machine learning. If you're a sports fan, you know that statistics (stats) about players are a huge part of the game. In a previous module, you saw how fans can use stats, for example by building fantasy leagues. This module gives you insight into how coaches and teams can use stats.

In this module, you get to explore stats related to basketball players (both human and animated). You'll learn how various stats result in a PER (player efficiency rating), which is the per-minute productivity rating for each player. Your goal is to use machine learning practices to create a clean dataset of players. The dataset is used during games to make quick decisions and optimize a team's chance of winning.

This module is part of a multimodal approach to learning. So you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr. G video series on Learn TV](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/Basketball/Videos?azure-portal=true).
