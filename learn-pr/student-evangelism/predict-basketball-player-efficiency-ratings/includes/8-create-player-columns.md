Since we have identified the groups of players by examining the bimodal histograms, let's make a column to indicate whether a row represents a human or Looney Tune and give each one a unique "name".

First, we need to create the new column for the DataFrame. We do this by creating a list of values for the column and then assigning the column a name.

```python
# Initialize the list to house the player data.
pop_list = []

# If the ID number is 30 or less, it is a human player; other, they are Looney Tunes.
for id in player_df['ID']:
    if id <= 30:
        pop_list.append('player'+str(id))
    else:
        pop_list.append('looney_tune'+str(id%30))

pop_list
```

```output
['player1',
 'player2',
 'player3',
 'player4',
 'player5',
 'player6',
 'player7',
 'player8',
 'player10',
 'player11',
 'player12',
 'player13',
 'player14',
 'player15',
 'player16',
 'player17',
 'player18',
 'player19',
 'player21',
 'player22',
 'player23',
 'player24',
 'player26',
 'player27',
 'player28',
 'player29',
 'looney_tune1',
 'looney_tune2',
 'looney_tune3',
 'looney_tune4',
 'looney_tune5',
 'looney_tune6',
 'looney_tune7',
 'looney_tune8',
 'looney_tune9',
 'looney_tune11',
 'looney_tune12',
 'looney_tune13',
 'looney_tune14',
 'looney_tune15',
 'looney_tune16',
 'looney_tune17']
```

**NOTE:** We did a quick shortcut with creating the numbers for the Looney Tunes players by using `str(id%30)`. The modulus operator (`%`) will divide and return the difference. So, for every id after 30, the code will enter the `else` branch. For example, for 31, the else branch will create a string that is `looney_tune` + `str(id%30)`, which would be `str(31%30)`. If you do the math, 31 divided by 30 is 0 remainder 1. So the player string for row with ID 31 would be `looney_tune_1`.

Now, we can add this list of strings to the DataFrame. 

```python
# Assign this list as the values for the new player column in the DataFrame.
player_df['player'] = pop_list
player_df.head()
```

```output
	ID	points	possessions	team_pace	GP	MPG	TS%	AST	TO	USG	ORR	DRR	REBR	PER	player
0	1	1893.0	1251.8	97.8	63.0	33.9	0.569	17.2	11.5	26.1	4.7	23.3	7.8	10.90	player1
1	2	1386.0	1282.5	110.5	58.0	32.5	0.511	24.8	9.7	26.9	6.1	0.9	10.7	27.30	player2
2	3	1405.0	1252.3	105.8	55.0	36.3	0.605	25.7	13.9	28.1	4.5	4.9	1.8	NaN	player3
3	4	1282.0	1235.9	100.7	54.0	37.6	0.636	29.5	11.0	22.3	4.8	4.6	5.6	22.35	player4
4	5	1721.0	1254.0	105.7	59.0	30.5	0.589	22.8	9.9	24.6	1.2	8.4	12.1	28.38	player5
```

Having the new column at the last column (the default location for new columns) will cause us problems later, so let's move that to be just to the right of `ID`. Because we have more columns than would be easy to explicitly type, create list of all but the last column (now `player`) and use the `insert()` list method to move it to the second position in the list. (Remember that Python uses 0-indexing!) We will then use that altered list to specify the order of columns in the `player_df` DataFrame.

```python
# Create list of all but the last DataFrame column names.
column_list = list(player_df.iloc[:, :-1])

# Make player the second item in the list.
column_list.insert(1, 'player')

# Reassign the columns in the player_df DataFrame in this new order.
player_df = player_df[column_list]

# Verify that the columns are ordered the way you expect.
player_df.head()
```

```output
	ID	player	points	possessions	team_pace	GP	MPG	TS%	AST	TO	USG	ORR	DRR	REBR	PER
0	1	player1	1893.0	1251.8	97.8	63.0	33.9	0.569	17.2	11.5	26.1	4.7	23.3	7.8	10.90
1	2	player2	1386.0	1282.5	110.5	58.0	32.5	0.511	24.8	9.7	26.9	6.1	0.9	10.7	27.30
2	3	player3	1405.0	1252.3	105.8	55.0	36.3	0.605	25.7	13.9	28.1	4.5	4.9	1.8	NaN
3	4	player4	1282.0	1235.9	100.7	54.0	37.6	0.636	29.5	11.0	22.3	4.8	4.6	5.6	22.35
4	5	player5	1721.0	1254.0	105.7	59.0	30.5	0.589	22.8	9.9	24.6	1.2	8.4	12.1	28.38
```

Now we have a DataFrame that contains all of the player data with a new player column that represents whether the row is stats for a human player or a Looney Tunes player. But as you can see, there are still missing values that we need to impute.
