Learning to code is only as useful as what you use it for. Coding for data science discoveries is becoming more prominant in all aspects of the technical world and critical in almost every industry. Whether you are gathering data about the [Moon to drive space exploration decisions](https://aka.ms/LearnInSpace), or being inspired by LeBron James to use data to learn more about basketball, the goal is to develop new skills to help you explore what **you're** passionate about.

[Space Jam: A New Legacy](https://spacejam.com) isn't just a film about basketball and fun Looney Tunes characters, it also begins to explore ways in which we can combine passions to an even greater outcome. LeBron is clearly a leader in the world of NBA basketball, he got there by learning from his failures, persisting through challenging times, and practicing. These skills are not isolated to basketball, the same skills are critical for learners starting their coding journey. This module introduces you to Python coding for data science, and it's just the start. With the skills you have begun to learn here, you can begin to explore other datasets, discover new insights, and contribute in your own unique way to the understanding of our world.

Throughout this module you have taken publicly available data about professional basketball players, and some manufactured data about Looney Tunes players, and created a dataset of player stats that can be used in various further data analysis and applications. While data on Looney Tunes players may not impact your fantasy team for the NBA or a coaches draft picks, they can help us enjoy the learning journey and broaden the way we approach solving similar problems.

With the `player_data_final.csv` file that you created, you can use the data to determine the best draft picks for a combination Human+Looney Tune team, or use this data to determine decisions in the heat of the game. For example, in the following module for this learning path inspired by Space Jam: A New Legacy, you will use this data to create an app that Coach Daffy Duck can use to figure out which player should be given a water break during a game. 

Remember, this module is a part of a multi-modal approach to learning, which means that you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr G video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/SpaceJam).
