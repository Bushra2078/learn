Code is only as useful as what it's used for. Coding for data science discoveries is becoming more prominent in all aspects of the technical world. It's critical in almost every industry. Maybe you're gathering data about the [Moon to drive space exploration decisions](https://aka.ms/LearnInSpace?azure-portal=true). Or maybe you're being inspired by basketball champion LeBron James to use data to learn more about the sport. Whatever you pursue, you can develop new skills to help you explore what *you* are passionate about.

*Space Jam: A New Legacy* isn't just a film about basketball. Through LeBron and the Tune Squad characters, it also explores ways in which people can combine their passions to reach a greater outcome. LeBron is clearly a leader in the world of basketball. He succeeded by learning from failures, persisting through challenging times, and practicing. These skills aren't unique to basketball. They're just as critical for learners starting their coding journey. 

This module introduced you to Python coding for data science. But it's just the start. From here, you can use your new skills to explore other datasets, discover new insights, and contribute in your own unique way to the understanding of this world.

In this module, you started with publicly available data about professional basketball players, and some manufactured data about Tune Squad players. Now you have a dataset of player stats that can be used in various data analysis applications. Although data about Tune Squad players might not affect your fantasy team for the NBA or a coach's draft picks, it might help you broaden the way you approach solving future problems.

You can use the `player_data_final.csv` file that you created to determine the best draft picks for a combined human and Tune Squad team. Or you can use this data to make decisions in the heat of the game. For example, in the next module in this learning path, you'll use the data to create an app that a coach can use to figure out which player should be given a water break during a game. 

Remember, this module is a part of a multimodal approach to learning. So you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr. G video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/Basketball/Videos?azure-portal=true).
