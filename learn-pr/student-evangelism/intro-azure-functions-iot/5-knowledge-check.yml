quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which characteristic of Azure Functions for IoT helps to deploy large-scale IoT applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Functions for IoT can manage demand that spikes up or down."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Functions for IoT enable developers to create scalable IoT applications that can be rapidly deployed without provisioning a fixed infrastructure capacity in advance. This helps with large-scale IoT solutions where demand from IoT devices can spike up or down rapidly."
    - content: "Azure Functions for IoT are secure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Security doesn't directly help in scaling solutions"
    - content: "Azure Functions for IoT can manage large volumes of data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "In themselves, IoT functions aren't related to managing large data volumes"
  - content: "An Azure Function has two parts - Triggers and Bindings.  Collectively, what do Triggers and Bindings achieve?"
    choices:
    - content: "Triggers and Bindings help to create a scalable solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Scalable solutions are a feature of Azure solutions but aren't uniquely related to Triggers and Bindings."
    - content: "Triggers and bindings help you to avoid hardcoding access to other services."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The trigger invokes the function and provides data needed by the function. Bindings connect resources to the function. Data from bindings is provided to the function as parameters. Thus, Triggers and bindings help you to avoid hardcoding access to other services."
    - content: "Triggers and Bindings provide a rapid response to events."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Triggers and Bindings aren't uniquely responsible for providing a rapid response to events."
  - content: "Identify the feature of Azure Functions for IoT that ensure that you're charged only for the resources you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Functions for IoT are faster hence they use less resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The speed of execution doesn't directly impact overall resources."
    - content: "Azure Functions can be managed through a dashboard."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The existence of a dashboard doesn't impact the cost."
    - content: "You don't have to pre-allocate the resources in advance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You're charged only for the resources you use. Your solution can scale up or down dynamically and instantly depending on the business requirements. You don't have to manage the infrastructure and to allocate the resources in advance. The system does that for you."
