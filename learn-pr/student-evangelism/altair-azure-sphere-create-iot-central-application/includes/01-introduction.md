Azure IoT Central is built on the [Eight attributes of successful IoT solutions](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/8-attributes-of-successful-iot-solutions?azure-portal=true).

## IoT Central and Azure Sphere tenant trust

Trust is established by sharing your Azure Sphere tenant Certificate Authority certificate with your IoT Central application.

With trust established, your devices will be provisioned with your Altair IoT Central application. Trusted certificates with be used to sign and secure network traffic between your Azure Sphere and IoT Central.

In this module, you will:

* Create an Azure IoT Central application. 
* Set up a trusted relationship between your Azure Sphere tenant and Azure IoT Central.
* Create an enrollment group.
* Create and validate a tenant CA certificate.
