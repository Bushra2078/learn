Welcome to the learning path about the cloud-connected Altair 8800 on Azure Sphere. In this module, you'll learn about Azure IoT Central and how to use it to create the IoT web portal for the Altair emulator.

## Scenario: Creating an IoT web portal

It's common to build a web portal for your IoT applications. Azure IoT Central is a [low-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform?azure-portal=true) environment that you can use to build IoT web portals. 

When you build an Azure IoT Central application, you describe the data that a device sends, along with device interactions and how you want to view the data in the web portal. Azure IoT Central uses [IoT Plug and Play](/azure/iot-develop/overview-iot-plug-and-play?azure-portal=true) so you can describe device data, describe device cloud interactions, and create default data views without manual configuration.

## What will you learn?

In this module, you'll learn how to create an Azure IoT Central application for the Altair 8800 emulator and enable trust between that application and Azure Sphere. From the Azure IoT Central application, you can set Altair parameters, review diagnostic information, chart memory usage, and track environment data.

## What is the main goal?

You can use the Azure IoT Central application that you create in this module to set up a web portal for the Altair emulator.
