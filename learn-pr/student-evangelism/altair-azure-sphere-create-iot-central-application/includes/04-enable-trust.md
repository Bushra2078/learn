After you create your Azure IoT Central application, you must establish trust between it and the Azure Sphere tenant. 

You establish trust by downloading a certificate authority (CA) certificate from the Azure Sphere Security Service and validating it by using a code generated by Azure IoT Central. The validation process authenticates your Azure Sphere tenant. The next unit will walk you through that exercise.

With trust established, the devices in your Azure Sphere tenant will be provisioned by your Azure IoT Central application. Trusted certificates are used to sign and secure network traffic between Azure Sphere and Azure IoT Central.
