  questions:
  - content: "What role does Azure IoT Central play?"
    choices:
    - content: "IoT Central runs on Azure Sphere and will be used to configure the Altair 8800 emulator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure IoT Central is a cloud-based solution that is used to configure the Altair emulator running on Azure Sphere."
    - content: "The Altair emulator runs on Azure IoT Central"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Altair emulator runs on Azure Sphere. Azure IoT Central is a cloud-based solution that will be used to configure the Altair emulator."
    - content: "Azure IoT Central is a cloud-based solution used to configure the Altair emulator running on the Azure Sphere."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure IoT Central is a cloud-based application that in this case will be used to configure the Altair emulator running on Azure Sphere. The Altair emulator will also report diagnostic information and weather telemetry to IoT Central."
  - content: "Azure Sphere is secure by design and secure by default. This means?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Sphere will connect by default to known safe network endpoints. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You must configure the AllowedConnections section in the app_manifest.json file. The application running on Azure Sphere can only connect to network endpoints that are declared in that section. You must declare the test.mosquitto.org endpoint and the IoT central endpoints so the Altair emulator can connect to these network endpoints."
    - content: "Azure Sphere can only connect to network endpoints defined in the AllowedConnections section of the app_manifest.json file."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You must declare the test.mosquitto.org endpoint and the IoT central endpoints so the Altair emulator can connect to these network endpoints."
    - content: "By default, Azure Sphere can connect to any Azure cloud-based service including Azure IoT Central."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The application running on Azure Sphere can only connect to network endpoints that are declared in the AllowedConnections section of the app_manifest.json file. You must declare the test.mosquitto.org endpoint and the IoT central endpoints so the Altair emulator can connect to these network endpoints."
