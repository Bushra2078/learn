Although you might think that the hard part of collecting space rocks is over after you've flown a rocket 238,855 miles to the Moon, you would be mistaken. Even after astronauts or a rover land on the Moon, selecting rocks that are valuable to research becomes a serious challenge. With limited space on rockets to bring back samples to Earth, and with so many types of space rocks out there, choosing which ones to collect and which ones to leave behind is a difficult process. You might imagine it this way: If you could choose only one place on Earth to fully understand Earth, where would you go? It's not possible. So, you narrow the scope. If you go to a region on Earth, like the Grand Canyon, which rocks would you select to try to fully understand that area? It's still a challenging task.

## Teaching astronauts

Astronauts complete substantial preparations prior to a launch into space. Their priorities are a safe and successful journey to their destination. But one of the main goals of traveling to the Moon, for example, is to collect specimens so that we can better understand our Moon and the wider Solar System. 

Have you ever walked along a beach looking for rocks that are pretty or unusual? You might spend a good few hours looking, trying not to miss anything special, but not wanting to get down on hands and knees to examine each rock. The surface of the Moon is essentially covered with potential samples that an astronaut might collect and take back to Earth. And the types of rocks aren't easily identifiable with a glance.

For example, there are common rocks on the Moon, like basalt and highland. (Highland rock is the original crust of the Moon.) But there's also a layer of rock and soil, known as the regolith, which has been broken up by impacts. Another kind of a rock is breccia, which is a combination of other rocks smashed together. So, the chemical composition of these rocks may be similar to the original rock types, but they might not be what the astronaut was instructed to collect. 

Furthermore, the photos of rocks that you'll see in this learning path have already been cleaned. The photos were taken in a studio, with good lighting, and really close-up. Being able to identify these rocks on the surface of the Moon, in a space suit, without being to touch the rock, and with less than ideal lighting, makes it even more of a challenge.

Here's a photo of basalt rock:

## Being unique isn't always a good thing

Another aspect of gathering space rocks that might be hard to conceptualize is the procedure for picking up rocks that look "different." If you see a white rock surrounded by all black rocks, a person's instinct is to pick up the white rock and ignore all the black rocks. However, collecting only this white rock wouldn't provide us with an understanding of the “average” rocks in the area, just the unique one. Therefore, astronauts are asked to also collect samples of the black rocks to get an accurate representation of the area. A common trick is to pick up 10 average rocks in the area, and then collect the rocks that look more unique.

## Rovers

Having astronauts learn about rocks is one thing, but using rovers to pick up the correct rocks on the Moon is also difficult. Sending instructions to a rover so far away takes a long time, so many instructions have to be simple, like *move forward* or *turn right*. Also, as you'll see in this learning path, having a computer accurately identify rocks on the ground when rocks used to create the AI model were cleaned and professionally photographed is a challenge. Rocks on the ground are covered with dirt and dust, the lighting might be poor, shadows are prevalent, and the surrounding landscape is covered with similar-looking material. Rocks on the ground on the Moon might not look like the rocks in photos of rocks in the lab, even if they are the same type of rock.
