The application of AI that we'll focus on in this learning path is the classification of space rocks by a computer. You might be wondering why we're learning about something as commonplace as rocks. The answer is that there are many amazing things we can learn from and do with rocks from space landscapes.

## What are space rocks?

Before we jump into why we choose to study space rocks, let's first classify the different rocks and soil that NASA scientists research. Rocks and soil from space come in many sizes, ranging from tiny specs of soil found on the moon to planet-sized boulders that float through space. The boulders can be found flying through space (known as *meteors* or *asteroids*), on the surface of moons and planets, and even on the surface of Earth (meteorites). 

## Why are space rocks important?

When I first started learning about space rocks, I thought, "Why does NASA keep sending rockets to the moon to get space rocks?" (Please don't tell NASA I said that.) However, there are many different uses of space rocks. We won't cover all the uses for space rocks because of the sheer volume.

For one, rocks tell us about the history of our universe. Space rocks have been here much longer than we have been, and they'll be here long after we are gone. For example, we have a lot of the granite on Earth, but granite is very uncommon everywhere else in the solar system. This tells us that most likely, a granite asteroid hit Earth at some point when our planet was forming.

Along with finding out about the history of the universe, we study space rocks to prepare for the future. Although it might seem like a long way off now, at some point, we might harvest space rocks as a resource like we gather wood from trees on Earth now. Many space rocks contain gasses and rare chemical compounds that aren't found on Earth. In the future, we might potentially use these resources to create new technology on Earth.

The final example of what studying space rocks can do for us is help us find signs of life, or the ability to sustain life. Many rocks in the universe are water-bearing, and if we know a lot about these rocks, we can search for planets that contain these rocks and potentially find life or a place that can sustain human life.
