The application of AI that we focus on in this learning path is using a computer to classify space Rocks. You might be wondering why we would want to study something as commonplace as a rock. The answer is that there are many amazing things we can learn from and do with rocks that originate in space.

## What are space rocks?

Before we jump into why we choose to study space rocks, let's first classify the different rocks and soil that NASA scientists study. Rocks and soil from space come in many sizes, ranging from tiny specs of soil found on the Moon to boulders the size of planets that float through space. Boulders that originate in space might be discovered flying through space as *meteoroids* and *asteroids* or found on the surface of moons, planets, and even Earth as *meteorites*. 

## Why space rocks are important

When I first started to learn about space rocks, I thought, "*Why* does NASA keep sending rockets to the Moon to collect space rocks?" (Please don't tell NASA I said that.) Now, I know that space rocks have many uses. In this module, we won't cover all the ways we can use space rocks because of the sheer volume. But for one, rocks tell us about the history of our Solar System as they record geological events, like the eruption of a volcano. Space rocks have been here much longer than humans, and they'll be here long after we are gone.

An example of how we learn about the Solar System by studying space rocks, is the rock type granite. Granite is plentiful on Earth, but our research tells us that granite is rare everywhere else in the Solar System. We know that granite is formed in tectonic regions, where mountains are formed. Many other planets and their moons don't have plate tectonics. This difference between Earth and other parts of the Solar System gives us background information about the current structure of other planets and how the planets were formed.

Along with learning about the history of the Solar System, space rocks can help us in our search to find signs of life or the ability to sustain life other than on Earth. Many rocks in the Universe are water-bearing. If we know a lot about these rocks, we can search for planets that have these rocks. One day, we might find life or an environment with water that can sustain human life.

A final example of what studying space rocks can do for us is that it can help prepare for the future. Although it might seem like a long way off, at some point, we might harvest space rocks as a resource like we gather wood from trees now. Many space rocks have gases and chemical compounds in them that are rare or potentially not found on Earth. In the future, we might use these resources to create new technology that's useful to people on Earth. We might use space rocks to further our exploration of the Solar System, possibly by using them to develop rocket fuel.
