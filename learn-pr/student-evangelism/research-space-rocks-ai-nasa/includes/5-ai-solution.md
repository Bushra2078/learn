Integrating AI into this process can improve the collection process for both humans and rovers. For example, we could send astronauts to the moon armed with a computer that can take photos of rocks. The computer could tell the astronaut what type of rock it likely is. The computer could let astronauts know whether the rock would be a valuable contribution to our current collection of space rocks. This computer could be placed in a rover that could autonomously drive across the surface of the moon and scan for rocks that we need for research.

By integrating AI, astronauts could more quickly and accurately locate and identify rocks they should bring back to Earth. The computer also could collect metadata like location, temperature, and light exposure. With accuracy feedback from astronauts and scientists on Earth, the AI model used to identify valuable rocks would be improved over time. 

## AI on Earth

As we mentioned earlier, AI performs better when the sample data is cleaner. We mean not only when the rocks are physically clean, but when the photos of the rocks are similar in lighting (and therefore, the visual coloring of the rock is consistent), when edges between the rock and the background are clean and consistent, and each photo has a clear indication of scale. An AI model that would help identify, classify, and track these samples would provide clear instructions for how to take the photos to fit the current model.

## The future of AI in space 

Although AI and image quality might not be good enough today to take a satellite image of a planet's surface and give an overview of the types of rocks that are on it, we can start to understand where AI *can* help and where it's limited.
