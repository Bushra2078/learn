As we mentioned earlier, a prominent place to gather space rocks (e.g., meterorites) is actually on Earth. But, while planned missions try to gather specific types of space rocks, on Earth, we are at the mercy of the type of meteorite that happens to crash onto the surface of our planet. Furthermore, meteorites are covered with a fusion crust, (burnt crust formed when the meteor travls through our atmosphere) that covers the rock. The fusion crust makes it difficult to identify what type of meteorite it is until it is brought to the lab to be cleaned and analyzed.

## Where space rocks are found

Hot and cold deserts (e.g., NW-Africa and Antarctica) are major spots for finding meteorites that have crashed into Earth, but they might be found anywhere around the globe. Antarctica is a great location to search for meteorites because the black color of the fusion crust stands out well against the blue glacier ice. In other areas, meteorites might be obscured by vegetation, they might blend in with the ground, or they might even look like other common rocks or debris in the area.

Antarctica also offers a unique, constant, dry, and cold climate that helps preserve the organic chemicals in space rocks. In other areas, shifts in temperature and precipitation, along with the impact of humans in the area, makes the rock sample less likely to be preserved over time. In meteorite research, ideally, the rock is as preserved as possible for a clearer understanding of its original composition.
