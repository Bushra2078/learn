As we mentioned earlier, a prominent place to gather space rocks, including meteorites, is actually on Earth. Although planned missions try to collect specific types of space rocks, on Earth, we're at the mercy of meteoroids that happen to crash onto the surface of our planet, and which we experience on Earth as meteorites. (A *meteoroid* is a rocky or metallic projectile flying through space. A meteoroid becomes a *meteor* when it enters Earth's atmosphere. A meteor becomes a *meteorite* when it hits the earth's surface.) Furthermore, meteorites found on Earth are covered with a fusion crustâ€”a burnt crust that's formed when the meteor travels through the Earth's atmosphere. The fusion crust that covers meteorites and space rocks makes it difficult to identify the type of rock until it's brought to the lab to be cleaned and analyzed.

## Where space rocks are found

Although meteorites might be found anywhere on our planet, hot and cold deserts like those found in Northwest Africa and Antarctica are major spots for finding meteorites. Antarctica is a good location to search for meteorites because the black color of the fusion crust stands out against blue glacier ice. In other areas, meteorites might be obscured by vegetation, blend in with the ground, or look like other common rocks or debris in the area.

Antarctica also offers a unique, constant, dry, and cold climate that helps preserve the organic chemicals in meteorites. In other areas, shifts in temperature and precipitation, along with the impact of humans in the area, make the rock sample less likely to be preserved over time. In meteorite research, a high degree of preservation gives us a clearer understanding of the rock's original composition.
