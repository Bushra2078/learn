- A *meteoroid* flying through space becomes a *meteor* when it enters Earth's atmosphere.
- A meteor becomes a *meteorite* when it hits the Earth's surface.

Astronauts have some challenges to overcome when gathering space rocks for their research, but solutions are available.
AI is one of the solutions and the technology is improving every day.

The NASA OSIRIS-REx mission gathers regolith space rock samples from the asteroid *Bennu*. The mission equipment captures high-quality photos while in orbit. The photos are sent to rock experts on Earth, who analyze features of the photos to gain information about our Solar System.
