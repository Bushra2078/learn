Many space missions have taken astronauts and rovers into space to search for space rocks. One of these missions is the [OSIRIS-Rex mission](https://www.asteroidmission.org/objectives/?azure-portal=true).

The OSIRIS-Rex mission consists of launching a rocket to orbit an asteroid named Bennu. Bennu's regolith space rock might record the earliest history of our solar system. The OSIRIS-Rex mission is all about finding out more about where humans came from and what our destiny is.

The OSIRIS-Rex mission is unique compared to the other types of missions that we have talked. The OSIRIS-Rex isn't actually going to touch down on the asteroid. Instead, it will take high-quality photos while it is in orbit. The photos will be sent to rock experts on Earth, who will analyze features of the photos that might give us information about our solar system.
