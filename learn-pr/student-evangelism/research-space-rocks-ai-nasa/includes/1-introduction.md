As technology advances, many disciplines outside the field of computer science have found ways to introduce advanced technologies into their work. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a relatively new technology that's being applied to many tasks.

This Microsoft Learn learning path is the second in a series of learning paths that highlight how AI might influence NASA research and space exploration in general. From teaching a computer to detect which rock an astronaut should pick up based on the type of rock it is to predicting whether a rocket will be able to launch on a certain day, AI can be a useful tool for the brilliant research minds that are behind some of Earth's most inspiring discoveries.

The services and libraries that do a lot of the complex math and algorithms around AI are widely available. For example, numerous Python libraries and packages explore, visualize, and analyze data, such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/?azure-portal=true), and [Azure offers AI services](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/?azure-portal=true) to analyze images with a simple API call.

Although there are complexities and levels we won't cover in the Microsoft Learn modules, this learning path introduces you to some basic AI tools and services. It guides you through a practical use of the tools and services for an introductory exploration of images of moon rocks.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll use AI to build an aid to moon rock classification techniques. Along the way, you'll:

- Learn what space rocks are and what we do with them.
- Learn why classifying space rocks is challenging and important.

## Prerequisites

- Some Python experience
