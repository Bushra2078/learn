  questions:
    - content: How does Azure Function know how to find your compiled app?
      choices:
        - content: You set `defaultExecutablePath` in the file _host.json_
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You should set `defaultExecutablePath` in the _function.json_ file for that endpoint.
        - content: You set the `executionPath` property in the function endpoints _function.json_ file.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The property is called `defaultExecutionPath`.
        - content: You set `defaultExecutablePath` in the _function.json_ for the function endpoint.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. That's the correct place to point out the compiled app path.
    - content: Any any language or runtime can use custom handlers
      choices:
        - content: Yes, there are no limitations.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The selected language or runtime needs to support HTTP primitives.
        - content: As long as it supports HTTP primitives.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A runtime or language supporting HTTP primitives can be used to create Azure Functions.
        - content: Only languages with a first-class support. 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The whole point with custom handlers is to support languages and runtimes that doesn't have first-class support.
