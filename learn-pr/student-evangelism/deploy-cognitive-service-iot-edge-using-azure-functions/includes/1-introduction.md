 Azure Functions enable you to deploy cognitive services on edge devices. You build your solution in the cloud as snippets of code and the logic is deployed on to edge devices through azure functions.  

Suppose you work as a product designer for a company that makes digital signage equipment to be deployed at bus stops. Your company wants to create a new type of signs for bus stops. The digital sign displays information about health and safety for tourists. The original sign is in English, but the tourist can speak at the sign in any of the specified languages – and the sign will display the text in that language. Previously, this facility was not possible to implement easily – but due to recent health issues, it has become imperative to display these signs. The company needs to make the interactive digital signs such that they can cater to a large number of markets by changing the target language.

In this module, you'll deploy a cognitive speech service to an IoT Edge device using Azure Functions to make the IoT Edge device as a language translator. Your device records a voice in a foreign language and the cognitive service will convert the speech to a custom target language. You will specify the target language in the module. You will use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to create and deploy a function. The function will run based on receiving an HTTP request. This request will trigger Azure Functions and initiate code execution. The code will use Speech APIs to translate the voice into the target language.  The translated text is displayed on the screen of the IoT device. By the end of this module, you’ll be able to deploy a cognitive translator application using Azure Functions on to an IoT Edge using VS Code.
