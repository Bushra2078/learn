A text completion is a single completion containing a prompt and a response. A chat completion is a series of prompts and completions. Chat completions allow you to simulate a conversation with a model, which helps the model to produce more natural and accurate responses.

Large language models (LLMs) can produce unexpected or unwanted responses to prompts as a result of:

- Insufficient information in the training data.
- Insufficient context in the prompt.
- Lack of capability of the model itself.
- Hostile intent by the user providing the prompt (*jailbreaking*).

In the context of a chat completion, each of these issues are problems that we need to address, and the good news is that we can address them and we'll as part of this module.

## Scenario: Update your chat bot

Your company is running a chat bot using an LLM, a large language model. To ensure the LLM is responding accurately, you need to ensure the model is using your company's data. You're looking to evaluate strategies to do so.

## What will you learn?

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Create a chat completion.
- Explain how a chat completion works to produce a better response.
- Protect your model, and chat, from bad actors.  

## What is the main objective?

Use chat completions via the Azure OpenAI Studio playground.
