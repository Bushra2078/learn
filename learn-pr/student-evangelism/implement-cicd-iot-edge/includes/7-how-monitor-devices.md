Monitoring enables us to do long-running tests against edge modules, and provide real-time alerts using Application Insights. Our EdgeSolution includes a dockerappinsights module, which is configured in [deployment.template.json](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-oxford-implement-cicd-iot-edge/blob/master/EdgeSolution/deployment.template.json). This module monitors the docker host of each containerized Azure IoT Edge device. If a device has been deployed and is running, you can monitor it. View the Application Insights resource that was deployed previously.
