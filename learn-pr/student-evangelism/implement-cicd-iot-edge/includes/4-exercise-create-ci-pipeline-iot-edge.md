## Create Azure resources

Azure DevOps Projects creates a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps. You firstly will need to create cloud services that will be used for the module.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Click on the **Deploy to Azure** button below.
   [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoftDocs%2Fmslearn-oxford-implement-cicd-iot-edge%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)

3. On the web page, provide required information.

   1. Select **directory**.
   2. Select your **subscription**.
   3. Select **Create New** for **resource group**.
   4. Create a **resource group name** or keep it as default.
   5. Provide a globally unique value for the **Resource Name Suffix** parameter.

4. Review and deploy your resources to Azure.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you encounter any issues in the deployment, it is advised to delete the created resource group (if any) and retry with a new value for the **Resource Name Suffix** parameter.

5. Go to the Azure portal to review your resources.

## Create an Azure DevOps project

1. If you don't have an Azure DevOps organization, you should follow the steps to create one for free.

   1. Open [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines) and choose **Start free**.
   1. Sign in/up with Microsoft.
   1. Give a name to your organization and create it.

2. Create a new project in your organization. Give it a descriptive name, and you can choose private or public. Then it will take you to the **Overview** page of your project.

3. Navigate to **Repos**, and then click the **Import** button underneath **Import a repository** and provide this URL:

   ```
   https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-oxford-implement-cicd-iot-edge.git
   ```

4. Begin the import process of the repository into your Azure DevOps project.

## Create a CI pipeline

This repository contains an Azure DevOps build definition, which is preconfigured to build the included EdgeSolution in [azure-pipelines.yml](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-oxford-implement-cicd-iot-edge/blob/master/.azure-pipelines.yml). This build definition relies on an external plugin called [Replace Tokens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qetza.replacetokens).

1. Begin by installing the **Replace Tokens** task from the Visual Studio Marketplace by visiting [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) and clicking the **Get it free** button. Then install into the organization that contains your newly created Azure DevOps project.

2. Once this task is successfully installed, return to the Azure DevOps project and select **Repos** > **Files**. Then edit the `.azure-pipelines.yml` file.

3. Add the following comment to the top of the file, as shown below.

   ```
   # This repository is built using Azure DevOps.
   ```

   ![This illustration shows how to edit an Azure pipeline.](../media/edit-pipeline.png)

4. Commit your change and go back to **Files**.

5. Set up the build. You should see that a build has kicked off upon editing the build definition.

6. Go to **Pipelines**. You will see the build will fail. This is to be expected, as Azure DevOps will create the build definition with a name that contains spaces, which cause a conflict in the "Azure IoT Edge - Build module images" task. To fix this, select **Pipelines** > **Builds** > **Rename**, and then rename the newly created build definition so that it does not contain spaces.

### Create build definition variables

1. Now you need to add build variables in order to run the build successfully. You'll need to obtain:

   - Azure Container Registry host name as `acr.host`
   - Azure Container Registry username as `acr.user`
   - Azure Container Registry password as `acr.password`

2. Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the resource group you created for this module.

3. Select a Container Registry resource and go to **Access keys** under **Settings**.

4. Copy the name of the login server, username, and password.

   ![The illustration shows the access keys of Container Registry.](../media/access-keys.png)

5. Obtain the Application Insights instrumentation key, which will be represented by `appinsights.instrumentationkey`.

6. Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the resource group you created for this module.

7. Select **Application Insights** and copy the **Instrumentation Key** information in the **Overview** page.

   ![The illustration shows the instrumentation key of Application Insights.](../media/instrumentation-key.png)

8. Go back to Azure DevOps project and navigate to **Pipelines**.

9. Select the pipeline you ran earlier and edit the pipeline. Click **Variables** and start adding new variables.

    ![The illustration shows adding new variables to the pipeline.](../media/add-variables.png)

10. When you add four variables above with values, save and run the pipeline.

11. You review the status of the pipeline by going back to **Pipelines**. The build should finish successfully as shown below.

    ![The illustration shows a successful build.](../media/successful-build.png)

### Apply a branch policy

1. With a successful build definition in place, we can now enforce continuous integration by applying a branch policy to the master branch. Start with selecting **Repos** > **Branches**. Then click **...** on the row for the master branch and select **Branch policies**.

2. Navigate to the build validation, click **Add build policy**, and select the newly created build pipeline. Keep everything as default and then click the **Save** button.

   ![The illustration shows the branch policy added for the pipeline.](../media/branch-policy.png)

   While this policy is enabled, all commits to feature branches will kick off an execution of the newly created build pipeline. It must succeed in order for a pull request of those changes to be made to the master branch.
