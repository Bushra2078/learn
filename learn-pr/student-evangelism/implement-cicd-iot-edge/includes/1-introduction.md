Suppose you work as an Engineer responsible for deploying production software to IoT Edge devices. Your job involves creating the final software code release of your product. Your IoT solution has expanded considerably. Previously, you had a small number of devices of the same type located in the same geography. Now, you are deploying to thousands of different IoT devices spread across a wider geography. Your product has also evolved. The company has expanded, and your software release now includes code from a larger number of developers.  To build this release pipeline, you must integrate code from various members of the development team.

Because it is expensive to deploy to diverse physical IoT devices, your team has tasked you with creating a process for ‘smoke testing’ the solution. Smoke testing checks the core functionality of a program. A successful smoke test ensures that the program is ready for further testing. By using a smoke test for IoT devices, you can create a baseline for the core functionality.  If the smoke test for the solution on IoT devices fails, your team can concentrate on fixing the identified issues. This avoids expensive rework with more sophisticated tests, optimizing the time for your developer and the test teams.
Hence, you need to create a smoke test as a subset of your main functionality. The test should be self-scoring and automated. It should be capable of running on virtual IoT devices so that your team can save costs by avoiding the use of physical IoT devices.   Also, the test should incorporate the principles of DevOps (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) for IoT Edge devices. Hence, you want to automate the entire process end-to-end. Your smoke-testing strategy should incorporate code from developers and run it on virtual IoT Edge devices in an automated manner.
