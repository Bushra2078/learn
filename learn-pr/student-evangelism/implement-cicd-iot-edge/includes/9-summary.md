Without smoke tests for IoT Edge devices, you risk expensive and time consuming rework by the development and testing teams.

The smoke-testing strategy integrated code from developers and deployed the solution to a virtual Azure IoT Edge device. Azure DevOps was used to implement a CI/CD-based release pipeline with a smoke test. A containerized virtual device was created. A smoke test was implemented for this device. The results of the smoke test were captured using Application Insights.

You used a CI/CD strategy to implement the smoke test on an IoT Edge device. This solution seamlessly incorporated code from a large number of developers.
