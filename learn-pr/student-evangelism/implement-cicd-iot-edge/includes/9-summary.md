You used a CI/CD strategy to implement the smoke test on an IoT Edge device. This solution seamlessly incorporated code from a large number of developers. Without smoke tests for IoT Edge devices, you risk expensive and time-consuming rework by the development and testing teams.

The smoke test integrates the code from developers, and then deploys the solution to a virtual Azure IoT Edge device. You implemented a CI/CD release pipeline. Smoke tests were created on a containerized virtual device.
