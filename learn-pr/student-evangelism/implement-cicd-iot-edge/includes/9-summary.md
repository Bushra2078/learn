Without smoke tests for IoT Edge devices, you risk expensive and time consuming rework by the development and testing teams.

The smoke test integrates the code from developers and then deploys the solution to a virtual Azure IoT Edge device. Azure DevOps was used to implement a CI/CD-based release pipeline. Smoke tests were created on a containerized virtual device. The results of the smoke test were captured using Application Insights.

You used a CI/CD strategy to implement the smoke test on an IoT Edge device. This solution seamlessly incorporated code from a large number of developers.
