Without smoke tests for IoT Edge devices, there is potential for expensive and time consuming rework by the development and testing teams.

To create a smoke-testing strategy you integrated code from developers and deployed the solution to a virtual Azure IoT Edge device. Your solution used Azure DevOps to implement a CI/CD-based release pipeline with a smoke test. A containerized virtual device was created. A smoke test was implemented for this device. The results of the smoke test were captured using Application Insights.

You used a CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) strategy to implement the smoke test on IoT Edge device. This solution was able to seamlessly incorporate code from a large number of developers.
