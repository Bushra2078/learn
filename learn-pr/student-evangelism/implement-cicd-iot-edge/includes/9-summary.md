Without smoke tests for IoT Edge devices, you risk expensive and time consuming rework by the development and testing teams.

The smoke test integrated code from developers and deployed the solution to a virtual Azure IoT Edge device. Azure DevOps was used to implement a CI/CD-based release pipeline. A containerized virtual device was created along with smoke tests. The results of the smoke test were captured using Application Insights.

You used a CI/CD strategy to implement the smoke test on an IoT Edge device. This solution seamlessly incorporated code from a large number of developers.
