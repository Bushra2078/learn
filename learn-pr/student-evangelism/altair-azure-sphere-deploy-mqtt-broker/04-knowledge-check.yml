quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "The advantage of running a private MQTT broker include?"
    choices:
    - content: "It’s much simpler than using the public test.mosquitto.org public broker."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Setting up an MQTT broker is more complex than using the public broker, but a private MQTT broker is secure and performance is more predictable."
    - content: "It is secure, private, and performance is predicable. The virtual disk server performs faster when running on the same server as the MQTT broker."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Altair emulator including the virtual disk server will perform better when connected to a private MQTT broker."
    - content: "The private MQTT broker is not security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You use self signed certificates to secure the MQTT broker and all MQTT messages between the Altair emulator are encrypted and private."
  - content: "The advantage of installing the virtual disk server on the same server as the MQTT broker is?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Altair virtual disk drive B: will be faster as there is one less network hop for each disk sector to be read or written."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Altair virtual disk drive B: will be faster as there is one less network hop for each disk sector to be read or written."
    - content: "The virtual disk server cannot be run on the same server as the MQTT broker."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The virtual disk server can be run on the same server as the MQTT broker. The Altair virtual disk drive B will be faster as there is one less network hop for each disk sector to be read or written."
    - content: "The virtual disk server runs on one of the Azure Sphere’s real-time cores."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The virtual server disk cache runs on one of the Azure Sphere’s real-time cores. The virtual disk server can be run on the same server as the MQTT broker. The Altair virtual disk drive B: will be faster as there is one less network hop for each disk sector to be read or written."
  - content: "What best describes the virtual disk server?"
    choices:
    - content: "The virtual disk server extends the Altair emulator by providing read/write disk support for your applications running on CP/M."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When the virtual disk server is running and it will provide a virtual disk that is accessible as drive B: from CP/Mon the Altair emulator. The virtual disk cache running on one of the Azure Sphere real-time cores will significantly import the performance of the virtual disk server."
    - content: "The virtual disk server can only be run on your desktop."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The virtual disk server can run on your desktop or in a cloud based virtual machine. Ideally run the virtual disk server and the MQTT broker in the same machine."
    - content: "The virtual disk server runs on the Azure Sphere to provide read/write storage for your CP/M applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The virtual disk server runs on either your desktop or in a cloud based virtual machine."
