Imagine that you've been tasked with collecting information about U.S. airports and answering some basic questions using the data for a large travel agency. You need to identify data points such as how many airports are present in each state and cities that have the most airports. The task will involve downloading some data, organizing it, and then pulling key pieces of information from it.

Over lunch, one of your colleagues said you should build a Python app and told you how great the Python programming language is for processing data. You've done some basic programming in the past with languages such as Java and C#, but Python is pretty new to you so you decide to try it out on this project and learn a little bit about the language and how to build a simple app to process data with it.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create a Python-based Jupyter notebook in Azure Notebooks
- Download a data file from a U.S. Government web site
- Load the data file into the notebook and read its contents with Python
- Parse the data and extract information from it to create the needed results
