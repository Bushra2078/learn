Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Created in the early 1990s, it enjoys a wide range of uses from automating repetitive tasks and writing Web applications to building machine learning models and implementing neural networks. Researchers, mathematicians, and data scientists in particular like Python because of its rich and easy-to-understand syntax and the wide range of open-source packages available. Packages are commonly used, shared code libraries that are freely available for anyone to use.

Python has a simple, easy to learn syntax which emphasizes readability. Applications written in Python can run on almost any computer, including those running Windows, macOS, and popular distributions of Linux. Furthermore, the ecosystem contains a rich set of development tools for writing, debugging, and publishing Python applications. Finally, Python is supported by an active user community that is eager to help new programmers learn the [Pythonic way](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/) where you don't just get the syntax right, but use the language the way it was intended.

## Running Python code

Python is an interpreted language which reduces the edit-test-debug cycle because there's no compilation step required. In order to run Python apps, you need a runtime environment/interpreter to execute the code. Here are a few of the options available.

- The most popular is the traditional implementation (nicknamed "CPython"), available from the [Python website](https://www.python.org). There are install packages for Windows and macOS. Linux users can install Python using built-in package managers such as **apt**, **yum**, and **Zypper**. There is also an online playground where you can try Python statements right on the website.

- You can download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), which is a specialized Python distribution tailored for scientific programming tasks such as data science and machine learning.

- The [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) includes the command-line Python tools as part of the pre-installed environment. You can type `python` right in the shell to open an interactive Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL).

- [IronPython](https://ironpython.net/) is an open-source implementation of Python built on the .NET runtime.

- [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) provides a web-based interactive programming environment that supports a variety of programming languages, including Python. Jupyter notebooks are widely used in research and academia for mathematical modeling, machine learning, statistical analysis, and for teaching and learning how to code.

Next, we'll explore a free variation of the Jupyter notebook approach.
