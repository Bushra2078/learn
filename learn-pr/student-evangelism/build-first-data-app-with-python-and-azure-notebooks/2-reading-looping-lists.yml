quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What is the purpose of using `with` statements when opening files?"
    choices:
    - content: "It prevents you from having to specify the full path to a file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You still have to provide a file path to `open`, regardless of whether `with` is used."
    - content: "It prevents you from having to explicitly close the files that you open."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When the end of the `with` block is reached, the file is closed, even if you don't explicitly call the `close` function."
    - content: "`for` loops that read file contents do not work without `with` statements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`for` loops work with or without `with` statements."
    - content: "`with` statements automatically parse JSON strings into Python objects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`with` has nothing to do with parsing."
  - content: "True or false: Indenting your code is optional in Python, but it enhances readability."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Python uses indentations to determine where blocks of code begin and end."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Python uses indentations to determine where blocks of code begin and end."
  - content: "Which of the following statements returns a list containing all but the first three items in a list named `items`?"
    choices:

    - content: "items.slice(3)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement returns the first three items in the list."
    - content: "items[3:]"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This statement returns all but the first three items in the list."
    - content: "items[:3]"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement returns the first three items in the list."
