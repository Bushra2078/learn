Congratulations!

We're excited to see what you created through this ideation session. This exercise taught some basic prompt creation techniques, highlighted some Bing Chat capabilities, and provided a introduction to the capabilities of Generative AI, whether it be completion, transformation, conversation or summarizing.
With this brilliant idea already fleshed out, next step would be for you to execute and bring the idea to reality.
