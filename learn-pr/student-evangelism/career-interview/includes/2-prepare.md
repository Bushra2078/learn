As a software developer, you are likely to encounter more than one type of interview. Depending on the type of interview, you need to prepare differently. Different types of interviews assess your tech skill level and analyze your ability to function in a team. Candidates often spend all their time honing their technical skills yet working in teams and collaborating with people from many disciplines will be crucial!

## Types of interviews

Depending on the size of the company, you might go through as few as two and as many as ten interviews. Some companies are able to carry out most interviews in one or two days while others take more time. When being interviewed, it's important that you know what types of interviews exist and how to best prepare for them. The type of interviews that exist include:

- **Human Resources**. Early in the interview cycle, you will have a talk with someone representing recruiting which is typically part of Human Resources, HR. Here you have the chance to ask questions on broader things you want to know about company culture, pay, benefits, and other practical information. If this happens in the beginning of the cycle, ask as many questions as you can as it helps you prepare for what's next.  

- **Coding interview**. In this interview, you are tested on your coding skills. There might be more than one of this type of interview and it can take the form of a take home test or questions over the phone. There will probably also be  a face-to-face version of this interview where you either get asked new questions or are asked to explain code you've already written in a previous step. The people carrying out these interviews might be future colleagues from your intended team or from another team.

- **System design**. If you are a little more senior, you are likely to encounter an interview type where your ability to design systems is assessed. The idea is to evaluate whether you understand how to build more complex applications that may have dependencies on other systems.

- **Manager**. You are likely to have an interview with a prospective manager. This is a chance for both you and a manager to assess one another. The manager wants to see if you are someone who would add value to the team. On the other hand, you should evaluate if this manager is someone with whom you'd like to work.

## Preparing for the tech interviews

No two tech companies are the same, so knowing how to prepare for different interview processes can be tricky. In general, interviews can be divided into two major groups:

- **Algorithm focused**. This type of interview involves tasks where you are asked to implement things like binary trees, shortest path problems and so on.

- **Enterprise focused**. Some technical interviews are focused on enterprise software, so called line-of-business applications or LOB. Challenges might revolve around maintaining applications, refactoring old code, and the interview focus is less on performance and more on integrating systems.

So, how can you guess the kind of interview your prospective company will assign? You can do research to discover your target position's expectations. You should also ask your recruiter what to expect and if they have materials to help you prepare.  

## Algorithm focused

> What does an interview that focuses on algorithm challenges look for?

In this type of interview, you are given a specific problem and you are expected to do two things. First, you need to select an appropriate algorithm for the problem. Next, you need to understand its limitations and understand what happens when it scales. The concept of _scaling_ implies that when the input to a function increases, your algorithm should perform well. Algorithm performance is denoted as O(n), also known as Big O notation. You can consult a variety of web sites to understand how to calculate Big O.

You will be asked about algorithms and their performance to get an idea of your grasp of software performance and, more importantly, your ability to explain it.

### Preparing for algorithmic interview

> How can I practice for this type of interview?

Many existing sites are dedicated to interview preparation. In fact, many recruiters recommend preparing for the interviews by using some of the below platforms and practice problems:

- [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com) 
- [Coderbyte](https://www.coderbyte.com)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
- [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

These platforms offer many problems to try to solve and will let you use different programming languages to do so. Usually you get assessed on how well you solved something, which means a solution that simply _works_ receives a lower score than one that is optimal.

> [!TIP]
> It's worth bookmarking some of the above sites for later study.

### Additional practice - books

Another way to practice includes well-known books which contain both sample interview questions and their solutions as well as strategies for interview success. Here are some examples:

- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell 

- [A curated list of algorithm books](https://hackernoon.com/10-data-structure-algorithms-books-every-programmer-should-read-d50487313127) 

GitHub has become a great source of knowledge on preparing for tech interviews as well. Here are some popular repositories:

- [Coding interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) 

- [Free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) 

- [The algorithms, Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) 

## Enterprise focused

Companies more focused on line-of business apps using legacy systems have a different interview process that requires a different type of preparation.

Working as a software engineer at a company like this entails that you know how to manage code written in different styles and frameworks. You might need to change it into something more manageable, known as _refactoring_, or to maintain it as it is by fixing bugs and adding features. Integrating one or many applications with one another using various techniques like import jobs, message queues and so on is also an important aspect of the job.  

The skill set needed to work with such code is different. You might not need to focus on writing the most performant algorithm but you do need to understand architectural patterns and when to use given patterns.

### Preparing for enterprise code interview

To prepare for these types of interviews, you need to read up on patterns. It's also a good idea to look up something called 'Katas'. Katas, whose name is derived from karate, are exercises that help you practice solving common problems. By practicing a specific exercise, you learn the exercise, and, over time, you learn how to solve it better. This way of practicing builds a skill that you are ideally able to put into use in your everyday life as a coder. Katas are not for beginners only, but for anyone looking to hone their skills in the industry.

Below is a list of links regarding these two topics:

- [Software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8) by Erich Gamma et al. 

- [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) by Martin Fowler.

## Context matters

Another thing to consider when preparing for a tech interview is that some companies will let you program a problem in your language of choice but others want you to use a specific language or framework. To prepare for such interviews, you need to read up on how to best "do things" in a language or framework.  For example, for JavaScript you are likely to get questions on how the language works and its patterns, but for .NET you might be asked how to solve problems given the framework.

### How to prepare for context?

You can usually use a search engine to find the most common questions asked for a programming language or framework. Here are some links for JavaScript: 

- [37 JavaScript questions](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions) 

- [85 JavaScript questions](https://www.guru99.com/javascript-interview-questions-answers.html) 

A great way to prepare for questions about a given language or framework is to implement many small projects that will make you learn things in a better way. Here are some suggestions: 

- [40 JavaScript projects to build](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)

- [Web Dev For Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners). 24 lessons with exercises. Seven major projects and available in 11+ languages.

## Reach out

Spend as much time as possible preparing by trying to solve various problems but also don't be afraid to reach out to the recruiter or recruitment team and ask for guidelines and materials. Some companies actually offer interview coaches. Having these kind of materials can help you focus on what this company believes is important. Some companies will send "how to prepare" material to the candidate; however, it is not recommended that you reach out proactively to ask for interview preparation materials if you do not receive them from the company.

> [!TIP]
> Be brave! Ask for guidance and preparation content. Doing so shows interest and might increase the likelihood that you pass the interview.

## General guidelines

Now that you hopefully have some bookmarks for resources, lets focus on some general guidelines. By remembering and following these guidelines, during the interview, you'll be seen as a good candidate with a great attitude.

> [!NOTE]
> While it's great to prepare as much as possible for a technical interview, don't forget about how to behave while at the interview. Mind your manners! In addition, you have the right to expect a certain behavior from the company during your interview. Even if you're a star at algorithms, behaving poorly might lead you to not be hired.  

- **Account for Work history**. Ensure that your work history is accounted for. If you have a gap in your resume, ensure that there's a reasonable explanation for it. This is something you can bring up at the interview and the company is likely to ask, so ensure you have answers prepared.

- **Avoid speaking ill of former employers**. While it is understandable that you found friction at a workplace you would like to leave, it's best not to bring this up in an interview. If you have to bring it up, ensure that you are speaking about it as a moment that helped you grow as a person rather than as a negative experience.

- **Be professional**. Always come to your interview on time. Even if the traffic is bad and you are delayed, email or call the interviewer to alert them.

- **Convey being a team player**. Being a developer is about being a team player. As such, you should make it clear in an interview that you understand that you didn't deliver a big project by yourself. Explain your role in it but try not to boast. Be humble but confident.
