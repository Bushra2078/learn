An interview is usually the last step before being offered a job.

You're likely to go through a number of them with an organization. Additionally, there are different types of interviews with different expectations.

As a software developer, you will encounter interviews that not only test your technical skills but also your ability to clearly communicate. Your soft skills will also be appraised.

Remember, the interview process goes both ways.  While the company is assessing you through the interview process, you should also use this time to evaluate the company culture and whether the company or team is the right place for you and your career goals.
