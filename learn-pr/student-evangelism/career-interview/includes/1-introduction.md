An interview is usually the last step before you're offered a job. You're likely to go through a number of them with an organization. There are different types of interviews, with different expectations.

As a software developer, you'll encounter interviews that test not only your technical skills but also your ability to communicate clearly. Interviewers will also appraise your interpersonal skills.

Remember, the interview process goes both ways. While the company is assessing you through the interview process, you should also use that time to evaluate whether the company or team is the right place for you and your career goals.

## Learning objectives

After you finish this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the types of interviews that you might encounter.
- Prepare for your interviews by practicing.
- Identify how and when to follow up after an interview.
