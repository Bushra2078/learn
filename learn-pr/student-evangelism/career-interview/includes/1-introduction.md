Congratulations on landing the interview! What are your next steps? When it comes to interviews, it is helpful to understand the different phases of the process that, depending on your performance, can impact the outcome.

An interview is usually the last step before being offered a job.

You're likely to go through a number of them with an organization. Additionally, there are different types of interviews with different expectations. 

As a software developer, you will encounter interviews that not only test your technical skills but also your ability to clearly communicate. Your soft skills will also be appraised.
