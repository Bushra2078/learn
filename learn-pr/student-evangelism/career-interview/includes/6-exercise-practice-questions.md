In this exercise, we will be looking at how to answer questions. By practicing how you answer, you learn to structure your thoughts and will hopefully be perceived in a favorable way.

## Set a time for practice

Practice makes perfect. By setting a time on a regular interval, you improve through repetition. Answering questions is no different:

Schedule time each day before your interview, to practice some of these questions in front of a mirror or with a friend.

   ```output
   For example, decide to practice interview questions each day between 5pm-6pm.
   ```

## Select your topic

There are many types of questions you can practice like for example:

- Code questions, on algorithm or architecture.
- Soft skill question on how you would act in a certain situation.

Take an example of some code you have written and challenge yourself to explain it verbally in five minutes.

   > Take a parser for a calculator and explain what the task was, what were the challenges, and how you approached them.

## Structure your answer

It's a challenge to come off clear and to the point. To practice clarity, use a structure where you identify certain key points you want to get across but also in what order you want to tell it. Here's how you can structure your answer:

Practice structuring your explanation minute by minute:

- Here is the problem that this code is designed to solve
- Here is how I went about deciding how to build it
- Here is a challenge I faced when building it
- Here is how I solved the challenge
- Here is what I learned by completing this code

Select a problem and use the above template for describing it:

Here's an example output:

   > The problem:
   > The task was about designing a calculator. The input is taken from the command line.
   > First I needed to find out if there was any considerations like what operators it should support and how the input happens, if numbers and operators are input separately.
   >
   > Answer: Input is in the form of an expression `1 + 1`
   >
   > How I decided:
   > I started by writing a test, the test helped me verify when the code would eventually work but would also help me consider edge cases.
   >
   > Knowing the input was an expression meant, that I needed to divide the expression into tokens, numbers and operators. Then I needed to encode in which order operators should be applied to solve an expression like `2 * (3+2)`. Finally I needed to perform the calculation.
   >
   > Challenge:
   > The challenge was in realizing how to parse the tokens, selecting a data structure to store the expression and then compute said expression.
   >
   > How I solved it:
   > I decided on a Binary Tree as data structure with operators as top nodes and the values as leaves. Then I could compute the expression via recursion.
   >
   > What I learned:
   > I learned the importance of always starting with a test and gradually build out the test suite with happy paths and edge cases. Additionally I learned that selecting an appropriate data structure is key to solving the problem in a straight forward way.

## Pay attention to body language

Another important part of communication is body language, how things are said and what inflections used, can make a significant difference in how you are perceived.

Challenge yourself to observe your body language as you speak, and try to ensure that you always look confident in your answers.

   > Pay attention to whether you are sitting or standing with a straight back. Relax your posture and don't have hands in your pockets. Look the interviewers in the eyes.
