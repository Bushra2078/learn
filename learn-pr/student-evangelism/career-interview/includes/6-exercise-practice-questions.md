In this exercise, we'll look at how to answer questions. By practicing how you answer, you learn to structure your thoughts and will hopefully be perceived in a favorable way.

## Set a time for practice

Practice makes perfect. You improve through repetition. Schedule time each day before your interview to practice some questions in front of a mirror or with a friend.

> For example, decide to practice interview questions each day between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM.

## Select your topic

There are many types of questions that you can practice. For example:

- Code questions about algorithm or architecture
- Questions about how you would act in a certain situation

Take an example of some code you've written and challenge yourself to explain it verbally in five minutes.

> For example, take a parser for a calculator and explain what the task was, what the challenges were, and how you approached those challenges.

## Structure your answer

It's a challenge to be clear and to the point. To practice clarity, use a structure where you identify key points that you want to make and the order in which you want to make them. 

Practice structuring your explanation minute by minute. Select a problem and use the following template to describe it:

- Here's the problem that this code is designed to solve.
- Here's how I went about deciding how to build it.
- Here's a challenge I faced when building it.
- Here's how I solved the challenge.
- Here's what I learned by completing this code.

Here's an example output:

> The problem:
> The task was about designing a calculator. The input is taken from the command line.
> First I needed to find out if there were any considerations like what operators it should support and how the input happens, if numbers and operators are input separately.
>
> Answer: Input is in the form of an expression `1 + 1`
>
> How I decided:
> I started by writing a test. The test would help me verify when the code would eventually work but would also help me consider edge cases. 
>
> Knowing the input was an expression meant that I needed to divide the expression into tokens, numbers, and operators. Then I needed to encode in which order operators should be applied to solve an expression like `2 * (3+2)`. Finally, I needed to perform the calculation.
>
> Challenge:
> The challenge was in realizing how to parse the tokens, selecting a data structure to store the expression and then computing the expression.
>
> How I solved it:
> I decided on a binary tree as data structure with the operators as top nodes and the values as leaves. Then I could compute the expression via recursion.
>
> What I learned:
> I learned the importance of always starting with a test and gradually building out the test suite with happy paths and edge cases. I also learned that selecting an appropriate data structure is key to solving the problem in a straightforward way. 

## Pay attention to your body language

Another important part of communication is body language. How you say things and what your inflections are can make a big difference in how you're perceived.

Challenge yourself to observe your body language as you speak. Try to ensure that you always look confident in your answers.

> Pay attention to whether you're sitting or standing with a straight back. Don't have hands in your pockets. Look the interviewers in the eyes.
