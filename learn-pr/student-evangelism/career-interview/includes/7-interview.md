So much for the tech interview. While that is an important one, the other interviews, the non-tech ones are what might settle it. Do great here and you might out compete someone with longer experience, or better education on paper.

## Culture questions

You will get questions to see how much of a team player you are. For example, you might get asked about your strengths and weaknesses and how you would handle a conflict. Both those questions are hard to answer. Strengths are easy to list but what about weaknesses? Do I really want to let an employer know my weaknesses?

> Turn a weakness into a strength.

The way to answer that question is to talk about a moment where you learned about an area where you can improve and how you grew from the process. You can think out such an answer ahead of time as it's a common question to get.

What about conflict resolution? This question is often difficult to answer. Point to a situation in the past that speaks to your ability to listen to other people's perspectives and celebrate diversity of thought while coming to a favorable resolution.  

> Do you have any questions for me?

It's easy to think, as a beginner, that this is a question you can just answer by saying "no, no questions." In fact, this is where you should show your enthusiasm and preparedness. The more positive and enthusiastic you come across, the more likely you are to land the role, given that your tech tests are good enough. Having questions prepared for your interviewer is crucial. Remember, this is your opportunity to assess whether the company and the role are right for you as well.

## After the final interview

One thing that candidates often forget about is following up after the interview. An elegant and nice thing to do is to send a "thank you" email to your recruiter and interviewers  right after the interview and thank them for the opportunity to speak to the company. You can use this as an opportunity to keep the conversation open in case they have more questions, and it also gives the prospective employer a chance to come back to you with updates on next steps. If you aren't selected for the role this time, they might come back to you in the future if new positions open up; everybody remembers a highly qualified candidate. Also if you don't receive an offer for the role, ask for feedback to improve your interview skills for future success.
