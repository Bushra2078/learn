One of your interviews will be about writing code. To prepare for this type of interview, you can practice on writing the code and improving the process. In this exercise, you will perform tasks that addresses that set you up for solving code and give you a process for improving.

## Bookmark useful practice sites

Here's a set of training sites you can use to practice your coding skills:

- [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com) 
- [Coderbyte](https://www.coderbyte.com)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
- [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

1. Visit several of the code practice sites listed in the previous section. Bookmark sites that you find useful.

   ```output
   Pick [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com) for example, and bookmark it**.
   ```

## Establish a practice pattern

To ensure your practice has the most effect, you need to establish some good patterns for how to practice.

1. Set a reminder each day for a given number of days before your scheduled interview to complete one or more code challenges:

   ```output
   For example, set a reminder to work on code problems between 5pm-7pm.
   ```

   Another thing you can do is to take notes on the problems you took and how you were able to solve, or not solve, those problems.

2. Make a note of any challenges that you found difficult, and revisit those in future practice sessions.

   ```text
   Here's an example note: Problem on Roman numerals, need to work on understanding recursion better.
   ```

## Make the most of your practice

Part of practicing is about learning to solve the problem in the first place, but also to become better at solving it. There are steps you can take to ensure you improve.

1. Challenge yourself to be able to finish a task within a given set of minutes, and then go back and explain your thought processes.

   ```output
   What did you do differently?
   ```

1. Set yourself a goal to practice at least one task per day and make notes of your learning curve as you improve.

   ```output
   Write down what you learned to do, it improves memory and recall.
   ```

1. Select more difficult problems to solve as you become better at solving certain type of problems and as you notice improvements.

   ```output
   Look back at your progress a week later and notice how you improved.
   ```
