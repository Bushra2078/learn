  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What's the best way to prepare for an interview at an algorithmic
        focused company?
      choices:
        - content: Read a book on design patterns
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. While design patterns are an important part of coding,
            it's better to use a platform like TopCoder to practice known
            algorithmic problems.
        - content: Do a so-called "code kata"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Code katas are definitely a good way to practice common
            problems. Some of the katas are even algorithmic in nature. A better
            option is a platform like TopCoder or Project Euler.
        - content: Practice problems on a platform like TopCoder
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A platform like TopCoder enables you to practice specific
            algorithmic problems and usually analyzes your solution's quality.
