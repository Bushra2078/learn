While it was great reading about these technologies, a much more exciting way to learn about them is to install them and begin playing around. This unit will teach you how to install Visual Studio Code.

## Install Visual Studio Code

As mentioned before, Visual Studio Code is free. You can download it [on the Visual Studio Code downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download?azure-portal=true). Click on the download box according to which operating system you're running - macOS, Windows, or Linux. When the program has finished downloading, click on the executable file in the grey box at the bottom left of the browser window to initiate the installation process.

> [!NOTE]
> The picture below shows someone using Windows 10 with the Microsoft Edge browser, but you should choose the box that represents your system.

After you click on the box, you'll be asked to accept the license agreement and fill out preferences for the application. You'll also be asked where to install the program. Read over the license agreement and then click **agree**.

Finally, click **install** on the last window to finish the installation.

## Configure Visual Studio Code

After Visual Studio Code is installed, you may have the option to have it open on its own. If you can't see the start dialogue, just find the application on your computer and start it. When you first come into Visual Studio Code, you'll be greeted with a welcome window. Let's start by closing this window. You'll see on the left side of the screen that there are various icons that, when you click on them, open other features of Visual Studio Code. Below is a brief overview of a few of the sections we'll be using.

- Explorer: Shows which file(s) you have open and the contents of the folder, if you're in one
- Search: Allows you to look for a certain word or collection of words in your file
- Source control: Helps you write/share code with others
- Run: Runs the code you write
- Extensions: Shows all the additions people from across the globe have made. There are different color themes, programming languages, and more. You can install and customize Visual Studio Code as you like
- Azure: An optional extension that helps integrate Microsoft Azure into Visual Studio Code
- Docker: Beyond the scope of this lesson
