Now that you've installed everything you need, you can create a Jupyter Notebook file and start coding.

## Create a Jupyter Notebook file

To start, you should make a folder to easily organize all of the Jupyter files you'll create. Pick a location on your computer that's easily accessible, such as the documents folder or desktop, and create a folder named something like `Jupyter files` or `Python`.

Go to Visual Studio Code and locate the "file" tab at the top left of the screen, to create a Jupyter Notebook file that will run your Python code. Click on the "file" tab to view a drop-down menu and click on **new file**. You'll then be taken to a blank file. Save the file as a Jupyter file: click **file** and then **save** or enter keystrokes `ctrl-s`.

Give your file a name of your choosing, select the save location to be the folder you just created, and then change the file type to "Jupyter" from the drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can add the file extension `.ipynb`, which will automatically change the file type to "Jupyter".

You'll know that it worked if you see the filename followed by ".ipynb" in the top left of the screen and your file displays cells instead of the solid editor view when you open it in Visual Studio Code.

## Configure Python environment

When you have a Jupyter Notebook file,you'll need to choose which Python environment you're using. Visual Studio Code might have recognized Python after you installed it, but if it doesn't, click the box on the bottom left of the screen and select the version you installed.

Next, you'll need to add Jupyter Notebooks to your path. Type "2+2" into the first line of the editor and click the green play button. At the bottom right of the screen you'll see a pop-up asking you to install Jupyter Notebooks, click "install" to start the installation. This can take up to 5 minutes, so you may have to wait a while.

Now, Jupyter Notebooks should be installed on your computer. Before you continue, make sure that the Jupyter Notebook Kernel is also running with the right version of Python. You can see the version in the top right of Visual Studio Code where it says "Jupyter Server: local" followed by the instance of Python.

## Information about Jupyter Notebooks

[Visual Studio Code Jupyter Notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support?azure-portal=true) has good documentation about how to use the environment. In Jupyter notebooks, you write code in cells. Click on the plus button to the left of a cell to create a new cell below the current cell. Click on the garbage can to the right to delete the selected cell and use the arrow buttons to move the cell up or down in relation to the cells around it.

Use the green play button in each cell to run that cell. After you run a cell, a number will appear, surrounded by square brackets. This number is to help you keep track of which cells you run. This is important because, as you'll remember, you can re-run cells within a Jupyter Notebook, which might change variables or program state.

If you look at the top of the file, you will see that you can run all cells above or below the current cell by using the play button. Finally, you can click the red pause button to force stop the program at any time.

## Write and run a simple program

Now you'll test your setup by writing a simple "Hello World" program. In the first line of the editor, type the following code and then click the green play button.

```python
"Hello World"
```

Below the cell that you ran, there should be an output saying Hello World.

Congratulations! You have programmed a computer to output text. Next step: ~~hacking the mainframe~~ ... or maybe we'll start by learning more about Python fundamentals!
