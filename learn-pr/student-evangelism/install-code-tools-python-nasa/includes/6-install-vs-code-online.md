> [!NOTE]
> This is an optional section that you should follow only if you want to use Visual Studio Code in the browser through GitHub Codespaces instead of downloaded onto your computer. The rest of the module depicts the instructions using a downloaded version of Visual Studio Code.

Joining the [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces?azure-portal=true) gives you the opportunity run Visual Studio Code in your browser. By using a browser, you can begin your Python coding journey without having to download any software.

## Benefits of GitHub Codespaces

You can find [a quick startup guide to Codespaces here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces?azure-portal=true).

> [!WARNING]
> GitHub Codespaces does have a minimal fee paid for through your Azure subscription. To understand more [about billing for Codespaces.](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/codespaces-reference/understanding-billing-for-codespaces?azure-portal=true) and cost for using a basic instance refer to [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-codespaces?azure-portal=true).

The benefits of GitHub Codespaces include:

- Your development environment is linked to your GitHub account rather than a physical device.
- You have tighter integration with GitHub for your projects.
- Visual Studio Code extensions are available for customization.
- Projects with different development environments won't clash on your physical device.
