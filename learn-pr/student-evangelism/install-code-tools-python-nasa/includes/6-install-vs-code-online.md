> [!NOTE]
> This is an optional section that you should follow only if you want to use Visual Studio Code in the browser and not downloaded onto your computer. The rest of the module will depict the instructions using a downloaded version of Visual Studio Code.

Microsoft Azure gives you the opportunity to run Visual Studio Code in your browser using [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/). By using a browser you can begin your Python coding journey without having to download any software.

## Create a Microsoft Azure account

To start using this code editor in your browser, you must first create a free Microsoft Azure account. Start by going to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Either sign in with a Microsoft account or create a free account. 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure has free accounts for both [professionals/individuals](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and [students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/).

## Instructions to set up Codespaces

To run Python using Jupyter Notebooks from within Visual Studio Code, you'll use Visual Studio Codespaces. As with most Visual Studio Code features, you can find [a quick startup guide to Codespaces here](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/online/quickstarts/browser).

> [!WARNING]
> [Visual Studio Codespaces does have a minimal fee](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/visual-studio-online/) paid for through your Azure subscription. The cost for a basic instance at the time of publishing this module is $0.085 per hour. For a comprehensive list of the costs, you can check out the [Visual Studio Codespaces pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?service=visual-studio-online). With the use of either a [professionals/individuals](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or [students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/) free account, you shouldn't have to pay for anything to complete this learning path.

## Configuring Visual Studio Codespaces

Once you're connected to Visual Studio Codespaces, you'll be greeted with a welcome window. Let's start by closing this window. You'll see on the left side of the screen that there are various icons you can click on. Below is a brief overview of a few of the sections that we'll be using.

- Explorer: Shows which file(s) you have open and the contents of the folder, if you're in one
- Search: Allows you to look for a certain word or collection of words in your file
- Source control: Helps you store/share code with others
- Run: Runs the code you write
- Extensions: Shows all the additions people from across the globe have made. There are different color themes, programming languages, and more. You can install and customize Visual Studio Code as you like
- Remote Explorer: Beyond the scope of this lesson
- GitHub: A type of source control. Links Visual Studio Code with GitHub
- Live share: Have others view your screen while you work
