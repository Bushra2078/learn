Welcome to the first of many modules showing you real-life examples of how NASA might use Microsoft technologies to assist them in their space-related endeavors. A big part of why NASA is so successful is the powerful software they create. If you want to be part of NASA and the exploration of space, knowing how to code would be an invaluable skill. Lucky for you, this learning path will take anyone with an interest in code and help them develop a foundation of skills. Throughout the various [NASA-themed learning paths you'll find on Microsoft Learn](Missing: NASA landing page on Learn), you'll see NASA-themed coding examples that include using Python and machine learning to discover more about rocks from the Moon and predict the best days for launching a rocket into space.

In this module, you'll be introduced to Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks. You'll learn how to install all of the software and packages you'll need to begin writing code to explore NASA data.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn about and test software that assists developers, particularly in data exploration. Along the way you'll learn:

- What a programming language is
- How to install Visual Studio Code and about the benefits of this code editor
- How to install extensions to enhance the Visual Studio Code experience
- How to install Python and why it is such a popular programming language
- How to run a basic Jupyter Notebook within Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
