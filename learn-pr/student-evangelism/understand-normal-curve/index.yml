title: Understand the normal curve
summary: Learn about the normal curve
abstract: |
  The UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational 
  thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that 
  data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming 
  and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, 
  document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data 
  analysis such as privacy and design.

  In this module, you will:
  - Understand various properties of the mean and its importance as a statistic.
  - Measure the spread of values in a distribution and converted distributions to Standard Units.
  - Learn the properties of the normal distribution and different bounds.
  - Examine the Central Limit Theorem through simulations and studied some use cases.
