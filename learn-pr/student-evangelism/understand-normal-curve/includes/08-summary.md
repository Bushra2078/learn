Congratulations on finishing this module! Just a brief recap of what we did in this module: we took a deep dive into mean as a statistic, learned about the concept of variability in distribution & some Laws of Statistics, and studied the normal curve. 

And here are some of the learning objectives we achieved in this module.

- Understand various properties of the mean and its importance as a statistic.
- Measure the spread of values in a distribution and converted distributions to Standard Units.
- Learn the properties of the normal distribution and different bounds.
- Examine the Central Limit Theorem through simulations and studied some use cases.
