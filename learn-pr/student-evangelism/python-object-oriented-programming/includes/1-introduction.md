Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows you to model the real-world in code. There are several benefits to using this paradigm, OOP allows you to create implementation that are easy to modify and extend with less code.

As part of a development team, you will write code that solves small as well as large and more intricate problems. OOP is one programming paradigm out of many, but it does have some interesting constructs and principles that will help frame your thinking.

You decide to evaluate OOP by applying it on a small and defined problem, a game of rock paper scissors to see if it's a fit for you and your team.
