Attributes hold the data that defines an object. For a pink flower, *pink* is an attribute of the flower. If you wrote a `flower` class, you might include an attribute named `color` that describes the flower's color. You might also include an attribute that indicates the flower's typeâ€”for example, iris, tulip, or rose. Objects are not required to have attributes but most do.

In this unit, you write a class named `Person` to hold information about a person. You add attributes to the class and learn how to access those attributes. You also learn about an important convention that enables selected members of a class to be marked "for internal use only" so other programmers will steer clear of them.

## Class attributes vs. instance attributes

Attributes come in two varieties: class attributes and instance attributes. A class attribute is an attribute that applies to *all* instances of a class rather than to individual instances (objects created from the class). What's interesting about class attributes is that you don't have to instantiate a class to access them. Class attributes are always available.

A great example of a class attribute is in Python's built-in `math` class. The `math` class has class attributes named `pi` and `e` that contain the values of common mathematical constants. Because you don't have to create a class instance to access a class attribute, you can compute the area of a circle this way in Python:

```python
area = math.pi * radius * radius
```

You could easily write a class of your own that exposes these same values as class attributes:

```python
class constants:
    pi = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288
    e =  2.71828182845904523536028747135266249
```

Using the constants would then be a matter of referencing class attributes on your own class:

```python
area = constants.pi * radius * radius
```

By contrast, an instance attribute is one that is "instanced" for each and every object you create. A `person` class might have a `name` attribute that holds a person's name. `name` would need to be an instance attribute so that every `person` could be assigned a different name. That class also could have attributes that define additional information about a missing person, such as:

- A photo of the person's face
- A unique ID, such as a social security number
- The person's date of birth

These attributes should be instance attributes because they vary from person to person.
