Imagine you work for a company that locates missing persons. You have been assigned to a team that is writing an application to catalog missing persons and information about them in a database. Your code will define the information stored about each person, including a name and a photo, and provide logic for acting upon that information. The application is written in Python, so you will be using Python as well.

You could write classic procedural code containing functions such as `add_missing_person_to_database()` and `get_information_about_missing_person()`. But such code, while common, can also be difficult to maintain â€” especially as, over time, the code base grows in size and complexity.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a proven way of structuring your code so that it is easier to write, understand, test, and maintain. Rather than leave it to other programmers to figure out how to take the photos you store and display them on the screen, for example, you could define an object that represents a missing person and build the capability to display that person's photo into the object. Subsequently, anyone could render a photo of a missing person on the screen with a simple function call.

Writing object-oriented code in Python is a little different than writing procedural code, but if you know the basics of Python, it isn't difficult. In this module, you learn how to write object-oriented code in Python and also see first-hand some of the benefits of doing so.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Write classes in Python
- Add attributes to a class
- Add methods to a class
- Learn how to inherit classes
- Add methods and attributes to an inherited classes
- Override methods inherited from a base class

## Prerequisites
A basic knowledge of programming and Python.
