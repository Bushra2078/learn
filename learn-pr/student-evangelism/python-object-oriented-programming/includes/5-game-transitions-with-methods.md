The end goal of a system is to produce useful output. To get there, you need to process the input. While *processing*, you might need the help of various methods and data. In object-oriented programming (OOP), your methods and your data are placed on objects. To process the input and produce a result in OOP, you need methods. 

## Methods in OOP

No matter the paradigm used, methods can carry out an action. That action can be a computation that only relies on inputs, or it can change the value of a variable.

Methods on objects in OOP come in two flavors:

- **External methods**, which other objects can invoke.
- **Internal methods**, which aren't reachable by other objects. Additionally, internal methods help carry out a task started by an invocation to an external method.

No matter what type of method, they can change the value of an object's attribute; in other words, its *state*.

The notion of state, and *who* and *what* can change it, is an important subject. It's an important part of designing your classes and object. These questions lead us into our next section, *encapsulation*.

## Encapsulation: Protect your data

The general idea of encapsulation is that the data on an object is *internal*, something that only concerns the object. Data is needed for the object and the methods to do their job, which is to carry out a task. When you say the data is *internal*, you're saying it should be protected from other outside manipulation, or rather *uncontrolled* outside manipulation. The question is: why?

### Why you need it

Let's explain the reasoning why data shouldn't be directly touched by another object. Here are some examples:

- **You don't need to know the internals.** When you drive a car, you press a pedal to control the clutch or to accelerate or brake. Because you're operating your car at a higher level, you don't care about what goes on underneath; how the car carries out the action. It's the same thing with code. Most of the time, you don't need to know how an object does something, as long as there's a method you can invoke that does what you want.
- **You shouldn't know the internals.** Instead of having a pedal to interact with the car, imagine you had a screwdriver or a soldering kit to try to accelerate. Sounds scary, right? That's because it is. Or, let's say you have a more concrete example, a square class, with the following code:

   ```python
   class Square:
       def __init__(self):
           self.height = 2
           self.width = 2
       def set_side(self, new_side):
           self.height = new_side
           self.width = new_side

   square = Square()
   square.height = 3 # not a square anymore
   ```

   In the square example, you break the notion of what a square is by setting the `height` variable. The way the square is coded, it needs you to invoke the method `set_side()` for the square to function properly. Letting the object take care of its data is considered safer. In nearly every instance, you should choose to interact via a method versus setting the data explicitly.

### Access levels

How can you protect your class and your object from unwanted manipulation of data? The answer is with *access levels*. You can hide data from the outside world, and from other objects, by marking data and functions with specific keywords. These keywords are known as access modifiers.

The way Python accomplishes data hiding is by adding prefixes to attribute names. One leading underscore, `_`, is a message to the outside world that this data probably shouldn't be touched. When you modify the square class, you end up with this code:

```python
  class Square:
      def __init__(self):
          self._height = 2
          self._width = 2
      def set_side(self, new_side):
          self._height = new_side
          self._width = new_side

  square = Square()
  square._height = 3 # not a square anymore
```

One leading underscore still allows for data to be modified, which Python refers to as *protected*. Can we do this better? Yes we can, by having two leading underscores, `__`, which is referred to as *private*. Your square class should now look like this code:

```python
  class Square:
      def __init__(self):
          self.__height = 2
          self.__width = 2
    def set_side(self, new_side):
          self.__height = new_side
          self.__width = new_side

  square = Square()
  square.__height = 3 # raises AttributeError
```

Great, so we're safe. Have we protected our data? Well, not entirely. Python just changes the name of the underlying data. By entering this code, you can still change its value:

```python
square = Square()
square._Square__height = 3 # is allowed
```

Many other languages that implement data protection solve this issue differently. Python is unique in that data protection is more like levels of suggestion rather than being strictly implemented.

### What are getters and setters?

We've said so far that data in general shouldn't be touched from the outside. Data is the object's concern. As with all rules and strong recommendations, there are exceptions. Sometimes you need to change the data, or changing it is simpler than having to add a significant amount of code.

Getters and setters, which are also known as *accessors* and *mutators*, are methods dedicated to reading or changing your data. Getters play the part of making your inner data readable to the outside, which doesn't sound so bad, does it? Setters are methods that can change your data directly. The idea is for a setter to act as a guard so that a *bad* value can't be set. Let's bring up our square class again and see getters and setters in action:

```python
  class Square:
      def __init__(self):
          self.__height = 2
          self.__width = 2
      def set_side(self, new_side):
          self.__height = new_side
          self.__width = new_side
      def get_height(self):
          return self.__height
      def set_height(self, h):
          if h >= 0:
              self.__height = h
          else:
              raise Exception("value needs to be 0 or larger")

  square = Square()
  square.__height = 3 # raises AttributeError
```

The method `set_height()` protects you from setting the value to something negative. If you do, it raises an exception.

### Use decorators for getters and setters

Decorators are an important subject in Python. They're part of a larger subject called *meta programming*. Decorators are functions that take your function as an input. The idea is to encode reusable functionality as *decorator functions* and then *decorate* other functions with it. The purpose is to give your function a feature it didn't have before. A decorator can, for example, add fields to your object, measure the time it takes to invocate a function, and do much more.

In the context of OOP and getters and setters, a specific decorator `@property` can help you remove some boilerplate code when you add getters and setters. The `@property` decorator does the following things for you:

- **Creates a backing field**: When you decorate a function with the `@property` decorator, it creates a backing private field. You can override this behavior if you want, but it's nice to have a default behavior.
- **Identifies a setter**: A setter method can change the backing field.
- **Identifies a getter**: This function should return the backing field.
- **Identifies a delete function**: This function can delete the field.

Let's see this decorator in action:

```python
class Square:
    def __init__(self, w, h):
        self.height = h
        self.__width = w
  
    def set_side(self, new_side):
        self.__height = new_side
        self.__width = new_side

    @property
    def height(self):
        return self.__height

    @height.setter
    def height(self, new_value):
        if new_value >= 0:
            self.__height = new_value
        else:
            raise Exception("Value must be larger than 0")
```

In the preceding code, the function `height()` is decorated by the decorator `@property`. This *decoration* action creates the private field `__height`. The `__height` field isn't defined in the constructor `__init__()` because the decorator does that already. There's also another decoration happening, namely, `@height.setter`. This decoration points out a similar-looking `height()` method as the *setter*. The new height method takes on another parameter `value` as its second parameter.

Being able to manipulate the height separate from the width will still cause a problem. You'll need to understand what the class does before you consider allowing getters and setters, because you're introducing risk.
