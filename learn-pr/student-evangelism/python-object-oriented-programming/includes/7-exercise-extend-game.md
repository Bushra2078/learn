Your company is pleased with your object-oriented programming (OOP) implementation of rock, paper, scissors. So much so that they want you to change the game to rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock, because that's what all the cool kids are playing these days.

## Add the choices lizard and Spock

Adding two more choices like lizard and Spock might sound like there's a lot to change. Thanks to the way you implemented the rules, the changes you need are minor.

What are the rules for lizard and Spock though?

*Scissors decapitate lizard, scissors cut paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitate lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.*

The preceding description can be translated into this updated rules table:

|Choice   |Rock     |Paper    |Scissors |Lizard |Spock |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|------|
|Rock     |  0      | -1      |  1      |  1    | -1   |
|Paper    |  1      |  0      | -1      | -1    |  1   |
|Scissors | -1      |  1      |  0      |  1    | -1   |
|Lizard   | -1      |  1      | -1      |  0    |  1   |  
|Spock    |  1      | -1      |  1      | -1    |  0   |

1. Locate the `Participant` class, and update the method `toNumericalChoice()` to look like so:

   ```python
       def toNumericalChoice(self):
           switcher = {
                "rock": 0,
                "paper": 1,
                "scissor": 2,
                "lizard": 3,
                "spock": 4
           }
           return switcher[self.choice]
   ```

1. Locate the `GameRound` class. In the `__init__()` method, change the `self.rules` variable to this code:

   ```python
           self.rules = [
               [0, -1, 1, 1, -1],
               [1, 0, -1, -1, 1],
               [-1, 1, 0, 1, -1],
               [-1, 1, -1, 0, 1],
               [1, -1, 1, -1, 0]
           ]
   ```

1. Locate the `Participant` class. Update the method `choose` to include the new options: 

   ```python
       def choose(self):
           self.choice = input("{name}, select rock, paper, scissor, lizard or Spock: ".format(name= self.name))
           print("{name} selects {choice}".format(name=self.name, choice = self.choice))
   ```


1. Save the file, then run `python3 rock-paper-scissor.py` to try out your changes:

   ```bash
   python3 rock-paper-scissor.py
   ```

   Select `spock` and `paper` to see that the rules work properly. Your output should look similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Spock, select rock, paper, scissor, lizard or spock: spock
   Spock selects spock
   Kirk, select rock, paper, scissor, lizard or spock: paper
   Kirk selects paper
   Round resulted in a loss
   Continue game y/n: n
   Game ended, Spock has 0, and Kirk has 1
   Winner is Kirk
   ```

Congratulations! You've added two choices, *lizard* and *Spock*, to the game with minimal effort to your code.
