    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Alan Kay originally described objects as containers for which of the following?"
      choices:
      - content: "Methods and classes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Objects are containers for methods, but a class defines what's in an object, so an object isn't a container for a class."
      - content: "Events and objects"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Objects are containers for events and objects can contain other objects, but they are contained as an attribute."
      - content: "Methods, attributes, and events"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! These are the 3 primary things an object contains."
    - content: "Which of the following statements about Python is correct?"
      choices:
      - content: "In Python, a character is an instance of the built-in `char` class"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Python actually treats characters as a string of length 1."
      - content: "In Python, a string is an instance of the built-in `str` class"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
      - content: "Python supports subclassing but limits each class to one subclass"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Python does not limit classes to only have one subclass."
    - content: "Python's `math.exp()` method is an example of what type of method?"
      choices:
      - content: "Instance method"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. We did not have to create an object of the `math` class to use the `exp()` method"
      - content: "Class method"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. We didn't cover this in depth, but we aren't creating object factories, so class method isn't a strong guess."
      - content: "Static method"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! We are using the static `exp()` method without haven't to instantiate the class."
    - content: "Which of the following methods might be useful when overriding a method inherited from a base class?"
      choices:
      - content: "`base()`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't a method used in inheritance."
      - content: "`inheritedFrom()`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't a method used in inheritance."
      - content: "`delattr()`"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! We would use this to remove an inherited attribute."
    - content: "Which of the following statements is false?"
      choices:
      - content: "Python supports data hiding using conventions, not strict rules"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Python doesn't strictly support hiding data."
      - content: "Python provides native support for methods, attributes, and events"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Python provides native support for methods and attributes, but not for events."
      - content: "You can't delete methods inherited by a subclass"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This is true. You can delete attributes, but not methods."
