  questions:
    - content: 'How many times (iterations) does the body of the for loop run?'
      choices:
        - content: '7'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: '4'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: There are only 4 elements in the array (1, 2, 3, 7), so the body of the for loop will run 4 times.
        - content: '0'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'At Iteration 1, what is count equal to?'
      choices:
        - content: '1'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct, at the first iteration, "count" is assigned to the first item of the array, which is 1'
        - content: '0'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: '2'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'How many times will "Even!" be printed during the execution of the for loop?'
      choices:
        - content: '0'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: '1'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'In iteration 2, count is assigned to 2, and 2%2 is 0, so "Even!" will be printed in that iteration. All of the other iterations should print "Odd!"'
        - content: '2'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
