  title: Check your Knowledge
  questions:
    - content: 'A table with just the names and emails of all students.'
      choices:
        - content: students.select('name', 'age')
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. We want the names and the emails from the table.
        - content: students.select('name').select('email')
          explanation: Incorrect. students.select('name') returns a table with just one-column 'name', so you cannot select 'email' from this resulting one-column table.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: students.select(name, email)
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Column names should be in quotation marks to signify they should be searched for in the table.
        - content: students.select('name', 'email') correct
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.
    - content: 'A table ordered by age from oldest to youngest.'
      choices:
        - content: students.sort('age')
          explanation: Incorrect. The default sort here will sort the table from youngest to oldest.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: students.sort('age', descending=False)
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The sort with "descending=False" will sort the table in acsending order, which will sort the table from youngest to oldest.
        - content: students.sort('age', descending=True)
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The sort with "descending=True" will sort the table in descending order, which will sort the table from oldest to youngest.
        - content: students.sort('age', ascending=False)
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. There is no parameter called "ascending" for the sort function.
    - content: 'A table with just the names of the students, ordered from the youngest to oldest.'
      choices:
        - content: students.select('name').sort('age')
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. students.select returns a one-column table that does not include age, so the sort function would error.
        - content: students.sort('age').select('name')
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The table should be sorted first, then single out the column "name" from the sorted table.
        - content: students.select('name', 'age').sort('age')
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. While "select" do support selecting multiple columns at once, the column names should be in an array. The correct version of this code will also return a two-column table.
        - content: students.sort('age').select('name', 'age')
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. We want a table with only one-column, the above code returns a two-column table.
