  title: Check your Knowledge
  questions:
    - content: 'Which line of code returns a new table which displays the total number of candies and the total cost for each unique color?'
      choices:
        - content: "marbles.group('Color', max)"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: "marbles.group('Color')"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: "marbles.group('Color', sum)"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: We want one row in the new table for each unique candy color, which points to grouping by color, and the aggregation function in group should return the total for each group, which will be done by the function sum.
        - content: "marbles.group('Price', sum)"
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: 'What will be the new column names of the table generated above?'
      choices:
        - content: '"Color", "Amount", "Price($)"'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect, these are the original column names'
        - content: '"Color", "Amount sum", "Price($) sum"'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct, the group fuction attaches the aggregation function name to the end of the original column names to all columns besides the column being grouped on'
        - content: '"color", "amount sum", "price($) sum"'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'The group function will not change the capitalization of the original column names'
    - content: "If we had another two-column table called 'flavors' with a column called 'Color' for the candy's color(Red, Green, or Blue) and another column called 'Flavor' for each color's unique corresponding flavor, how can we combine the two tables so that we get every combination possible for a bag of candy?"
      choices:
        - content: 'candy.join("Color", flavors)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct, the syntax for tbl.join is tblA.join(colA, tblB, colB). Since colA and colB in this case have the same name, tblA.join(colA, tblB) will also return the correct result.'
        - content: 'candy.join(flavors)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect, missing the column to join the two tables on.'
        - content: 'candy.join(Color, flavors)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect, the column to join the two tables on should be in quotes.'
    - content: 'using the original table called "candy", which of the following code will return a table that clearly shows the price for every combination of color and amount for a bag of candy, with one row for each color?'
      choices:
        - content: 'candy.pivot("Amount", "Color")'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect, pivot with just those two arguments will return table that counts how many bags of candy are of that particular color and amount combination, not the price of the bag.'
        - content: 'candy.pivot("Amount", "Color", "Price($)")'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect, when you are using the third argument, an aggregation function must be used. This code will result in an error.'
        - content: 'candy.pivot("Amount", "Color", "Price($)", sum)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct. Since the amount of candy in each bag is unique, there will only be one bag of candy for each color and amount combination. Then using sum as the aggregation function will return just the price of that particular bag of candy. The first argument will get a column for each unique value, and the secomd will get a row for each unique value, which is what the question is asking for.'
