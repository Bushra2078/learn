Beyond the innovations that are happening for this program to support future missions, there is research still happening that will benefit from the mission. 

One example is the study of rocks. It has been almost 50 years since a person was last on the surface of the Moon, which means any rock samples are almost 50 years old. We know that rocks tell rich and vibrant histories of the land that they come from. Even on Earth, the study of rocks gives us insight into prehistoric times and the evolution of our present-day Earth. 

Rocks collected from the Moon are stored in the [lunar sample building at the Johnson Space Center](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/) where they are available for study by NASA Scientists. The problem is that there is only a finite number of samples and many research questions to ask. There are teams of people who analyze and categorize Moon rocks and determine the risk involved in using parts of samples to conduct research. These teams will sometimes have to deny the request to use a sample because NASA tries to maintain the general health of their entire sample to ensure they have as clear picture as possible of what has been discovered in physical form. 

With a new mission to the Moon, we have the opportunity to gather more of the same types of rocks that we've gathered in the past to increase the size of the samples, and discover new rocks that might be of interest in learning what has happened on the surface of the Moon over the past 50 years. This presents an opportunity for astronauts and geologists to work together to decide the types and quantities of rocks required and what metadata to collect. 

Furthermore, the addition of machines to the exploration of the Moon's surface has enabled computer scientists to become involved in the conversation, to try to ensure that the rovers are able to contribute to the data collection as well. Deciding how to program a robot to collect samples, collect metadata, and not disturb the sample area is non-trivial, especially considering that developers can't test the robots in a truly accurate environment before sending them on the mission.
