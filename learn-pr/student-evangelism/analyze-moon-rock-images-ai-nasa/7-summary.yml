    choices:
    - content: "To train the model with one portion of the data and test the model with the rest of the data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! We separate data into training and testing groups so we can split the data between the two groups."
    - content: "Data is separated into training and testing groups because the computer can't test that much data."

    - content: "To train the model more quickly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The speed with a computer can train the model isn't the reason we separate data into a training and testing groups."
  - content: "How do computers view images?"
