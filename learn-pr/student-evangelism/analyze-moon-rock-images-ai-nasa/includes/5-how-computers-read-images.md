Now that we have our data cleaned and separated, you might wonder how the computer reads these images. As somewhat of a spoiler, computer can't read images the same way you or I see images.

If you know something about computers, you know that computers read things in binary: 1s and 0s. So, how can a computer read a complex image as only 1s and 0s? If you break down an image far enough, it too, is just a combination of 1s and 0s.

An image will look like the following example after a computer transforms them into numbers:

:::image type="content" alt-text="ADD ALT TEXT HERE." source="../media/lincoln.png" loc-scope="Azure":::

:::image type="content" alt-text="ADD ALT TEXT HERE." source="../media/pixels.png" loc-scope="Azure":::

The image is broken down into pixels, and each pixel has a specific color that is identified by a code. After a computer breaks down an image into these codes, it can read and decipher the image.
