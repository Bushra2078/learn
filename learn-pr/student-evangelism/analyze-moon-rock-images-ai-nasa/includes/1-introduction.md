Now that you have some background information on what artificial intelligence (AI) is and how it can be used, you can start creating your own program that uses AI. The libraries that you installed will be a great starting step into creating the rock classification program because they will give you a base model that you can train to complete the task at hand.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Visual Studio Code, Python and Jupyter Notebooks to read in and clean up images of rocks that we'll use to create and train an AI model.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Import artificial libraries
- Learn how to import data
- Learn how to clean and separate data
- Show the data you imported

## Prerequisites

- Ability to write and run introductory Python programs
- Visual Studio Code, Python Extension, and Jupyter Notebooks installed
- Artificial intelligence libraries installed
