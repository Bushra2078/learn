Now that you have some background information on what artificial intelligence (AI) is and how it can be used, you can start creating your own program that uses AI. The libraries that you installed will be a great first step in creating a rock classification program. The libraries give you a base model that you can train to complete the task at hand.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks to add and clean up images of rocks that we'll use to create and train an AI model.

## Learning objectives
