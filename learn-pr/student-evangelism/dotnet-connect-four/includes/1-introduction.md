## Scenario

This module walks you through Blazor and introduces the following concepts:

- Blazor component fundamentals
- How to get started with the Blazor WebAssembly project template
- How to construct and use a layout for a Blazor component
- How to react to user interactions

We accomplish the above goals by writing a classic four-in-a-row "Connect Four" game that runs in your browser using WebAssembly. In this game, two players alternate taking turns placing a game piece (typically a checker) in the top of the board. Game pieces fall to the lowest row of a column and the player that places four game pieces to make a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
