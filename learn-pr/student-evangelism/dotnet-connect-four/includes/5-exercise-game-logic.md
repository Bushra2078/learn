In this exercise, we add game logic to our app to ensure we end up with a fully functioning game.

To help keep this tutorial on-topic with teaching about Blazor, we're providing a class called `GameState`.cs that contains the logic for managing the game.

## Adding Game state

The *GameState.cs file* is in this [repository](https://github.com/dotnet/intro-to-dotnet-web-dev/blob/main/5-blazor/1-complete/ConnectFour/Shared/GameState.cs) and you copy it into your version of the game.

1. Copy the *GameState.cs* file from this repository into your project in the *Shared* folder.

   We need to make an instance of the `GameState` available to any component that requests it, and only one instance of `GameState` should be available in our application at a time. We address this need by registering our GameState as a Singleton in the application.
 
1. Open the *Program.cs* file at the root of the project and let's add this statement after the `builder.AddServices...` statement:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddSingleton<ConnectFour.Shared.GameState>();
    ```

    We can now inject an instance of our `GameState` class into our Board component to work with.

1. Add the following directive at the top of the *Board.razor* file,  to inject the current state of the game into the component:

    ```csharp
    @inject ConnectFour.Shared.GameState State
    ```

    We can now start connecting our Board component to the state of the game.

### Reset state

Let's begin by resetting the state of the game when the Board component is first painted on screen.

Let's add some code to reset the state of the game when the component is initialized.

1. Add the method `OnInitialized()` with a call to `ResetBoard()`, inside the `@code` block at the bottom of the Board.razor file like so:

    ```csharp
    @code {
    	protected override void OnInitialized()
    	{
    		State.ResetBoard();
    	}
    }
    ```

    When the board is first shown to a user, the state is reset to the beginning of a game.

## Create game pieces

Next, let's allocate the possible 42 game pieces that could be played. We can represent the game pieces as an array referenced by 42 HTML elements on the board. We can move and place those pieces by assigning a set of CSS classes with column and row positions.

1. Define an array to hold our game pieces:

    ```csharp
     @code {
      private string[] Pieces = new string[42];
    }
    ```

1. Add code to the HTML section that creates 42 `span` tags, one for each game piece, in the same component:

    ```html
    @for (var i = 0; i < 42; i++)
    {
       <span class="@Pieces[i]"></span>
    }
    ```
 
    Your full code should look like so:

    ```html
    @for (var i = 0; i < 42; i++)
    {
       <span class="@Pieces[i]"></span>
    }
     
    </div>
    @code {
      private string[] Pieces = new string[42];
      
    }
    ```

    By default, initialization of a string array, assigns an empty string to the CSS class of each game piece span. An empty string for a CSS class prevents the game pieces from appearing on screen as no style is applied to them.

## Handle game piece placement

Let's add a method to handle when a player places a Piece in a column. The `GameState` class knows how to assign the correct row for the game piece, and reports back the row that it lands in. We can use this information to assign CSS classes representing the player's color, the final location of the piece, and a CSS drop animation.

We call this method `PlayPiece()` and it accepts an input parameter that specifies the column (1 indexed) the player has chosen. 

1. Add this code below the `Pieces` array we defined in the previous step.

    ```csharp
    private void PlayPiece(byte col) 
    {
    	var landingRow = State.PlayPiece(col);
    	var cssClass = $"player{State.PlayerTurn} col{col} drop{landingRow}";
    	Pieces[State.CurrentTurn - 1] = cssClass;
    }
    ```

    Here's what the code does:
    1. We tell the game state to play a piece in the submitted column called `col` and capture the row the piece landed in.
    1. We can then define the 3 CSS classes to assign to the game piece to identify which player is currently acting, the column the piece was placed in, and the landing row.
    1. The last line of the method chooses the next element in the `Pieces` array and assigns these classes to that game piece.

    If you look in the supplied *Board.razor.css*, you find the CSS classes matching column, row and player turn.

    The resultant effect is that the game piece is placed in the column and animated to drop into the bottom-most row when this method is called.

### Choosing a column

We next need to place some controls that allow players to choose a column and call our new `PlayPiece()` method.

1. Add a row of HTML elements above the board that calls this method when they're clicked.

    > [!TIP]
    > We could use characters to indicate "Play Here"... or we could be a little fancy and use an emote, as .NET, C#, and Blazor support using emote characters in our code. 

    Let's use this character "ðŸ”½" to indicate that you can drop a piece in this column.

    Above the starting `<div>` tag, let's add a row of buttons:

    ```html
    <nav>
    	<span title="Click to play a piece" @onclick="() => PlayPiece(0)">ðŸ”½</span>
    	<span title="Click to play a piece" @onclick="() => PlayPiece(1)">ðŸ”½</span>
    	<span title="Click to play a piece" @onclick="() => PlayPiece(2)">ðŸ”½</span>
    	<span title="Click to play a piece" @onclick="() => PlayPiece(3)">ðŸ”½</span>
    	<span title="Click to play a piece" @onclick="() => PlayPiece(4)">ðŸ”½</span>
    	<span title="Click to play a piece" @onclick="() => PlayPiece(5)">ðŸ”½</span>
    	<span title="Click to play a piece" @onclick="() => PlayPiece(6)">ðŸ”½</span>
    </nav>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > We can't use a for loop for this, as we are defining an `onclick` handler for these span elements that has an assigned column number.

1. Let's review in the browser and it should look like this now:

    ![connect four board](https://github.com/dotnet/intro-to-dotnet-web-dev/raw/main/5-blazor/img/2-Board-Step3.png)

   Even better... when we select one of the drop buttons at the top, the following behavior can be observed:

   ![connect four animation](https://github.com/dotnet/intro-to-dotnet-web-dev/raw/main/5-blazor/img/2-board-drop.gif)

   Great progress! We can now add pieces to the board. The GameState object is smart enough to pivot back and forth between the two players. Go ahead and select more drop buttons and watch the results.

## Winning and error handling

If you play with the game that you've configured at this point, you find that it raises errors when you try to put too many pieces in the same column and it stops when one player has won the game.

Let's add some error handling and indicators to our board to make the current state clear.

Let's add a simple status area above the board, and below the drop buttons. 

1. Insert the following markup after the closing `</nav>` element:

    ```csharp
    </nav>
    
    <article>
    	@WinnerMessage  <button style="@ResetStyle" @onclick="ResetGame">Reset the game</button>
    	<br />
    	<span class="alert-danger">@ErrorMessage</span>
    	<span class="alert-info">@CurrentTurn</span>
    </article>
    ```

    This markup allows us to place indicators for:

    - Announcing a game winner
    - A button that allows us to restart the game
    - Error messages
    - The current player's turn

    Let's fill in some logic to set these values.

1. Add the following fields after the Pieces statement in code as we need to add fields in our code for these indicators:

    ```csharp
    private string[] Pieces = new string[42];
    
    private string WinnerMessage = string.Empty;
    
    private string ErrorMessage = string.Empty;
    
    private string CurrentTurn => (WinnerMessage == string.Empty) ? $"Player {State.PlayerTurn}'s Turn" : "";
    
    private string ResetStyle => (WinnerMessage == string.Empty) ? "display: none;" : "";
    ```

    - The `CurrentTurn` field is automatically calculated based on the state of the `WinnerMessage` and the `PlayerTurn` property of the `GameState`.

    - The `ResetStyle` is calculated based on contents of the `WinnerMessage`. If there's a `WinnerMessage`, we make the reset button appear on screen.

1. Let's handle the error message when a piece is played. Add a line to clear the error message and then wrap the three lines of the `PlayPiece` method with a `try...catch` block to set the `ErrorMessage` if an exception occurred:

    ```csharp
	ErrorMessage = string.Empty;

	try
	{
		var landingRow = State.PlayPiece(col);
		var cssClass = $"player{State.PlayerTurn} col{col} drop{landingRow}";
		Pieces[State.CurrentTurn - 1] = cssClass;
	}
	catch (ArgumentException ex)
	{
		ErrorMessage = ex.Message;
	}
    ```

    Our error handler indicator is simple, and uses the Bootstrap CSS framework to display an error in danger mode.

    ![](https://github.com/dotnet/intro-to-dotnet-web-dev/raw/main/5-blazor/img/3-Board-ErrorHandler.png)

1. Next, let's add the `ResetGame()` method that our button triggers to restart a game. Currently, the only way to restart a game is to refresh the page... this code allows us to stay on the same page.

    ```csharp
    void ResetGame()
    {
    	State.ResetBoard();
    	WinnerMessage = string.Empty;
    	ErrorMessage = string.Empty;
    	Pieces = new string[42];
    }
    ```

    Now our `ResetGame()` method has the following logic:

    - reset the state of the board.
    - hide our indicators.
    - reset the Pieces array to an empty array of 42 strings.

    This update should allow us to play the game again, and now we see an indicator just above the board declaring the player's turn and eventually the completion of the game.

    ![](https://github.com/dotnet/intro-to-dotnet-web-dev/raw/main/5-blazor/img/3-Board-Step1.png)

    We're still left in a situation where we can't select the reset button. Let's add some logic in the `PlayPiece()` method to detect the end of the game.

1. Let's detect if there's a winner to the game by adding a switch expression after our `try...catch` block in `PlayPiece()`.

    ```csharp
    WinnerMessage = State.CheckForWin() switch
    {
    	GameState.WinState.Player1_Wins => "Player 1 Wins!",
    	GameState.WinState.Player2_Wins => "Player 2 Wins!",
    	GameState.WinState.Tie => "It's a tie!",
    	_ => ""
    };
    ```

    The `CheckForWin()` method returns an enum that reports which player, if any has won the game or if the game is a tie. This switch expression will set the WinnerMessage field appropriately if a game over state has occurred.

    Now when we play and reach a game-ending scenario, these indicators appear:

## Summary

We've learned a lot about Blazor and built a neat little game. Here are just some of the skills we learned:

- Created a component
- Added that component to our home page
- Used dependency injection to manage the state of a game
- Made the game interactive with event handlers to place pieces and reset the game
- Wrote an error handler to report the state of the game
- Added parameters to our component

The project we built, is just a simple game, and there's so much more you could do with it. Looking for some challenges to improve it? Consider the following challenges:

- Remove the default layout and extra pages in the application to make it smaller.

- Improve the parameters to the Board component so that you can pass any valid CSS color value.
- Improve the indicators appearance with some CSS and HTML layout
- Introduce sound effects

- Add a visual indicator and prevent a drop button from being used when the column is full
Add networking capabilities so that you can play a friend in their browser
- Insert the game into a .NET MAUI with Blazor application and play it on your phone or tablet.

Happy coding and have fun!
