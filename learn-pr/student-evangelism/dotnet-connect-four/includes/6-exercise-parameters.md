The game works... but maybe you don't like our default colors. In Blazor, we can define parameters on our components that allow us to pass in values that look like attributes on an HTML tag.

In this exercise, we focus on customization and making the game look better using parameters.

## Customizing the board with parameters

Let's add some parameters for the colors on the board, and pass in some Groovy colors from the Pages/Index.razor page.

Parameters in Blazor are properties in our component that have been decorated with the Parameter attribute.

1. In Board.razor, let's define three properties for the board color, and each player's color. Before the OnInitialized method, let's add these lines of code:

    ```csharp
    [Parameter()]
    public Color BoardColor { get; set; } 
     = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("yellow");
    
    [Parameter()]
    public Color Player1Color { get; set; } 
     = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("red");
    
    [Parameter()]
    public Color Player2Color { get; set; }
     = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("blue");
    ```

    We use the `Color` type to ensure that the values passed to our Board component are in-fact colors. Let's also add a using statement to the top of the Board.razor file to indicate we're using content from the System.Drawing namespace.

1. @using System. Drawing
Let's now interpret the parameters and place their values in the CSS block at the top of Board.razor

    ```csharp
    <HeadContent>
     <style>
      :root {
       --board-bg: @ColorTranslator.ToHtml(BoardColor);
       --player1: @ColorTranslator.ToHtml(Player1Color);
       --player2: @ColorTranslator.ToHtml(Player2Color);
      }
     </style>
    </HeadContent>
    ```

    This change shouldn't have changed anything in the appearance of our game board.

    Let's head back to *Pages/Index.razor* and add some parameters to our `<Board>` tag and see how they change the game

    ```csharp
    <Board 
     BoardColor="@System.Drawing.Color.Black"
     Player1Color="@System.Drawing.Color.Green"
     Player2Color="@System.Drawing.Color.Purple"
    ></Board>
    ```

    Isn't that a cool looking board?
