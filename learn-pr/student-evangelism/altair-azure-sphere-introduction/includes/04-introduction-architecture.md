## Introduction to the cloud-connected Altair emulator on Azure Sphere

The core of the system is the Open Source Intel 8080 CPU emulator that runs compiled Intel 8080 binaries. Layered on the emulator is Altair BASIC and the CP/M operating system. On CP/M, three languages are available: BASIC, C, and Assembly.

- The solution integrates several Azure cloud services including:
  - Azure IoT Central to configure the Altair emulator and reporting.
  - An Azure Static Web App for the Altair Web Terminal
  - An Azure Virtual Machine. The virtual machine runs the virtual disk and MQTT broker services.

- The Altair emulator running on the Azure Sphere is accessible via a web browser-based terminal.

- The Altair emulator runs on the Azure Sphere Cortex A7. Depending on your hardware configuration, a virtual disk cache or SD Card server is running on one of the real-time Cortex M4 cores.

## The Altair emulator application architecture

The Altair emulator consists of two applications, one high-level application, and one real-time core application.

1. The **Altair emulator** high-level application is responsible for running the Altair emulator and managing communications.

    - The Altair project is a dual communications stack project. The built-in Azure IoT C SDK is used for communications with IoT Central. The Altair emulator's stdin, stdout, and disk requests are passed over MQTT and a back-end MQTT Broker.

1. The **Altair disk cache service** real-time application.

    - The disk cache service application provides Cache-Aside services using a Least Recently Used eviction policy for the Altair emulator virtual file system. The Altair emulator uses the cache to improve virtual disk performance. The cache-aside pattern is useful in a wide range of scenarios. For example, you could cache Price Look-Up codes for retail solutions.

1. The **Altair SD Card service** real-time application.

    - SD card support for the Altair emulator for the Avnet Azure Sphere Starter Kits with the MikroE microSD Click. The MikroE microSD Click must be plugged into socket 1 on the Avnet Azure Sphere Starter Kit.


## Altair Web Terminal

The cloud-connected Altair on Azure Sphere project connects to the Web Terminal by redirecting standard input and output over [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT?azure-portal=true). 

The Web Terminal is an HTML/CSS/JavaScript application built on the [MQTT](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/index.php?page=clients/js/index.php&azure-portal=true) and [Xterm](https://xtermjs.org?azure-portal=true) JavaScript libraries.

## Altair Web Terminal Azure Static Web Apps

The Altair Web Terminal is implemented as an [Azure Static Web App](/azure/static-web-apps?azure-portal=true).

In the following exercise, you'll learn how to deploy the Altair Web Terminal Static Web App.

## Altair virtual disk cache

Applications running on CP/M will have read/write access to drive B: enabling you can save files when the virtual disk server running. The virtual disk server can run on your desktop, or in a cloud-based Azure Virtual Machine.

Drive B: disk sector reads and writes are sent over MQTT to the Python-based virtual disk server. The disk sector **Cache-aside** cache is used to improve the performance of the virtual drive.
