Welcome to the "Learn Computing fundamentals with Altair 8800 emulator & Azure Sphere" learning path.

## Introduction

Welcome to the cloud-connected Altair 8800 on Azure Sphere learning path. You’ve come to the right place if you are interested in secure IoT devices and cloud computing. Not only do you get to learn about device and cloud computing, but you'll also get a taste of retro computing. You'll gain an understanding of the Altair 8800 personal computer, invented in the 1970s.

## Scenario: Curiosity

You've just read an article on the internet about the Altair 8800 personal computer, and it has captured your attention. The article says the Altair 8800 was invented nearly 50 years ago, and it was the computer that ignited the personal computer revolution. Now you’re curious how the Altair 8800 works, and how it can be programmed. You'd love to buy an Altair 8800, but they are expensive and difficult to find.

The Altair 8800 emulator running on Azure Sphere brings together retro computing, the modern world of IoT and cloud computing, and the chance to step back in time and program one of the first personal computers invented.

The Altair 8800 emulator provides the perfect platform to learn about the Altair 8800, how it works, and how it can be programmed. You'll get to program apps and games in Basic and C. For the more adventurous, you can code applications in Assembly language. Or you can take a notch deeper and program the Altair 8800 with Intel 8080 machine code.

## What will you learn?

In this module, you'll learn about the Azure Sphere, a platform for secure IoT, and the history of the Altair 8800, and the open-source Altair 8800 emulator. The Altair 8800 was invented well before the Internet as we know it today, and you'll learn techniques that you can apply to day-to-day IoT solutions.

## What is the main goal?

The module will focus on the end-to-end solution architecture of the Altair 8800 emulator running on Azure Sphere and how the Altair 8800 emulator is connected to Azure.
