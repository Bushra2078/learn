It takes years to develop plans for a successful and safe rocket launch. Because of this reality, NASA might have to choose a time and date to work toward several years before the actual rocket launch. If you have any experience with weather forecasts reported by your local weather person or meteorologist, you know that it can be a challenge to accurately predict weather just hours in advance.

Because large amounts of data are available in a digital world, weather predictions are more accurate than they were in the past, even taking into account a changing climate. But the stakes during a rocket launch are very high. If NASA schedules the launch on a day that has a weather event, the weather can be life-threatening.

To help predict and analyze weather data, NASA partners closely with [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/?azure-portal=true). NOAA shares its data with the public, so you can begin to analyze the patterns and make the predictions as NASA.

You can access NOAA data several ways. At [NOAA Data Access](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access?azure-portal=true), you can find [APIs](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface?azure-portal=true) that allow access through code. You can also download data at no cost, or even order hard copies for a small fee.

NASA also collects its own data, which it makes available to the public. At [Data.NASA.gov](https://nasa.github.io/data-nasa-gov-frontpage/?azure-portal=true), you can find tens of thousands of datasets. NASA also provides [developer resources](https://data.nasa.gov/stories/s/gk8h-th3y?azure-portal=true) for people who want to integrate NASA data into their applications.

Experts use this data to ensure the best prediction possible, and to select a safe launch date.
