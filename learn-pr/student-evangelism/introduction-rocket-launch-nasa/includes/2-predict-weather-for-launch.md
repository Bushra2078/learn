Plans for a rocket launch occur over the course of years. So, NASA might have to choose a time and date several years before launch. If you've ever seen your local weather person or meteorologist, you know that sometimes it's hard to accurately predict weather even hours in advance.

Because large amounts of data are now available, weather predictions are  more accurate than in the past, even taking into account the changing climate. But the stakes during a rocket launch are very high. It's not just that the astronauts might get cold because they didn't know they should bring a jacket. If NASA schedules the launch on the wrong day, it can be life-threatening.

To help predict and analyze weather data, NASA partners closely with [NOAA - the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/?azure-portal=true).  NOAA also shares data with the public, so you can start to analyze similar patterns and make similar predictions using their data.

NOAA lets you access their data in a number of ways. On the [NOAA Data Access page](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access?azure-portal=true), you can find [APIs](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface?azure-portal=true) that allow access through code. You can also download data at no cost, or even order hard copies for a small fee.

NASA also collects their own data that they make publicly available. At [Data.NASA.gov](https://nasa.github.io/data-nasa-gov-frontpage/?azure-portal=true), you can find tens of thousands of datasets. [NASA also provides developer resources](https://data.nasa.gov/stories/s/gk8h-th3y?azure-portal=true) for people who want to integrate NASA data into their applications.

Experts use this data to ensure the best prediction possible, and to select a safe launch date.
