Although historical and prediction data are critical, NASA must analyze a number of factors the day of a launch.

NASA collects data from a wide array of sources, including these sources:

- [High-atmospheric scientific balloons](https://www.nasa.gov/scientificballoons?azure-portal=true)
- [NOAA weather](https://www.noaa.gov/weather?azure-portal=true)
- [Satellite imagery](https://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/GOES/?azure-portal=true)
- [Remote sensors](https://nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov/learn/remote-sensors?azure-portal=true)
- Weather pattern experts

Here are some key factors that NASA takes into account regarding launches:

- Surface electric field
- Time
- Distance
- Cloud temperature
- Precipitation intensity
- Rocket velocity

The 45th Space Wing is a division of the U.S. Air Force that focuses on space exploration and weather as it relates to successful rocket launches. This division has created an [easy-to-follow graphic](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/LaunchForecastFAQ/?azure-portal=true) that shows some of the critical criteria to consider for a safe rocket launch.

## The importance of clouds

Temperature and lightning are substantial weather factors when it comes to a rocket launch. Each rocket has different temperature requirements, depending on how it was built and the rocket's cargo. Because of this, the precise criteria depends on the rocket, and it's proprietary information. But generally, there are thresholds for temperature that lead to success or failure in a launch.

No lightning during a launch, as you might guess, also is critical. Because rockets are highly conductive, the potential for lightning is extremely high and dangerous. Under certain conditions, a rocket launch itself might even generate lightning.

The shape and composition of clouds are indicators of the likelihood of lightning occurring. These are primary factors in determining whether a rocket is allowed to launch and the trajectory it takes.
