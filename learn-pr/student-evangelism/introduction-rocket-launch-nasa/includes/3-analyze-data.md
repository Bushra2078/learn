While historical and prediction data are critical, there are also a number of factors that need to be analyzed on the day of a launch.

NASA collects data from a wide array of sources, including:

- [High-atmospheric Scientific Balloons](https://www.nasa.gov/scientificballoons?azure-portal=true)
- [NOAA Weather](https://www.noaa.gov/weather?azure-portal=true)
- [Satellite imagery](https://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/GOES/?azure-portal=true)
- [Remote sensors](https://nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov/learn/remote-sensors?azure-portal=true)
- Weather pattern experts

Some key factors that NASA takes into account regarding launches are:

- Surface electric field
- Time
- Distance
- Cloud temperature
- Precipitation intensity
- Rocket velocity

The 45th Space Wing is a division of the United States Air Force that focuses on space exploration and weather relating to successful rocket launches. This division has created an [easy-to-follow graphic](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/LaunchForecastFAQ/?azure-portal=true) that shows some of the critical criteria to consider for a safe launch.

## The importance of clouds

Temperature and lightning are huge factors in rocket launches. Each rocket has different temperature requirements, depending on how it was built and the cargo. And so the exact criteria depends on the rocket and proprietary information. But generally, there are thresholds for temperature that lead to the success or failure of a launch.

A lack of lightning, as you can guess, is also critical. Because rockets are highly conductive, the potential for lightning is  extremely dangerous. Under certain conditions, a rocket launch can even generate lightning.

The shape and composition of clouds indicate the likelihood of lightning. These are primary factors in determining whether a rocket is allowed to launch and the trajectory it takes.
