NASA collects data from many different sources to help determine if the conditions are safe for rocket launches. For both crewed and uncrewed launches, it's important that weather conditions won't disrupt the rocket's trajectory and speed as on it's journey through the atmosphere into space.

NASA considers certain places safe for a rocket to enter space. To access these places, rockets must be launched from specific locations on Earth. To increase the chance of success, rockets should enter space  as close to the equator as possible. Furthermore, if a launch needs to be aborted, it's safest over a large body of water.

Cape Canaveral incorporates all these features.

Cape Canaveral is on the East coast of the Florida peninsula. The area experiences hurricanes, rain storms, and humidity - all factors that can cause issues during a rocket launch. Why not just launch from somewhere with no inclement weather, like San Diego, California? For other reasons, Cape Canaveral is most often the best US-based launch site  for maintaining the correct trajectory for entering space.

There are many potential factors at play. NASA has to take into account many different data sources to get the most accurate picture of what the rocket will have to endure on its 100 kilometer journey into space.
