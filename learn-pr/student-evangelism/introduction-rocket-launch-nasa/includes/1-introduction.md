NASA collects data from a lot of different sources to help determine if the conditions are safe for rocket launches. For both crewed and uncrewed launches, it's important that weather conditions won't disrupt the rocket's trajectory and speed as on it's journey through the atmosphere into space.

NASA considers certain places safe for a rocket to enter space. To access these places, rockets must be be launched from specific locations on Earth. To increase the chance of success, rockets should enter space  as close to the equator as possible. Furthermore, if a launch needs to be aborted, it's safest over a large body of water.

Cape Canaveral incorporates all these features.

Cape Canaveral is on the East coast of the Florida peninsula in the southern part of the United States. Near the Caribbean, this area experiences hurricanes, rain storms, and humidity - all factors that can cause issues during a rocket launch. Why not just launch from somewhere with no inclement weather, like San Diego, California? For other reasons, Cape Canaveral is most often the best launch location in the United States for maintaining the correct trajectory for entering space.

With so many potential factors at play, NASA has to take into account many different data sources to get the most accurate picture of what the rocket will have to endure on it's 100-kilometer (62-mile) journey into space.
