Lastly, it's important to understand that ethics play a role in every part of the data science lifecycle. You should consider the ethics of your decisions in each step. It begins with your central question and progresses through to the availability of your model.

In the berry example from the previous unit, you discovered that a significant piece of  data was missing from the training and testing datasets. You didn't know about thimbleberries. While a particular type of berry might seem trivial, this phenomenon represents a much larger problem. In recent studies, huge populations of people were omitted from initial data collection. The absence of this data can skew results and even be life-threatening. For example, did you know that men and women exhibit vastly different heart attack symptoms?

## Handling ethics around rocket launch safety predictions

Even without all of knowledge and expertise of the incredible NASA scientists and collaborators that ensure the highest probability of a safe and successful launch, you can try to be as ethical as possible with the limited data available.

In the remaining modules of this Learning Path, you'll explore how publicly available weather data can help you understand what a successful launch day looks like. There are 64 crewed and un-crewed rocket launches in the data set. With this data, you'll be able to look at the weather on those 64 days to try to get an accurate understanding of what a successful launch day looks like. However, the data set only contains one "unsuccessful" rocket launch that was pushed back due to weather.

Think about the thimbleberry example. The analysis that you'll perform isn't one that NASA would use when real lives were at risk. This analysis is an introduction into the type of analysis that could be used as a starting point, but significantly more data and subject matter expertise would be required before it should be used for any kind of real decision making.

If you don't have a complete representation of data, then you won't know when to look out for new categories. With the berry example, you're missing thimbleberries. With the NASA data, you're missing  pushed launched dates. This is why data science problems require so much rigor and iterations. With each new level of knowledge we gain from our data, we learn what other data might be missing, what new questions to ask, and how we might prioritize the data to yield more accurate understandings of the world around us.
