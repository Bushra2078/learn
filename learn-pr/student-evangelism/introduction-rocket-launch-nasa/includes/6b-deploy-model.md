Step 4 in the data science lifecycle is to deploy your machine learning model. 

Finally, when your model is trained and tested, you can deploy your model, both to use it for your own data science projects, and to share it with others. 

When your model is deployed, it's available to use with other software. For example, you can create a website tn which a user can upload a picture of a berry and the site identifies the type of berry is in the photo. The possibilities are vast.
