  questions:
  - content: "Computers will always be more accurate than humans at data analysis."
    choices:
    - content: "This statement is true because computers are purely logical, so they can't make mistakes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, because computers must be programmed by humans."
    - content: "This statement is true because computers can process significantly more data than humans, and faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's a true statement, but it doesn't mean that computers are more accurate than humans."
    - content: "This statement is false because computers can't understand context, so they can't be accurate all the time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning makes it possible for computers to understand context."
    - content: "This statement is false because computers are as accurate as software built by humans can make them."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Computers are only accurate if the programming is accurate."
  - content: "What are the four steps in the data science lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "Business Understanding, Data Gathering and Preparation, Model Training and Testing, Model Deployment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! These are the exact four steps"
    - content: "Data Gathering, Data Validation, Machine Learning, Result Visualization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect; the data science lifecycle doesn't include these four steps."
    - content: "Data Identification, Model Training until 100% Accurate, Model Deployment, Business Understanding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect; the data science lifecycle doesn't include these four steps."
    - content: "Machine Learning Algorithm Coding, Data Exploration, Algorithm Modifications, Report Generation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect; the data science lifecycle doesn't include these four steps."
