quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Are computers always more accurate than humans at data analysis? Why or why not?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. Computers can process much more data than humans, and they can process it faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Computers can process more data, and faster, but they aren't more accurate than their design."
    - content: "No. Computers can't understand context, so they can't be accurate all the time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning makes it possible for computers to understand context."
    - content: "No. Computers are only as accurate as the humans that program them."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Computers are accurate only if their programming is accurate."
  - content: "What are the four steps in the data science lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "Business understanding, data gathering and preparation, model training and testing, model deployment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! These steps describe the data science lifecycle."
    - content: "Data gathering, data validation, machine learning, result visualization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These steps don't describe the data science lifecycle."
    - content: "Data identification, model training until 100% accurate, model deployment, business understanding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These steps don't describe the data science lifecycle."
  - content: "What is overfitting in machine learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "When your machine learning model takes up most of the disk space on your server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Overfitting in a machine learning model doesn't refer to software or disk size."
    - content: "When your machine learning model is so broad, it misidentifies a new item as something it has been trained on."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Overfitting means that your model hasn't been trained enough to recognize a new item."
    - content: "When your machine learning model easily handles new types of items; it's a good thing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Overfitting in a machine learning model indicates insufficient training and inaccuracy in the model."
  - content: "What is the goal of manipulating data in data science?"
    choices:
    - content: "To eliminate data that will make it harder to prove what you think must be true."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data is manipulated to discover what truth the data points to."
    - content: "To remove incomplete data, so it doesn't skew the output away from the truth."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Output is based on input. You manipulate data to remove input that won't lead to accurate output."
    - content: "To clean up your results, so they are summarized and easy to present."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You manipulate data before you get results by making sure that your inputs are valid."
  - content: "What is the role of subject matter expert (SMEs) in the data science lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "SMEs help set the scope of data analysis by identifying factors that will affect the outcome."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! SMEs can help you know which factors matter and which are too insignificant to measure."
    - content: "SMEs add the seal of approval on the results that your data points to."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SMEs influence your results before you even evaluate your data and produce a result."
    - content: "SMEs help you interpret your data in the context of their specialties."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In the data science lifecycle, SMEs help you select the inputs to use in your analysis."
