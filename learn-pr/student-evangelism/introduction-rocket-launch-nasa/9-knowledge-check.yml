  Answer the following questions to see what you've learned.  
quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Will computers always be more accurate than humans at data analysis? Why or why not?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes, because computers are purely logical. They don't make mistakes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, because computers must be programmed by humans."
    - content: "Yes, because computers can process significantly more data than humans, and faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Computers can process more data, faster. But, they aren't more accurate than humans."
    - content: "No, because computers can't understand context, so they can't be accurate all the time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning makes it possible for computers to understand context."
    - content: "No, because computers are as accurate as the software built by humans can make them."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Computers are only accurate if the programming is accurate."
  - content: "What are the four steps in the data science lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "Business understanding, data gathering and preparation, model training and testing, model deployment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! These are the exact four steps."
    - content: "Data gathering, data validation, machine learning, result visualization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data science lifecycle doesn't include these four steps."
    - content: "Data identification, model training until 100% accurate, model deployment, business understanding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data science lifecycle doesn't include these four steps."
    - content: "Machine learning algorithm coding, data exploration, algorithm modifications, report generation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data science lifecycle doesn't include these four steps."
