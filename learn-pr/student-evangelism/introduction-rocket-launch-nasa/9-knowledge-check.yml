  Answer the following questions to see what you've learned.  
quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Are computers always more accurate than humans at data analysis? Why or why not?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes, because computers can process much more data than humans, and they can process it faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Computers can process more data, and faster. But, they aren't more accurate than the humans that program them."
    - content: "No, because computers can't understand context, so they can't be accurate all the time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning makes it possible for computers to understand context."
    - content: "No, because computers are as accurate as the software built by humans can make them."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Computers are only accurate if the programming is accurate."
  - content: "What are the four steps in the data science lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "Business understanding, data gathering and preparation, model training and testing, model deployment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! These steps describe the data science lifecycle."
    - content: "Data gathering, data validation, machine learning, result visualization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data science lifecycle doesn't include these four steps."
    - content: "Data identification, model training until 100% accurate, model deployment, business understanding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data science lifecycle doesn't include these four steps."
  - content: "What is overfitting in a machine learning model?"
    choices:
    - content: "When your machine learning model takes up too much space on your computer or server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Overfitting in a machine learning model doesn't refer to software or disk size."
    - content: "When your machine learning model is so broad, it inaccurately identifies a new item as something it knows."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Overfitting means that your model hasn't seen enough during training to recognize a new item."
    - content: "When your machine learning model easily absorbs new task, so it's a good thing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Overfitting in a machine learning model is a weakness that's related to insufficient training of the model."
  - content: "What does is the goal of manipulating data in data science?"
    choices:
    - content: "To dispose of data that will make it harder to prove what you think must be true."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manipulating data is done to discover what truth the data reveals."
    - content: "To remove incomplete data, so it doesn't skew the output away from the truth."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Output is based on input. You manipulate data to remove input that won't lead to accurate output."
    - content: "To clean up your results, so they are summarized and easy to read."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manipulating data occurs before you reach a conclusion, while you are making sure your inputs are valid."
  - content: "What is the role of a subject matter expert (SME) in the data science lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "SMEs help set the scope of data analysis by helping you determine which measurable factors will have an effect on outcome."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A SME can help you know which factors matter and which are too insignificant to measure."
    - content: "SMEs add the seal of approval on the results that your data points to."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The influence of SMEs is seen before you even evaluate your data and produce a result."
    - content: "SMEs help you interpret your data in the context of their specialties."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In the data science lifecycle, SMEs help you narrow and accurately select the inputs to use in your analysis."
