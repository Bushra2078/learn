We have covered lots of computational techniques and statistical ideas in this module and here are some of the topics you covered in the module.

- You have learnt the basics of  A/B tests and how to run an A/B tests on datasets.
- You have learnt how to use causality by using randomized controlled trial (RCTs).
- You have learnt the basics of the the Bootstrap Method: The ideas behind it, what it is, and why it works.
- You have learnt about confidence intervals, understanding confidence levels, generating confidence intervals, and how to use them to estimate unknown parameters.

The Bootstrap method is a brilliant way to generate new random samples to analyze when it's not feasible to go out and generate new samples as is often the case in the real world as it's generally quite hard and expensive to get good unbiased samples. This makes it another extremely powerful and useful tool now at your disposal after completing this module.
