We have covered lots of computational techniques and statistical ideas in this module and here are some of the topics you covered in the module.

- You have learned the basics of A/B tests and how to run an A/B test on datasets.
- You have learned how to use causality by using randomized controlled trial (RCTs).
- You have learned the basics of the bootstrap method: The ideas behind it, what it is, and why it works.
- You have learned about confidence intervals, understanding confidence levels, generating confidence intervals, and how to use them to estimate unknown parameters.

The Bootstrap method is a brilliant way to generate new random samples to analyze when it's not feasible to go out and generate new samples as is often the case in the real world as it's generally hard and expensive to get good unbiased samples. This makes it another powerful and useful tool now at your disposal after completing this module.
