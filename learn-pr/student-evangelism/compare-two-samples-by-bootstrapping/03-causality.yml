content: 'In 2013, a Berkeley chemical engineering professor, Jay Keasling, discovered a synthetic version of artemisinin - a chemical crucial to producing antimalarial drugs. A group of researchers and statisticians come together to test the effectiveness of this new chemical, which is being used to treat malaria in developing countries.

A random sample of 500 malaria patients are randomly assigned to take either the antimalarial drug or a placebo pill. It turns out that among the patients who took the drug, a much larger proportion recovered from malaria than among those who took the placebo. Meanwhile, cases of malaria are decreasing in developing nations, and some suggest that this might be because of the increased effectiveness of mosquito nets being distributed.'
quiz:
  questions:
    - content: 'What kind of study is this?'
      choices:
        - content: 'randomized controlled experiment.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct, a treatment group and control group are clearly defined.
        - content: 'observational study'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect
        - content: 'survey of a simple random sample'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'Does the study indicates that taking the drug causes an increase in recovery rates among malaria patients? If yes/no, why?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Yes since it is an experiment'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: 'No since correlation does not imply causation'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: 'No since there might be confounding variables'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The random assignment of test subjects into treatment and control groups eliminate confounding variables.
    - content: 'Are the improvements in mosquito nets a confounding factor in this experiment.'
      choices:
        - content: 'Yes, since we did not keep that variable the same'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: 'No, since that variable is kept the same among treatment and control groups'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: 'No, since the patients in the study already have malaria'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'We are able to establish causality because itâ€™s a randomized controlled experiment. A much larger proportion recovered from malaria than among those who took the placebo. This statement indicates that there is a significant difference--greater than the difference observed if there was hypothetically no causation, between those who took the drug and those who took the pill. Also, the patients already have malaria, so the mosquito nets do not act as confounding variables.'
