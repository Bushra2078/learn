title: Compare two samples by bootstrapping
summary: Learn how to test hypothesis about samples using bootstrapping
abstract: |
  The UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational 
  thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that 
  data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming 
  and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, 
  document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data 
  analysis such as privacy and design.
  
  ***Produced in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley - Ani Adhikari and John Denero with Contributions from David Wagner [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html).*** 

  In this module, you will:
  - Study A/B tests and how to run an A/B test.
  - Prove causality with randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
  - Understand the Bootstrap: The idea behind it, what it is, and why it works.
  - Learn about confidence intervals: understanding confidence levels, generating confidence intervals, and how to use them to estimate unknown parameters.
prerequisites: None
