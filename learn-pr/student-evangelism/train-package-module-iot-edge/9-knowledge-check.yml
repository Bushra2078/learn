  questions:
  - content: "A company is deploying a machine learning models to edge devices in production. The company must deploy the model to a variety of development hardware environments. Currently, they are creating specific implementation per environment. This causes issues with dependencies. What alternate method could they use to manage dependencies?"
    choices:
    - content: "The company could use a webservice."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use of webservices won't help ."
    - content: "The company could use specific libraries per environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The company could use containers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The use of libraries helps managing dependencies"
  - content: "The workflow for deploying models in production is:"
    choices:
    - content: "Register the model - Prepare to deploy - Deploy the model to the compute target - Test the deployed model as a web service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "We first register the model and ultimately deploy to a webservice."
    - content: "Prepare to deploy - Register the model - Deploy the model to the compute target - Test the deployed model as a web service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A model that is built should be registered first."
    - content: "Deploy the model to the compute target - Register the model - Prepare to deploy - Test the deployed model as a web service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The module must always be registered first."
  - content: "After the model is packaged in a container, which of these steps could be undertaken to optimize performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "The model is retrained."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The model can't be retrained once packaged as a container."
    - content: "The model is profiled for ideal CPU and memory usage."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Profiling for ideal CPU and memory usage helps to deploy to the target audience."
    - content: "The model features are reengineered to optimize performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The data can't be feature engineered after it is packaged in a container."
