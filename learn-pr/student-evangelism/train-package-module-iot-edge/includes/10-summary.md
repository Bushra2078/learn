Consider the scenario from the previous section. Your objective is to deploy trained machine learning models in production on edge devices in a scalable way. You can build and train the model using traditional techniques. In the absence of a container-based deployment strategy, you would struggle to work with a variety of dependencies to cater for multiple target deployments to the edge. By deploying the anomaly detector as a container, you can overcome the challenges of deploying to complex edge environments at scale
