  Answer the following questions to see what you've learned.  
quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Why did we choose a decision tree for our machine learning algorithm?"
    choices:
    - content: "A decision tree is the most complex and accurate algorithm."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Decision trees aren't the most complex and accurate algorithm."
    - content: "A decision tree is easy to visualize. It fits well because the model can make only two choices: yes or no."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! We chose a decision tree because a decision tree is easy to visualize. It's easy to use because the model can make only two choices."
    - content: "A decision tree has lots of branches, and the model can make lots of choices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In a decision tree, the model can make only two choices: yes or no."
