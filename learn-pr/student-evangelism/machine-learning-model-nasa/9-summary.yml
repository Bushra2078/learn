  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Why did we choose a decision tree for our machine learning algorithm?"
    choices:
    - content: "A decision tree is the most complex and accurate algorithm."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect; decisions trees are not the most complex and accurate algorithm."
    - content: "A decision tree is easy to visualize, and it fits well because the model can make only two choices: yes or no."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! We chose a decision tree because a decision tree is easy to visualize, and it's easy to use because the model can make only two choices."
    - content: "A decision tree has lots of branches and the model can make lots of choices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect; in a decision tree, the model can make only two choices: yes or no."
