This module provides examples of how educators implement certification courses by using different implementation approaches, like offering certification as a standalone course or offering certification alongside a course.

Designing curricula by using a blended approach of academic and certification learning materials results in graduates who have academic knowledge and understanding coupled with the practical skillsets that certification offers. When educators implement certification for academic credit, they need to ensure that academic learning outcomes are covered and mapped to relevant certification outcomes.

Using knowledge gained from this module and insight from the University of Lincoln case study, you can consider how to implement certification in your program curricula.
