Since you will be creating a Power App and a Copilot Studio with generative AI capabilities, you will need some services in place to get started. Here, we'll discuss the project scenario and specification and the things you'll need to get started.

## Project specification

Let's discuss a more detailed project description for the use case in consideration - 'Build an AI Powered Workplace Helper App'.

## Contoso Company

Your customer is Contoso, a fictitious multi-national company with several employees and offices worldwide. Due to the company's size, employees often do not know where to find the information they need to answer their questions. The local Contoso office has contracted you to help make it easier for their employees to get answers to administrative questions, policy and procedure information, and what to do in an emergency. The app should use existing policy documents, websites, and resources that already contain the necessary information but give employees a quick and easy way to ask specific questions to get answers rather than having to read through all the information. Safety is very important to Contoso, so they also want to ensure that the bot will provide specified local information quickly if it is asked for emergency contact information.

You decide the best solution is to create a Power App for the organization with a chatbot that uses a Copilot Studio with generative AI capabilities. This will use the existing documents as a data source, as well as allow you to specify responses with local emergency contact details via topic-based answers.

## Brief requirement

- Users can ask the app free-form questions about Contoso policies and receive answers and links.
- Users receive specified local emergency contact information if they use the trigger words "fire", "police", "ambulance", or "emergency".
- Generative answers should also be provided after the specified local emergency contact information for questions using the emergency trigger words.
- On the main screen, the app should have the name of the city for which this app was created.
- Be creative with additional features to make the app or chatbot more useful.
