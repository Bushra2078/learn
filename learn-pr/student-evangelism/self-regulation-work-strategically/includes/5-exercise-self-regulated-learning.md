In this exercise, you will go through some scenarios and reflect to what degree self-regulated is being applied.

## Reflect on self-regulated learning to solve problems

Imagine you’re mentoring some of your team members to help them approach training strategically. Take a moment to read each of the following scenarios, in which you’re interacting with team members. Use the questions after each scenario to reflect on how self-regulated learning is (or isn’t) being applied. Optionally, note your thoughts on a device or paper.

### Scenario 1

A team member asks you for help during the training session. You ask to review the pseudocode for the program they’re working on. They spend a few minutes searching for it in a pile of disorganized notes. They tell you, “I’ve spent more time on this program than I expected to. I keep feeling like I’m starting from scratch. I’m just not getting anywhere.”

#### Scenario 1 reflective questions

- What’s the significance of the learner’s disorganization?

    - Possible answer: One way to work strategically is to keep notes about what you're doing and how your approach is working. This learner has disorganized notes. This could mean that they’re approaching the task in a haphazard way.

- Why and how do you think it’s contributing to the learner’s feelings about their progress?

    - Possible answer: Because their disorganized notes make it difficult to review what they’ve done, they don’t recognize the progress that they’ve made.

- What steps should you suggest they take to approach the training more strategically?

    - Possible answer: You could suggest that they start a log in which they report the steps that they’re taking. Suggest that they record their plan and whether their steps are successful. Explain that this will help them accurately assess their progress.

### Scenario 2

Part of the training requires that team members work in groups to develop and test practice code. One team seems excited about their design and subsequent implementation. When they run the program, their excitement fades as they count the runtime errors. You overhear one person remark, “I just want to give up. Our design was perfect!”

#### Scenario 2 reflective questions

- Why are the team members feeling deflated? 

    - Possible answer: They expected the code to work the first time. When it didn’t, they were disappointed.

- Where are they in their self-regulated feedback loop? What’s their next step?

    - Possible answer: They are in the “act” or “try” portion, where they have tested their plan and have results from that test. The next step is to modify their plan and test it again. In this case, that means modifying their code and run the program again.

- What can you say to help them to move forward?

    - Possible answer: Remind them that failure is a part of learning, and is normal and even expected. Suggest that they write down what they think went wrong and what they need to do to adjust the code. Then, recommend that they modify the code, run the program again, and determine whether it works. Tell them to continue taking notes and following the iterative process, making changes to the code and implementing the changes until they’re successful.

### Scenario 3

A team member participating in training is struggling with an in-course task and asks you for help. The task is to write down the high-level steps for a code procedure, called *pseudocode*. The team member can articulate the code’s objectives but is reluctant to write down the steps. They explain, “I won’t really know if this is going to work until I try it.”

#### Scenario 3 reflective questions

- Why might the team member feel reluctant about committing to the steps of the pseudocode? 

    - Possible answer: They might feel that the plan they write down must work before they document it; they only want to write it down when they can guarantee it works successfully.

- What can you say to help them work more strategically?

    - Possible answer: You could reassure them that plans are rarely 100 percent correct. Explain that most plans change a little (or a lot) during development. Remind them of the three-step iterative feedback loop. The pseudocode is only a starting plan that they’ll typically adjust if or when parts of it don’t work.

### Scenario 4

You notice a team member trying to debug a portion of code. They’re making frequent revisions to it and get errors every time they run it. They spend almost the entire lab time on one portion of code and grow increasingly stressed and upset. 

#### Scenario 4 reflective questions

- What can you suggest to the team member that’ll help them work the problem strategically?

      - Possible answer: You could suggest that they keep a list or log of what they’ve tried to fix and note what the result was of each change they made.

- Where are they in their self-regulated feedback loop? 

    - Possible answer: They are in the “act” or “try” portion. They’ll need to continue trying different options until they’re successful.

- What parts of the self-regulated feedback loop are they missing? How could they benefit from doing those parts? 

    - Possible answer: They aren’t keeping track of what they’re doing and whether their steps are successful. That, in turn, means they’re not using that data to modify their plan. If they mindfully modify their plan based on their results, they would be working strategically. Even if their problem didn’t get solved, they’d still have a tangible record of what they tried, what they learned from trying, and whether the results were successful.
