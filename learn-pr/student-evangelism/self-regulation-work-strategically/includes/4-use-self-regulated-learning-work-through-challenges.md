To work through the challenges of training and the project, you and your team need a process to plan, test, and revise your approach. As a team lead, you want to know how to support your team members while they’re in training. 

## Self-regulated learning

Imagine you're working on a project and realize that you’ve tried the same solution, which isn’t working, over and over. You’re  hoping that “this time it’ll work!” By applying your metacognition, you recognize that you’re “spinning your wheels” and pause, regroup, and make a plan. You then can try your plan and evaluate how successful it was. Based on the results of your evaluation, revise the plan, and try it again. This iterative process is called *self-regulated learning*.

*Self-regulated learning* is a systematic, goal-oriented, behavior-based learning strategy. When you practice self-regulated learning, you can become a strategic and effective learner. Its approach is similar to the scientific method. It uses a three-phase iterative feedback loop:

1. Plan. Set a goal and figure out how to approach it. As yourself, “What’s my goal? What strategy will I use?”

1. Do. Try the plan and record the result. Ask yourself, “Did it work?”

1. Evaluate. Examine your notes about what you tried. Ask yourself, “What worked? What should I change?” If your plan wasn’t as successful as you wanted, use the information you gathered in steps 2 and 3 to modify the plan, and then try it again.

## Supporting self-regulated learning in others

When you're in a role of mentor or leader, you can encourage self-regulated learning in others to help them be more successful learners. You can act as a *mirror* or a coach, give them feedback on their work, and help them strategize about their process. 

> [!TIP] 
> To act as a mirror when mentoring, be fully present to the person talking to you and actively listen to them. Confirm your understanding of what they said by telling them what they said. This also helps clarify their perspective for them.

The first step when mentoring is to understand their issues so you can guide them to a strategic approach. Recognize that they might be stressed already by the time they get to you. You might need to pause and assess their perspective. You can ask “Can you name what’s difficult?” Or ask “What assumptions are you making about this activity? What if you did not assume that?”

Invite them to try different perspectives by suggesting they observe from another vantage point or talk to someone who has a different perspective. Ask them to consider the problem differently by saying, “Is there another way to think about this?”

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During this process, reassure the person that there are no wrong answers.

If you sense that they have a negative inner dialogue, try to give them another, more positive script. For example, maybe they say, “I can’t check my own work, I’ll just miss all the errors.” You then can suggest that “You can do it. You can get better at finding errors with practice.”

## Approaches to strategically work through challenges

You can help others strategically work through tasks that seem difficult or overwhelming. Here are some approaches to try:

- Help a learner identify what plan they used. They might not think about their approach as a formalized plan.

- Ask clarifying questions such as, “Can you take me through your process? Tell me more about why you did this step next.”

- Provide useful feedback about their strategy such as, “Was there was a missed step? Can you recommend another approach?” 

- Work with them to break down an overwhelming task into smaller, achievable tasks.

- Encourage them to use an iterative feedback loop to try their plan, assess it, adjust the plan, and test again. 

- Suggest they pay attention to their thoughts and actions to become aware of feelings of panic, “wheel spinning,” and unproductive time. 

- To help track events, testing and results, and troubleshoot problems, suggest they keep a log. Recommend that they review it with a mentor to get feedback.

- Suggest they pair up with another learner who has different skills and strengths. They can learn from, and help each other, and practice cooperation and working collaboratively.

- Encourage them to ask someone on another team who has done the task before to review their notes. Or recommend they ask that person for advice.

The process of self-regulated learning isn’t developed overnight. However, people can improve their strategic approach through practice and feedback. By engaging in this practice and encouraging others to do it, too, you’re building a positive culture for learning through trial and error. Everyone can benefit from this practice.
