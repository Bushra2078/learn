In this exercise, you will read a set of statements and decide if these statements apply to you to a varying degree.

## How do you approach challenges?

Read each statement and decide if it’s “more like” or “less like” you. Optionally, note your answers on a device or paper:

|Statement  |More like you  |Less like you  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|I like to create a plan before jumping into a complex project.     |         |         |
|I tend to randomly try different approaches rather than systematically trying approaches and documenting their outcomes.     |         |         |
|I can step back and troubleshoot how I’m thinking about a project.     |         |         |
|I can spend hours on something, come up empty handed, and not know how I spent the time.     |         |         |
|I find it hard to keep my motivation when I encounter a setback.     |         |         |
|I spend a lot of energy worrying about deadlines.     |         |         |
