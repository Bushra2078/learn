The abilities to strategize problem-solving and learning can help you effectively work through challenges. Use goal orientation to discover your learning motivation while using self-regulated learning to create, test, evaluate, and refine your plan.

## Scenario: Team leader cloud-based services

Imagine that you’re a team leader in an organization that provides cloud-based services. All team members are participating in training that will teach them necessary skills to work on a challenging project. 

However, there’s a general frustration with the project and the training. Members of your team tell you that they feel overwhelmed and disorganized, and don’t feel they’re making progress with the project compared to how much time they’ve spent on it. One team member doubts their abilities and questions whether they should be on the team. However, other team members are excited about the training because they want to learn new skills. Others aren’t participating fully because they’re afraid of making mistakes or that their teammates will think they’re unprepared or not very good at their jobs.

You need to figure out why certain team members are stuck and overwhelmed. You’ll then adjust the training to maximize its effectiveness and provide team members methods to learn effectively and strategically approach the training and project.

In this module, you’ll learn about using self-regulation to respond effectively to challenges. You'll also use goal-orientation theory to diagnose what motivates you to learn.

## What will you learn?

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Respond effectively to challenges using self-regulation, metacognition, and emotional intelligence.
- Solve problems strategically by using self-regulated learning and its three-step iterative process.
- Apply goal orientation to affect motivation and persistence.
- Foster self-regulation and self-regulated learning in others.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to apply self-regulated learning to strategically approach problem-solving, and support self-regulation in others.

## Prerequisites

To get the best learning experience from this module, you should have an open mind and a willingness to learn about the expectations and responsibilities of managing, mentoring, or collaborating with others in a technology workspace or educational environment.
