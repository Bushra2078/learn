In this module, we explored the concepts of web accessibility. You learned about:

- Tools that users use to browse through webpages.
- Tools that developers use to ensure accessibility.
- Skills for ensuring that your pages are accessible.

## Challenge

The best way to understand how to make pages accessible, and the impact of the decisions that you make when creating HTML, is to use some of the tools that users use to browse the web. 

Move through a couple of pages by using a screen reader. Open a website that has a form and use only your keyboard to complete it. This activity will give you a sense of what some users experience on a daily basis when using the web, and the importance of ensuring that your pages are accessible.
