Programming (also known as coding) is the process of writing instructions to a device, such as a computer or mobile device. 

We write these instructions by using a programming language, which is then interpreted by the device. These sets of instructions may be referred to by various names. A few popular names are *program*, *computer program*, *application* (app), and *executable*.

## A program

A program can be anything that is written with code. A few examples of programs that run on different devices are:

- Websites
- Games
- Phone apps

<!-- TODO: suggest we add some art here, mobile device or something showing a program running. -->

Although it's possible to create a program without writing code, the underlying logic is interpreted to the device and that logic was most likely written with code. A program that runs or executes code is carrying out instructions. The device that you're currently using to read this module is running a program that prints it to your screen.
