Despite having ground rules at the coding camp, sometimes people say something seemingly hostile or insensitive. This unit explores other strategies that you can employ to improve active listening and effective communication. These strategies will help you and the camp participants navigate awkward situations and work better together.

## Examine strategies for navigating difficult situations

People inherently have different ways of communicating. Often, a comment made by one group member can be taken in a negative way by another. Active listening is especially important in the field of computer science and technology because some people might not have enough experience or knowledge of a subject to frame their thoughts clearly. By practicing some of the following strategies, you can improve the communication between your camp participants and better navigate any difficult moments that arise.

### Acknowledge what happened

If there's a conflict between team members, the first step is to acknowledge the occurrence of that uncomfortable moment. Don't try to ignore the event in the hope that it might pass and be forgotten. Make sure the team members who were hurt know that you spotted the interaction and aren't complicit by your silence or inaction. You can discuss the incident with the affected parties and let them know your acknowledgment of the situation.

> You could start the conversation by saying, "I can tell this incident is bringing up a lot of feelings and opinions."

### Pause the discussion

Taking a break or pausing the discussion might help people cool down and reflect on their recent interactions. If possible, provide a moment for people to internally note their thoughts and feelings. In some situations, you might need to stop the discussion to interrupt the thought process and enforce some silence. This break will give people a chance to process the recent conversation.

> You can pause a conversation by saying something like:
> - "Let's take a short break."
> - "Let's come back to that because we can't address it right now, but I think it should be addressed."

### Ask a clarifying question

Sometimes, it might help to restate the recent dialogue in your own words to clarify the intent. Misunderstandings can often be resolved by explaining the original statements. You can ask:

- "I'm hearing a connection between these two things. Is that what you were trying to communicate?"
- "Can you tell me more about how you generated that idea?"

### Ask what can be done privately vs. as a group

It helps to analyze the temperament of the people involved in the interactions. Some might be more receptive to opening up privately, while others might be comfortable expressing themselves openly in front of the group.

Offer separate conversations to the person hurt by a comment and the person who made the comment. They might have an easier time being honest if they don't have to do so in the presence of the group.

> The group might also need to collectively revisit the ground rules. Reevaluating the rules based on the evolving dynamics of a group might alleviate further potential for awkward interactions.

## Identify advantages and limitations of small group discussions

There might be circumstances when it's a good idea to break a larger group discussion into smaller groups. Some advantages of having small group discussions are:

- They encourage participation from people who are shy or uncomfortable when sharing in larger groups.
- They allow more people to share because fewer conversations are happening simultaneously.
- People are more likely to bond or connect in a pair or a small group.

Some limitations of having small group discussions are:

- The larger group can't always benefit from the comments shared in a smaller group.
- It might be difficult for facilitators to monitor and mediate. People are more apt to express their feelings openly in a smaller group. This tendency can increase the chances of the discussion getting out of control or going off in an unintended direction.
- There's a higher potential of interpersonal friction and power imbalance. In a smaller group, there might be more chances of two or more people not getting along with each other or disagreeing with each other in a more fractious manner.

## Follow tips for managing group discussions

Managing group discussions can take some practice. The tips in the following table can help.

| **Tip**                                    | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Break into small groups.                  | Break the large group into smaller groups of three to five people. Provide them with the opportunity to discuss a prompt, answer a question, and brainstorm. |
| Share observations with the larger group. | Optionally, revert to the larger group and share your observations if you feel the learnings from one group might be useful to other groups. If you do, it might be helpful to assign a note-taker, spokesperson, or timekeeper to help keep the group on track. |
| Allot time.                                | Allow group members time to process the discussions.        |
| Rephrase ideas.                            | If no one is responding to a particular prompt, try rephrasing it or approaching the idea from a different angle. |
| Listen to everyone.                       | Be sure to listen to what everyone has to say. When you pose questions, try to ensure they're related to or in response to what has been said rather than continuing ahead with a predetermined sequence of questions. |
| Gauge the mood.                           | Gauge the group, the mood, and the interpersonal dynamics. This practice will become easier as you spend more time with the group. |
| Be sensitive to varying experiences.      | Some discussions might be challenging for some of your group members depending on their prior experience. Avoid asking someone who is new to the topic of discussion or lacks sufficient prior experience to be the first person to voice their opinions. |
| Give due credit.                          | When referencing something that has already been said, try to use the speaker's name to properly credit them for their ideas. |
| Set the tone.                              | The group will turn to you to set the tone and guide dynamics, particularly when a difficult moment or topic arises. |
| Share the air.                             | Give everyone an opportunity to share their thoughts. Full participation is helpful for the entire group so that they can listen and learn from everyone. |
| Be patient.                                | Not all people learn at the same rate or in the same way. Everyone is at different places in their learning. Be patient and help others move forward. Step up to the challenge when needed and step back when it's time to give others a chance to share. |
