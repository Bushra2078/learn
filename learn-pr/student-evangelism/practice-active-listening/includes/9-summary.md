In this module, you learned about active listening and its role in effective communication in computer science. You now have a better understanding about how to set ground rules for effective communication and use active listening strategies to work better as a team.

After you incorporated active listening in your interactions at the coding camp, you gained a better appreciation of other people's perspectives. Now that the camp participants are actively listening to each other, everyone is more respectful of their teammates' points of view, even when they disagree. A few people who used to dominate the classroom by speaking most of the time are now much better at sharing the air. Having been given space to contribute by their peers, the people who were feeling left out seem happier and participate more during class discussions.
