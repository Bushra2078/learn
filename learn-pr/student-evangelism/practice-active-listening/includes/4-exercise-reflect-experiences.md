In this exercise, you'll reflect on some experiences. Ensure you note down the answers.

## Reflect on your own experiences

Have you had any of the following experiences when you wanted to communicate an idea to someone:

- You were interrupted while you were speaking or you werenâ€™t allowed to finish.
- Your idea was dismissed.
- You didn't get an opportunity to share at all.
- You didn't feel that the listener took you seriously.
- The listener was defensive and argued their point of view rather than trying understand yours.
- The listener was forming their own thoughts and waiting to speak versus being present and listening to what you had to say.

How did you feel? Did you feel understood? Did the experience discourage you from trying to share again? Take a few minutes to note your answers to these questions.
