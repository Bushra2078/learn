  questions:
  - content: "You have been asked to decide which network you want to deploy for your application. Which of the following considerations are valid:"
    choices:
    - content: "You choose 5G because you need ultra low latency."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "5G along with Azure Private MEC provides low latency for applications."
    - content: "You choose Wi-Fi because you need low latency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wi-Fi doesn't provide low latency."
    - content: "You choose 5G because 5G can be used in all cases."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even when 5G is fully deployed, multiple network types are expected to co-exist."
  - content: "Your enterprise has decided to adopt 5G technology for IoT. What are the advantages of using Azure private MEC for 5G?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure private MEC can be used for voice and data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure private MEC can't be used directly for voice services."
    - content: "Azure private MEC can be used for complex applications like self-driving cars."
