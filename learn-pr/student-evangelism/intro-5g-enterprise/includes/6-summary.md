In this module, our goal was to help you understand 5G technology and its implementation within the Azure ecosystem. You explored the 3D warehousing scenario, which needs low latency and high-density sensor applications. You understood the features of 5G and the role of Azure private MEC. You analyzed how these features combine to solve complex problems such as 3D warehousing. Azure private MEC makes it easier to deploy 5G technology to enterprise applications using a development framework that is familiar to Azure developers.  The successful deployment of 5G in the enterprise using Azure private MEC helps bring business benefits based on low latency, high throughput, and high sensor density.
