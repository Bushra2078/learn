In order to properly understand JavaScript (the language that provides interactivity on the web), we need to first understand the language's various data types and variables and how to create them and most importantly ehat to use these constructs for.  

## Interactivity

By using variables you will be able to track state, to for example remember how a user's selection or to save a calculation. Data types on the other hand allows you to store data that comes in different shapes and sizes, like numbers, strings or even more complex structures. An interactive page means a user is able to do things with a web page like selecting a button or entering information in a text field. 

If you've ever learned a programming language before, you may notice some similarities between other languages and JavaScript (however, the syntax may slightly vary). If this is your first time learning a programming language, don't worry- this module will break down all the concepts of JavaScript basics you'll need to help you be successful as a web developer.
