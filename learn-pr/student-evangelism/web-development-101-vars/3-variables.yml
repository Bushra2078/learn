  questions:
    - content: In JavaScript, we can declare values with the keywords _______ or _______
      choices:
        - content: let or var
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! These are the keywords we need to create and declare
            variables.
        - content: get or script
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- these keywords would not allow you to create a variable.
        - content: char or log
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- these keywords would not allow you to create a variable.
    - content: Constants are the same as let and var to declare variables except
      choices:
        - content: Constants can be altered
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- the reference of a constant cannot be changed once
            initialized, or an error will occur when running code.
        - content: Constants must be initialized
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct- constants must be initialized, or an error will occur when
            running code.
        - content: Constants can be reassigned
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- a constant means the reference is protected from
            reassignment. The value is not immutable though and can change,
            especially if it's a complex construct like an object.
