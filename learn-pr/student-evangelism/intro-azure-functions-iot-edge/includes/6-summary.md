In the scenario, our production supervisor needed to detect appliances with manufacturing defects visually. The business scenario had changed. Production needed to be ramped up significantly, and existing (manual) methods would no longer work. Further, the company wanted to deploy the solution rapidly. The company needed to scale the solution up (or down). Finally, the technology team was well versed in development but not in operations. 

To solve this business problem, Azure functions was used for deploying cognitive services on IoT devices. Azure functions allowed the company to scale the solution up or down without deploying infrastructure in advance. Because IoT solutions are event-based, the functionality provided by Triggers and Bindings enabled the company to develop IoT solutions rapidly.  

Without the ability to deploy Azure functions on Edge devices, the company would need to plan the infrastructure in advance. They would need to invest in expensive resources for deployment of solutions - which was avoided.

Thus, the availability of Azure functions on IoT devices helped the company to save costs, scale solutions and deploy solutions rapidly.
