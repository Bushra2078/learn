  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is a neural network?"
    choices:
    - content: "A neural network is a computer system that's modeled on the human brain and nervous system."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This is the definition of a neural network."
    - content: "A neural network means giving a computer a brain of its own."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A neural network is just modeled on a brain; it's not an actual brain."
    - content: "A neural network is software that we install on a computer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A neural network isn't software."      
  - content: "What does accuracy in an AI model mean?"
    choices:
    - content: "The percentage of time the model made an incorrect prediction."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer doesn't refer to measuring accuracy."
    - content: "The percentage of time the model made a correct prediction."
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "Correct! Accuracy in this context means how often the model was correct."
    - content: "The number of images you need to train the model for the model's accuracy to be perfect."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The accuracy rate of an AI model doesn't include the details of the testing itself."
    - content: "The percentage of time the AI model will work."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The AI model should work every time you run it."
  - content: "How can you increase the accuracy of an AI model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Train the model three times instead of five times."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Training the model more times won't necessarily increase the accuracy of the model."
    - content: "Decrease the number of epochs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Decreasing the number of epochs during training won't necessarily increase the accuracy of the model."
    - content: "Add more images and increase the epoch number."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can increase the accuracy of an AI model by adding more images and epochs when you train the model."
    - content: "Decrease the number of images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Changing only the number of images during training won't necessarily increase the accuracy of the model."
