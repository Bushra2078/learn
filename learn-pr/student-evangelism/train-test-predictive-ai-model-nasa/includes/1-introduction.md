At this point, you have your data imported, cleaned, and ready for training and testing. Now you can create and train an artificial intelligence (AI) model by using the data.

The libraries you imported will do most of the heavy work for you. Your job is to tell the computer how to train the model so it can make predictions.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll create an AI model with a neural network. The model will identify the type of space rock in an image. We'll use Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebook to build, train, and test the model.
