Now that you have all of your data imported and modified to your liking, you can begin to create and train an artificial intelligence (AI) model. The libraries you imported will do a lot of the heavy work for you, but you still have to tell the computer how to train your model so that it can make predictions.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebook to create an AI model that can identify the type of a rock in an image.
