Now that you have all of your data imported and modified to your liking, you can begin to create and train an artificial intelligence (AI) model. The libraries you imported will do a lot of the heavy work for you, but you still have to tell the computer how to train your model so that it can make predictions.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebook to create an AI model that can identify the type of a rock in an image.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn what neural networks are
- Train an AI model
- Test the model by having it classify various space rocks

## Prerequisites

- Ability to write and run introductory Python programs
- Visual Studio Code, a Python extension, and Jupyter Notebook installed
- AI libraries installed
