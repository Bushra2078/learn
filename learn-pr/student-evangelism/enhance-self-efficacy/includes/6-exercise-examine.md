## Reflection

Review the following prompts and for each one, decide whether it’s in your comfort zone, outside your comfort zone, or if you feel neutral about it:

- Onboarding to a new team or supervisor

- Pitching an idea to a group

- Trying something new for the first time

- Taking a class where all your classmates seem to have been born with CS knowledge

- Creating a website

- Answering a question in class

- Introducing yourself to a new group

- Pitching your idea at a hackathon

Spend a few minutes thinking about your answers to the following questions:

- What was interesting or surprising to you about the prompts?

- Did you find yourself thinking, “This is so me!” or “That’s right up my alley!”

- Were there some situations where you thought, “I can’t do that” or “That’s not me”?
