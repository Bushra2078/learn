In this exercise, you'll reflect on your self-efficacy in several situations.

Review the following questions. Spend a few minutes thinking about your responses, and note your answers on a device or paper.

- Make one list of academic subjects or skills where you consider yourself strong and capable. Make a second list of subjects or skills that you feel aren't your strengths. Does anything stand out to you about your lists? Did you learn anything new or surprising about your self-efficacy?
- What are some areas in which you have low self-efficacy? How do you plan to improve on those areas?
- When you interact with people, try to notice signs of low self-efficacy in them. How will you help them improve their self-efficacy in those areas?
- Self-efficacy can be affected by comparing yourself to other people. Do you make fair social comparisons between yourself and the people you interact with in a technology workspace?
- Feedback can help you grow your confidence to achieve certain tasks. Can you unpack feedback constructively?
- You can increase self-efficacy by noticing small successes. Do you notice your small successes and spend time building on them and visualizing further progress?
