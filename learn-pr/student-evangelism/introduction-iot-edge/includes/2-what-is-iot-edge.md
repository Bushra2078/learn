Azure IoT Edge is a managed service built on Azure IoT Hub. IoT Edge allows you to deploy your cloud workloads to run on IoT devices via standard containers. These workloads could include artificial intelligence applications, Azure and third-party services, or your own business logic.

IoT Edge enables you to:

**React in near real time to local changes:** Because some functionality is implemented at the edge, the device spends less time communicating with the cloud. Hence,  the device can react quickly to local changes by processing the data on the device. Also, when modules run locally, they can avail of the option to use specialized hardware such as a field-programmable gate array via Project brainwave.

**Manage devices on the edge:** IoT Edge provides a cloud interface and a runtime module, which enables you to remotely manage and deploy workloads to edge devices through the IoT hub.

**Deploy using Containers:** IoT Edge allows you to use Docker-compatible containers to run your business logic at the edge
Deploy using secure and certified hardware: IoT Edge enables access to certified IoT Edge hardware on Linux or Windows devices that support container engines

**Offload AI and analytics workloads to the edge:** IoT Edge allows you to deploy models built and trained in the cloud and run them on edge devices. IoT Edge uses the model to process data locally and respond to the event rapidly. 

**Use existing developer skillsets and code:** IoT Edge code supports languages such as C, C#, Java, Node.js, and Python.
Manage data to reduce costs: IoT Edge devices capture a large amount of data, but only a small portion of that data is needed for further analysis. If all the data is sent to the cloud, the user will incur transportation and storage costs. IoT Edge reduces costs by allowing you to only send a segment of the data as needed. You could also send aggregated data to the cloud. Sending aggregated data to the cloud reduces overall costs of managing data but does not compromise on the functionality.

**Reliable operation in offline or intermittent mode:** Often, IoT devices need to operate in intermittent or offline connectivity to the cloud. IoT Edge device management functionality automatically synchronizes the latest state of your devices once theyâ€™ve reconnected to the cloud to ensure seamless operations.

**Security for edge deployments:**  IoT Edge provides security in several ways. IoT Edge ensures that only the right devices can communicate with each other and that they have the right software installed. IoT Edge can provide added security by integrating with Azure Security Center. Also, by IoT Edge can make  use of any   hardware security modules if available to provide strong authenticated connections for confidential computing.
