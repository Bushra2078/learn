Consider the example of the doctor who uses an IoT device to monitor glucose levels needing an immediate response. An algorithm is run on the device, which creates the alert. The device runs even when connectivity is poor. In this situation, IoT Edge can help solve the doctor’s problem. IoT Edge can provide the ability to run modules (algorithms) securely on edge devices even under intermittent connectivity. In the absence of the IoT Edge, the developer would have to create all the functionality themselves (example: security, deploying machine learning on edge devices, offline operation, so on.). By using IoT Edge, you can focus on the business problem at hand (providing care to the patient and responding to emergency scenarios).

The doctor serving multiple patients have to manage constantly a set of conflicting priorities. Hence, a system that manages responses from patients operates under a set of performance criteria in terms of managing patient responses. The system has to consider limitations of  components (cloud response times) and overcome them by other methods (edge computing). You also have to include design considerations and physical constraints of technology (low or absence of connectivity) along with management of data securely on devices
