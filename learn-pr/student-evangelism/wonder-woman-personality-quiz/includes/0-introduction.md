Have you ever taken a personality quiz? Where you answer a series of multiple-choice questions and find out things like... "What type of emoji are you?"

You probably knew, but the ones that are  out on the Internet are just a series of questions that have scores associated with each answer choice, and then a range of scores for each "personality". Seriously!

For example, there might be 3 questions with 2 answer choices each:  
What's your favorite color?

- red (10 pts)
- green (4 pt)

What's your favorite food?

- chips (6 pts)
- ice cream (5 pt)

So there would be  possible outcomes:

- red-chips - 16 pts
- red-ice cream - 15 pts
- green-chips - 10 pts
- green-ice cream - 9 pts

And maybe you have 3 personalities:

- Under 10 pts: You are personable and clever
- 10-14 pts: You are passionate and intense
- 15+ pts: You are compassionate and opinionated

You can see that it really doesn't matter what kind of food the quiz-taker chooses if they choose the color red, because that will automatically put them in the "compassionate and opinionated" category. 

With [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/?azure-portal=true) and the power of Python and inspired by the [WONDER WOMAN 1984](https://www.wonderwomanfilm.com/?azure-portal=true) film, you're going to get a chance to make your own "Which WONDER WOMAN 1984 Character are you most like?" quiz.
