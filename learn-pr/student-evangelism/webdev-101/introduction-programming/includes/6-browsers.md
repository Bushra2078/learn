Running your programs on the Internet requires some sort of client. A common form of client is web browser, with which you can interact with the content. 

## Browser for the developer

Web developers rely on the browser to observe how their code runs on the web, it's also used to view visual elements of a web page that are written in the editor, like HTML.

### Developer tools 

Many browsers come with developer tools (DevTools) that contain a set of helpful features and information to assist developers to collect and capture important insights about their application. For example: If a web page has errors, it's sometimes helpful to know when they occurred. DevTools in a browser can be configured to capture this information.
