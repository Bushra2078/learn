A single instruction in a program is called a statement and will usually have a character or line spacing that marks where the instruction ends, or terminates. How a program terminates varies with each language.

Most programs rely on using data from a user or elsewhere, where statements may rely on data to carry out instructions. Data can change how a program behaves, so programming languages come with a way to temporarily store data that can be used later. This data is called variables. Variables are statements that instruct a device to save data in its memory. Variables in programs are similar to ones in algebra, where they have a unique name and their value may change over time.

There's a chance that some statements will not be executed by a device. This is usually by design when written by the developer or by accident when an unexpected error occurs. This type of control of an application makes it more robust and maintainable. Typically these changes in control happen when certain decisions are met. A common statement in modern programming languages to control how a program is run is the `if...else` statement.
