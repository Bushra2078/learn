Programming (also known as coding) is the process of writing instructions to a device, such as a computer or mobile device. We write these instructions with a programming language, which is then interpreted by the device. These sets of instructions may be referred to by various names, but program, computer program, application (app), and executable are a few popular names.

A program can be anything that is written with code; websites, games, and phone apps are programs. While it's possible to create a program without writing code, the underlying logic is interpreted to the device and that logic was most likely written with code. A program that is running or executing code is carrying out instructions. The device that you're currently reading this lesson with is running a program to print it to your screen.
