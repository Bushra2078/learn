Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a specific subtopic of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is defined as the ability to *transform* a linguistic statement to a representation that enables you to understand your users naturally. Natural language understanding remains a very challenging problem and is defined as an *AI-hard* problem.

On Microsoft Azure, language understanding is supported through the Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), more commonly known as Language Understanding. LUIS is a cloud-based conversational AI service that applies custom machine learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information, thus providing natural language understanding to your data. LUIS offloads you from the need of in-house AI expertise or any prior machine learning knowledge. With only a few clicks you can build your own conversational AI application.

Knowledge of basic concepts related to LUIS and NLU along with additional terminology is essential in creating your own Azure Health Bot.
