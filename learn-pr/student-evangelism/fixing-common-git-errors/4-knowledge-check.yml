    - content: "Making experimental changes to your project in an isolated branch."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Using branches to create different sets of changes to a project is a key use case for version control."
    - content: "Gathering feature requirements for a large project and communicating them to stakeholders."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although some teams use tools like GitHub to collaborate, version control systems are not designed for this type of work."

    choices:
    - content: "When should you avoid changing a past commit?"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Git is the tool you can use to work with a local branch and push changes to a remote repository. GitHub acts as the remote repository."
    - content: "Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that runs in the cloud. GitHub is an interface layer that provides access to Git technology."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Users have access to both Git and GitHub. GitHub is a cloud platform that uses the Git DVCS."
    - content: "Git is used by an individual contributor. GitHub is used by multiple contributors to simplify group development work."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Both Git and GitHub are used by individual contributors and by teams to facilitate working together."
