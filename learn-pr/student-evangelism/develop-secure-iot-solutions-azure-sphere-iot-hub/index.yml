title: "Develop secure IoT Solutions for Azure Sphere with IoT Hub"
summary: "Deploy an Azure Sphere application to monitor ambient conditions for laboratory conditions. The application will monitor the room environment conditions, connect to IoT Central, and send telemetry data from the device to the cloud. You'll control cloud to device communications and undertake actions as needed."
