You ran applications on the Azure Sphere to send environment data to IoT Hub. You monitored the data with Azure IoT Explorer. You were able to control the device using device twins and direct methods.

We learnt that Azure Sphere is secure by default, with ongoing updates, and multiple layers of security. Azure Sphere protects our IoT devices, our networks, and our solutions, and it also helps to protect against software bugs and mistakes we make in our applications.

We also learnt that Azure Sphere is flexible and supports a wide range of application scenarios. Azure Sphere has three developer-accessible cores you can deploy your applications on. You can run less demanding high-level applications and simultaneously run   demanding, time sensitive real-time applications on the real-time Cortex-M4 cores.

IoT security was critical for this microbiology lab, without this Azure Sphere-based application, you would need to manually record room conditions at regular intervals. Any variation in the lab environment can't be detected in real time. Using this solution, you'll have the ability to produce accurate, stable, and secure results in near real time.
