## Step 1: Open the project

1. Start Visual Studio Code to open your project.

2. Click **Open folder**.

3. Open the **Azure-Sphere lab** folder.

4. Open the **Lab_3_Device_Twins** folder.

5. Click **Select Folder** or the **OK** button to open the project.

## Step 2: Set your developer board configuration

These labs support developer boards from Avnet and Seeed Studio. Set the configuration that matches your developer board.

The default developer board configuration is for the Avnet Azure Sphere Starter Kit Revision 1. If you have this board, there's no additional configuration required.

1. Open the **CMakeList.txt** file.

2. Add a `#` at the beginning of the set Avnet line to disable it.

3. Uncomment the `set` command that corresponds to your Azure Sphere device developer board.

   ```text
   set(AVNET TRUE "AVNET Azure Sphere Starter Kit Revision 1 ")
   # set(AVNET_REV_2 TRUE "AVNET Azure Sphere Starter Kit Revision 2 ")
   # set(SEEED_STUDIO_RDB TRUE "Seeed Studio Azure Sphere MT3620 Development Kit (aka Reference Design Board or rdb)")
   # set(SEEED_STUDIO_MINI TRUE "Seeed Studio Azure Sphere MT3620 Mini Dev Board")
   ```

4. Save the file. The CMake cache with be autogenerated.

## Step 3: Configure the Azure IoT connection information

1. Open the **app_manifest.json** file.

2. You'll need to redo the settings for the **app_manifest.json** file. Either copy the settings from Notepad if you still have it open, or copy them from the **app_manifest.json** file you created in the previous exercise.

3. Replace the existing configuration by pasting the contents of the clipboard into **app_manifest.json**.

4. Save the updated **app_manifest.json** file.

## Step 4: Start the app build deploy process

1. Open **main.c**.

1. Select **CMake: [Debug]: Ready** from the Visual Studio Code Status Bar.

1. From Visual Studio Code, press F5 to build, deploy, start, and attach the remote debugger to the application.

## Step 5: Set the desired temperature

1. Start **Azure IoT Explorer**.

1. Click **View devices in this hub**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/iot-explorer-view-devices-in-this-hub.png" alt-text="The illustration shows how to set the desired temperature.":::

1. Click your on your **device**.

    The device name is your Azure Sphere Device ID. You can display your Device ID by running the following command from the Windows **PowerShell command line** or Linux **Terminal**.

    ```
    azsphere device show-attached
    ```

1. Click **IoT Plug and Play components** from the side menu.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/iot-explorer-iot-pnp.png" alt-text="The illustration shows how to select IoT Plug and Play components.":::

1. Click **Default component**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/iot-explorer-pnp-default-component.png" alt-text="The illustration shows how to select the default component.":::

1. Select **Properties (writable)** from the menu.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/iot-explorer-pnp-properties-writable.png" alt-text="The illustration shows set a property.":::

1. Set the **Desired Temperature** property.

1. Click the **Update desired value** button.

1. Click **Refresh** to display the latest reported values.

    The device will acknowledge the property update by setting the reported value, along with an acknowledgment code and version. This behavior is defined as part of the [IoT Plug and Play conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-pnp/concepts-convention?azure-portal=true).

## Step 6: Expected device behavior

The Avnet Azure Sphere Starter Kit, revisions 1 and 2, have a built-in temperature sensor. For other boards, a random temperature of 25 +/- 5 degrees Celsius is generated.

### Azure Sphere MT3620 Starter Kit Revision 1 and 2

![The illustration shows the Avnet Azure Sphere kit.](../media/avnet-azure-sphere.jpg)

1. The WLAN LED will blink every 5 seconds when connected to Azure.

1. The RGB LED will turn red if the measured temperature is less than the desired temperature, blue if the measured temperature is greater than the desired temperature and green if the measured temperature is the same as the desired temperature.

### Seeed Studio Azure Sphere MT3620 Development Kit

![The illustration shows the Seeed Studio Azure Sphere kit.](../media/seeed-studio-azure-sphere-rdb.jpg)

1. The WLAN LED will blink every 5 seconds when connected to Azure.

1. The RGB LED will turn red if the measured temperature is less than the desired temperature, blue if the measured temperature is greater than the desired temperature and green if the measured temperature is the same as the desired temperature.

### Seeed Studio MT3620 Mini Dev Board

![The illustration shows the Seeed Studio Mini Azure Sphere kit.](../media/seeed-studio-azure-sphere-mini.png)

1. The User LED will blink every 5 seconds when connected to Azure.
