In this unit, you will learn how to remote restart an Azure Sphere from Azure IoT Explorer.

## Understanding IoT Hub direct method commands

Azure IoT Hub uses direct method commands to invoke an action on a device. Commands are often used for interactive control of devices, such as turning on a fan, a light, or in the case of this unit, to restart the Azure Sphere.

IoT Hub direct methods represent a request-reply interaction with a device similar to an HTTP call in that they succeed or fail immediately (after a user-specified timeout). This approach is useful for scenarios where the course of immediate action is different depending on whether the device was able to respond.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a number of reasons why you might need to remote restart a Azure Sphere. Device certificates, OS updates, and application updates are done on a 24 hour cycle or after the device has been restarted. You may have an operational reason why you need to restart the device to force an update.

## Remote restarting an Azure Sphere

From the IoT Explorer you can invoke a direct method command to restart the device. You need to set the number of seconds the device will wait before restarting. Azure IoT Hub sends a direct method message with an optional payload to the device. The device responds with a status code and optionally a message indicating if the command succeeded or failed.

### Steps to restarting an Azure Sphere IoT Explorer

The following steps outline how Azure IoT Explorer and Azure IoT Hub direct methods are used for cloud-to-device control.

1. From Azure IoT Explorer you can invoke the **Restart Device** IoT Hub direct method command.
1. Azure IoT Hub then sends the direct method command message to the device.
1. On the Azure Sphere, the **RestartDeviceHandler** function is called.
1. Next the device sends a device twin **ReportedRestartUTC** message to Azure IoT to record the time the device was restarted.
1. The direct method responds with an HTTP status code and a response message.
1. The Azure Sphere is then restarted.
1. Azure IoT Explorer queries and displays the device **ReportedRestartUTC** property.

## Getting started with direct method bindings

A direct method binding maps an IoT Hub direct method command name with a handler function that will be called to implement the action.

The following example declares a Direct Method Binding to restart the Azure Sphere. This declaration maps the Azure IoT Hub `RestartDevice` direct method command with a handler function named `RestartDeviceHandler`.

```c
static LP_DIRECT_METHOD_BINDING dm_restartDevice = {
    .methodName = "RestartDevice",
    .handler = RestartDeviceHandler };
```

### Remote restarting the Azure Sphere

The following is the implementation of the handler function `RestartDeviceHandler`. The handler function is called when the device receives a direct method message named `RestartDevice` from Azure IoT Hub.

```c
/// <summary>
/// Start Device Power Restart Direct Method 'ResetMethod' integer seconds eg 5
/// </summary>
static LP_DIRECT_METHOD_RESPONSE_CODE RestartDeviceHandler(JSON_Value* json, LP_DIRECT_METHOD_BINDING* directMethodBinding, char** responseMsg)
{
    const size_t responseLen = 60; // Allocate and initialize a response message buffer. The calling function is responsible for the freeing memory
    static struct timespec period;

    *responseMsg = (char*)malloc(responseLen);
    memset(*responseMsg, 0, responseLen);

    if (json_value_get_type(json) != JSONNumber) { return LP_METHOD_FAILED; }

    int seconds = (int)json_value_get_number(json);

    // leave enough time for the device twin dt_reportedRestartUtc to update before restarting the device
    if (seconds > 2 && seconds < 10)
    {
        // Report Device Restart UTC
        lp_deviceTwinReportState(&dt_reportedRestartUtc, lp_getCurrentUtc(msgBuffer, sizeof(msgBuffer))); // LP_TYPE_STRING

        // Create Direct Method Response
        snprintf(*responseMsg, responseLen, "%s called. Restart in %d seconds", directMethodBinding->methodName, seconds);

        // Set One Shot LP_TIMER
        period = (struct timespec){ .tv_sec = seconds, .tv_nsec = 0 };
        lp_timerOneShotSet(&restartDeviceOneShotTimer, &period);

        return LP_METHOD_SUCCEEDED;
    }
    else
    {
        snprintf(*responseMsg, responseLen, "%s called. Restart Failed. Seconds out of range: %d", directMethodBinding->methodName, seconds);
        return LP_METHOD_FAILED;
    }
}
```

## Azure Sphere PowerControls Capability

The RestartDeviceHandler function sets up a one-shot timer that invokes the **DelayRestartDeviceTimerHandler** function after the specified restart period measured in seconds. In the DelayRestartDeviceTimerHandler function a call is made to the **PowerManagement_ForceSystemReboot** API. The PowerManagement_ForceSystemReboot API requires the **PowerControls** capability to be declared in the app_manifest.json file.

```json
"PowerControls": [
    "ForceReboot"
]
```

## How direct methods are mapped to handlers

All declared direct method bindings must be added by reference to the directMethodBindingSet array. When a direct method message is received by the device from Azure IoT Hub, it is checked for a matching *methodName* name in the directMethodBindingSet array. When a match is found, the corresponding handler function is called.

```c
LP_DIRECT_METHOD_BINDING* directMethodBindingSet[] = { &dm_restartDevice };
```

### Opening the direct method binding set

The direct method binding set is initialized in the **InitPeripheralsAndHandlers** function in **main.c**.

```c
lp_directMethodSetOpen(directMethodBindingSet, NELEMS(directMethodBindingSet));
```

### Closing the direct method binding set

The direct method bindings set is closed in the **ClosePeripheralsAndHandlers** function in **main.c**.

```c
lp_directMethodSetClose();
```
