In this module, you explored how to create functions in JavaScript. Functions is a great abstraction to use when we need to carry out the same task multiple times and want to abstain from duplicating code. Moreover, you learned the difference between a function and a method. These two types are both functions but a function is free floating and a method sits on an object.

Then you went on to learn about parameters, variables part of the function signature. Parameters can be used to pass data to the function that it can operate on. 

After that the topic of return variables was covered. Return values are data leaving the function. Any invoker of a function can leverage the return value by assigning it to a variable.

Finally you learned about anonymous functions. Anonymous function doesn't have a name but are functions that can be passed. It's commonly used in a context where a task needs to be performed that is asynchronous and will finish sometime in the future, for example a timeout our fetching data across the network. Once said task finish the anonymous function is invoked.
