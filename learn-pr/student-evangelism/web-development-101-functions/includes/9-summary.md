In this module, you explored how to create functions in JavaScript. A function is a great abstraction to use when you need to carry out the same task multiple times and want to avoid duplicating your code. You also learned the difference between a function and a method. These two types are both functions, but a function is free floating and a method sits on an object.

You then went on to learn about parameters and variables as part of the function signature. You use parameters to pass data to the function to operate on. 

Next, you learned about return variables. A return value is data leaving the function. Any invoker of a function can leverage the return value by assigning it to a variable.

Finally, you learned about anonymous functions. An anonymous function doesn't have a name, but it's a function that can be passed. It's commonly used in a context where a task needs to be performed that is asynchronous and will finish sometime in the future. Examples might be a timeout or fetching data across the network. After the task finishes, the anonymous function is invoked.
