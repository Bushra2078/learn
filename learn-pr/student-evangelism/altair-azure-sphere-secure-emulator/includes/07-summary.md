In this module, you learned that Azure Sphere is secure by design and default. You must declare all network endpoints for Azure IoT Central and the test.mosquitto.org MQTT broker. Not doing so will mean the Altair emulator can't connect to these cloud services. 

We also learned the Altair emulator on Azure Sphere uses certificates to sign and secure communications with two cloud services, IoT Central and the MQTT broker.
