This unit summaries the main steps completed in this module.

In this module, you learned:

* Azure Sphere is secure by design and default. 
* You must declare all network endpoints for Azure IoT Central and the test.mosquitto.org MQTT broker. 
* Failing to declare network endpoints will mean the Altair emulator can't connect to the required cloud services. 

We also learned the Altair emulator on Azure Sphere uses certificates to sign and secure communications with two cloud services, IoT Central and the MQTT broker.
