Welcome to the cloud-connected Altair 8800 on Azure Sphere learning path. In this module, you'll learn how to secure the Altair emulator running on Azure Sphere.

## Scenario: IoT Security

The traditional approach to IoT development is that you're responsible for integrating and maintaining all the parts of a solution. As an IoT developer, you are responsible for security, authentication, certificates, identity, encryption libraries, update processes, your solution, and more. Not only are you a solution expert, but you're responsible for tracking new and emerging security threats, mitigating, and updating to protect IoT devices.

Azure Sphere is a highly secure IoT platform. Azure Sphere manages identity, certificates, reporting, operating system and application updates. Because Azure Sphere manages security on your behalf, you can focus on the IoT solutions you are building.

## What will you learn?

Azure Sphere is secure by design and applications running on Azure Sphere are secure by default. You grant capabilities to the application. Granting capabilities is key to Azure Sphere security and is also known as the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege?azure-portal=true). You grant only the capabilities that the Azure Sphere application needs to run correctly, and no more.

In this module, you'll learn how to declare the network endpoints capabilities for Azure IoT Central and an MQTT broker. The Altair emulator can only connect to declared network endpoints.

## What is the main goal?

The module will focus on understanding how to declare the network endpoints the Altair emulator will be using.
