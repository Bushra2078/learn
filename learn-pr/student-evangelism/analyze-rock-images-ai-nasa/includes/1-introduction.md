Now that you've some background information about what artificial intelligence (AI), what it is, and how you use it, you can start creating your own program that uses AI. Installing Python AI libraries is a great first step in creating a rock classification program. The libraries give you a base model that you can train to complete the task at hand.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebook to add and clean up images of rocks that we'll use to create and train an AI model.
