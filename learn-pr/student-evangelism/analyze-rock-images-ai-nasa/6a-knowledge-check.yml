quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of separating data into training and testing groups?"
    choices:
    - content: "To train the model with one portion of the data and test the model with the rest of the data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! We separate data into training and testing groups so that we can split the data between the two groups."
    - content: "Data is separated into training and testing groups because the computer can't test that much data at once."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The amount of data a computer can test isn't a factor in why we separate data into training and testing groups."
    - content: "To train the model more quickly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The speed with which a computer can train the model isn't the reason we separate data into training and testing groups."
  - content: "How do computers view images?"
    choices:
    - content: "By capturing and processing photo captions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using only captions would exclude a substantial amount of information about photos."
    - content: "By separating the photo into four sections and then reading them one section at a time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Computers don't read images by separating into sections."
    - content: "By breaking down the photo into ones and zeros."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Computers can read image data only by breaking down the photo into ones and zero."
  - content: "How did we clean the data in our AI model?"
    choices:
    - content: "By deleting images that were blurry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We didn't delete any images."
    - content: "By resizing all the images, so they were the same size."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! We cleaned the data by resizing all the images, so they were the same size."
    - content: "By editing some photos by using Microsoft Paint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We didn't edit photos to clean our data."
