The bot is an application that your end users interact with. The Health Bot Service offers to the users personalized access to health-related information and interactions through a natural conversation experience. It supports several built-in scenarios, while partners have the ability to extend the functionality of the bot by authoring custom scenarios.

## What is a scenario?

Scenarios are conversational flows that are programmed into the bot. Typically, when a scenario is triggered by the health bot, the user completes a series of questions and answers until the scenario is complete. There are two types of scenarios: built-in and custom scenarios. Built-in scenarios enable important functionality, like showing a help menu or presenting the terms of service to your end users and perform tasks such as triaging, checking symptoms or answering questions about medical conditions and types of drugs. Custom scenarios extend the functionality of the Health Bot service and can integrate with external data sources to create engaging experiences for your end users.

## What is a Scenario Template?

Scenario templates are pre-built custom scenarios that provide examples for popular healthcare use cases and enable you to quickly build out your own custom scenarios. When you import a template into your Health Bot instance it will automatically create the assets required for that scenario, such as languages models, localized strings, data connections and resources. After import you will have access to all the scenario's elements, you can easily customize and extend any part of the scenario and import multiple templates to enrich the capabilities of your bot. Templates also help you learn how to build Health Bot scenarios as you can easily go through the scenario logic to understand how it was built.

All scenario templates can be accessed via the Template Catalog. In the Scenario Template Catalog, you will be able to see a preview and description of the available scenario templates.
