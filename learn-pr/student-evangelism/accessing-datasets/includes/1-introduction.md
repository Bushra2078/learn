Machine Learning is all about uncovering hidden patterns and insights in a specific set of data. To get started, you'll need to access that dataset, and bring it into your development environment, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). In this module, we'll cover three popular methods for retrieving datasets - downloading a .csv file from GitHub, using an Azure SQL Database, and grabbing a .JSON file from Azure Blob Storage.

If you haven't already set up your development environment, [install the coding tools for Python development](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/install-code-tools-python-nasa/). We'll also use the [Azure Databases for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-cosmosdb) and [Azure Storage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage) extensions, so go ahead and download those, too.
