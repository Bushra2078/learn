As you begin working with your teammates, you realize that they're adept at programming and shouldn't find the project overwhelming. Yet, they're stressed and struggling with motivation. You decide to outline the importance of emotions on how team members interact with each other and succeed in their goals. In this unit, you'll learn about EQ and why it's a critical component of success in a technology environment.

## Problem solving in a tech workspace

The technology industry is a dynamic place. You get to work on tools, apps, and programs that make it possible to work from anywhere, improve the way teams collaborate, and refine the developer experience. As a person at the forefront of this excitement, you'll also encounter challenges. Technology is always evolving and changing. As you keep pace with these changes, you'll face hurdles, bugs, and frustration.

Have you ever faced a challenge and felt like you didn't know where to start? When you work in computer science, you need to have strategic problem-solving abilities so that you can plan, iteratively test, evaluate, and refine your work. These skills are necessary for all your projects, whether you're working on them individually or with a team.

### Examine the importance of emotions

How you approach a problem can be as important as the final solution to that problem. To strategically plan and work your way through challenges in computer science, you need to know how to work with your emotions. It's important to be aware of your emotional state and be able to regulate your emotional reactions.

It's common to spend inordinate amounts of time writing code, finding bugs and fixing them, and maintaining apps and programs as they change. But few people spend a comparable amount of time on their emotions. Your emotions play a fundamental role in how you manage your work, interact with your teammates, and work your way through challenges. To succeed in a healthy workplace, you need to make space to recognize and strategize around the role your emotions play. Technical knowledge is essential, but it isn't enough to succeed and build strong teams in a technology workspace.

## Define EQ

Have you ever been stuck trying to fix a bug when there's a looming deadline, and despite feeling frustrated, anxious, or panicked, you thought, "What can I do to get through this?" If you have, then you demonstrated signs of EQ, which is defined as the ability to identify, name, and manage your emotions. The better this ability, the higher your EQ level. EQ is a crucial aspect of healthy interactions with your peers and supervisors. By exercising your EQ, you can improve your connections with others and help them during difficult times.

In computer science, challenges and deadlines are commonplace. Faced with these situations, a person with high EQ first recognizes their frustration, anxiety, or panic. They can then find a way to calm down and move forward by creating a plan and moving toward a solution.

Conversely, a person with low EQ might not recognize or manage their emotions. They might lose motivation and avoid the task, or take our emotions on themselves or others.

When it comes to the topic of EQ, most people have different opinions and comfort levels. As you learn more about EQ and how to incorporate it into your self-talk and your interactions with others, you'll find it easier to integrate it into your daily approach.

> EQ isn't typically taught in computer science curricula, even though it's a crucial skill for technology workers and students.

## Identify the characteristics of EQ

According to research, people with high EQ display the following characteristics:

- **Self-awareness.** Self-awareness is your awareness of yourself. When you're self-aware, you have a clear understanding of your emotions, drives, values, goals, strengths, and weaknesses. You can expand your self-awareness to awareness of others and their emotions, fears, and anxiety. The more self-aware you are, the better you can actively listen to others, try different perspectives, and connect with your teammates.

- **Self-regulation.** Self-regulation is your ability to control or redirect disruptive emotions and impulses. It's an essential skill in managing challenging situations such as deadlines and problems during code development or testing.
- **Motivation.** Motivation is your willingness to do something to achieve your final goal. When you're motivated, you're driven to achieve for the sake of achievement and are passionate about your work. Motivation helps you persevere through challenges.
- **Empathy.** Empathy is the ability to consider other people's feelings, especially when you're making decisions. When you're empathetic toward someone, you understand their feelings and problems from their perspective. Empathy is a key tool in building and managing teams.
- **Social skills.** Your social skills define how well you communicate with others in your work and personal environments. You communicate with people in many different ways, such as speaking, gesturing, using your body language, and writing. When you're socially skilled, you can create a positive and inclusive environment at work and school. You can also better manage tensions between your teammates and resolve conflicts as they arise.
