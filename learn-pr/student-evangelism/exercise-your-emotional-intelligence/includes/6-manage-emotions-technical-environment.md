You’ve been working with the team to identify and name emotions. Many of your teammates acknowledge that they’re anxious about the demands of the project. They’re trying to avoid making mistakes, but mistakes are inevitable. They get dejected when their code doesn’t work or they’re unable to make progress. You now want to work with them on steps they can take to manage their emotions while working on the apps. You’re hopeful that this will help your team members understand each other’s struggles and work together better.

## Exercise your EQ by managing your emotions

As you learned in the previous units, it’s sometimes easy to ignore the role your emotions play in daily life. Remember that people have different levels of EQ and react differently to difficult situations. Whether you’re brainstorming with your teammates, preparing for a presentation, or writing code, your emotions can have a huge impact on your interactions with others. When you’re feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, learn to work with your emotions to achieve better results for yourself and your team.

### Notice your emotions

As you learned in the previous unit, your first step is to identify and name your emotions. Create some space for yourself to analyze the situation and your reaction to it. Remember from the video: Recognize that you’re feeling an emotion, even though you don’t know its name.

### Plan next steps

After naming and acknowledging your emotions, you can start planning next steps and strategizing possible solutions. You can outline the issues you’re facing, think about options for moving forward, and decide on the benefits and drawbacks of each option. You can then discard any ideas that might be time-consuming or complicated.

### Take the space and time you need

When a project deadline is fast approaching or you’re unable to stay ahead of the bugs you’re being assigned, it can feel like you’re running out of time. However, if you don’t take time to step back, pause, and reflect, your stress will only grow and impact your emotions negatively. Take a moment for yourself, calm down, and then approach the problem objectively.

### Record your thoughts

You can note your thoughts on a piece of paper or a device. You could also note the problems you’re dealing with and how you plan to solve them. Think of the people you can approach for help if you need it. By recording your emotions and your thought process, you can approach the situation more efficiently.

### Seek support and feedback

Many people you work with have probably experienced the same challenges as you. Your teammates, supervisors, and friends all have stories they could share with you. When you’re ready, seek out someone you trust and share your situation with them. Ask them for feedback on your proposed plan of action and if they have any tips to share.

### Practice different perspectives

When you’re struggling, remember that your teammates might be struggling as well. Cultivate an inclusive environment by using active listening to better understand their needs. This practice will build empathy towards those around you and make people feel supported.

Remember from the video: Perspective-taking not only improves your EQ but also helps you and your team move forward.

## Explore the connection between EQ and mindset

Your EQ affects your mindset, which in turn, plays an important role in how you manage stress, challenges, and unexpected setbacks. Your mindset—that is, your frame of mind—is the set of beliefs and thought processes that influence the way you approach situations. There are two types of mindsets:

- Fixed mindset. A fixed mindset is the mental attitude that our basic abilities, such as intelligence and talent, are fixed traits. When you have a fixed mindset, you’re apprehensive about starting tasks or learning new skills. You might think, “I’m not good enough” or “What will everyone think if I fail?” You might believe that you’re only capable of doing certain things and consider situations as tests that reveal the abilities you were born with.

- Growth mindset. A growth mindset is the mental attitude that you can develop your basic abilities with dedication and hard work. When you have a growth mindset, challenging situations are opportunities to learn and grow your skills. You think, “I’ll work on this issue and improve my skills” and “I can ask my team for their support and feedback.” You tell yourself that every great programmer was once a beginner and that you can learn anything you don’t know yet.

> [!NOTE]
> Research has demonstrated that having a growth mindset toward learning can improve resilience and a person’s potential for success. A passion for learning, not a hunger for approval, reflects a growth mindset. People with a growth mindset don’t think of themselves as failing, but as learning.

To learn more about mindset and how you can cultivate a growth mindset, review the following video, which is approximately three minutes in length.

### How does EQ affect your mindset?

When you have high EQ, your attitude and thought process reflect a growth mindset. You engage in positive self-talk and are more open to learning and receiving feedback from others. As you work on your emotions to increase your EQ, you’ll become more comfortable engaging in situations that make you uncomfortable or anxious, whether it be meeting a new team or promoting your apps to senior management. You’ll also notice ways to use your EQ to improve team interaction and achieve better outcomes.

When you have low EQ, your attitude and thought process reflect a fixed mindset. You remain unsure of your capabilities and lack confidence in pursuing new tasks, practicing, and persevering. The following table compares the differences in attitudes and outcomes for the two mindsets and EQ levels.

| Low EQ and a fixed mindset                                   | High EQ and a growth mindset                                 |
