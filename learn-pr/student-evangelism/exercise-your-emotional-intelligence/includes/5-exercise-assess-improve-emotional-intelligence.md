With your team leader’s support and encouragement, the team has come a long way in working with their emotions. They’re better at identifying their emotions and using strategies to manage their negative feelings. You now want to assess your EQ and identify areas of improvement for yourself and the team.

## Review the following scenario

Consider a scenario in which you're working on the final version of a finance app. One of the core requirements for this app is an understanding of the stock market. Most of your team possess a basic understanding of how the stock market works and how they can integrate this knowledge into the code. However, one of the senior members on your team is panicking because they don’t think they’re great at finance. Another team member, who’s been making significant progress, remarks, “Why are you telling us this information now? We need to complete this code by end of the week. It might be a good idea for you to try and transition to another team until then.” The rest of the team stays silent because they’re frustrated as well.

After reviewing this situation, reflect on the following questions and note your answers:

- Do you think the team demonstrated empathy?

- What aspects of high EQ did the team demonstrate or not?

- Rather than asking their teammate to consider transitioning to another team, what could the team do to help them?

## Reflect on your EQ

Review the following questions. Think about your responses and note them down. Note areas that you need to work on more than others:

- When you feel anxious or worried, do you have coping techniques?

- Are you comfortable deciphering social cues from people around you?

- Can you name your emotions as you’re feeling them?

- Do you find it difficult to regroup after receiving bad news or facing a setback?

- How will you encourage open and respectful communication in a group setting?

- When something upsets you, can you manage your emotions and balance yourself?

- Are you able to step back from disappointments and challenges rather than getting stuck in how they make you feel?

Try practicing your EQ the next time you find yourself saying, “What can I do to get through this?” Remember from the video: EQ is a way of gaining agency in a difficult situation so that you can effectively and constructively move towards solving the problem at hand.
