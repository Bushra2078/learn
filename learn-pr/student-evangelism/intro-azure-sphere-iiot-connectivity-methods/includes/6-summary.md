As an energy manager, you are tasked with protecting your company's infrastructure from power fluctuations arising from the energy suppliers. To achieve this goal, your energy management systems need to capture data from a diverse range of sensors in a secure manner.

Azure Sphere lets you connect IoT devices with multiple connectivity options. Hence, you can connect many sensors to the energy management system, thereby capturing a complete picture of the threats to your infrastructure. 

If you could not avail of multiple connectivity options, you would not be able to connect sensors in diverse and remote areas, leaving your infrastructure at risk. You would also not be able to receive over-the-air OS and cloud updates from the Azure Sphere Security Service. 

With multiple connectivity options, you can now connect Azure Sphere to sensors securely and achieve better energy management.
