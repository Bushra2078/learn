  title: Check your Knowledge
  questions:
    - content: 'Which statement best describes the treatment and control groups for this study?'
      choices:
        - content: The treatment group was the 80 villages visited by recruiters, and the control group was the other 80 villages with no intervention.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The treatment is exposure to job opportunities for women.
        - content: The treatment group was the 160 villages selected, and the control group was the rest of the villages outside the capital of India.
          explanation: Incorrect. Not all of the 160 villages received treatment.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: The treatment group was the girls in India, and the control group was the boys in India.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The treatment was applied to the entire village, regardless of gender.
        - content: There is no clear notion of treatment and control group in this study.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The study had a distinct treatment that was applied to the treatment group.
    - content: 'Was this study an observational study, a randomized controlled experiment, or a randomized observational study?'
      choices:
        - content: This study was an observational study.
          explanation: Incorrect. There was a treatment applied, which means the study is not purely observational.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: This study was a randomized controlled experiment.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The treatment was applied to randomly selected villages, with a control group. This makes the study a randomized controlled experiment.
        - content: This study was a randomized observational study.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The study applied a treatment to one of the groups, which makes it not an observational study.
    - content: 'The study found that "Girls aged 5-15 in villages that received the recruiting services were 3 to 5 percentage points more likely to be in school." Does the study provide evidence that receiving recruiting services leads to an increase in the chance that girls are in school?'
      choices:
        - content: Yes, the study provides evidence of a causal link.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The study was a randomized controlled experiment, allowing assumptions of causality.
        - content: No, the study does not provide evidence for causation because of confounding factors.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Randomizing which villages to apply the treatment to sufficiently minimized confounding factors in a randomized controlled experiment.
        - content: There is not enough information to tell.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
