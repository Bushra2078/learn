One way to meet people in your new organization is to join clubs and social groups. In this exercise, you'll create a series of activities that can help you integrate into the group.

## Book one-on-one meetings

Your first three months are an important opportunity to set the stage for the rest of your career. Try this suggestion for meeting new people and getting yourself known.

1. Make a list of 10 people in your new organization whom you'd like to meet. 
1. Write down one question you'd like to ask of each of them, and schedule a coffee/tea chat with one per week.

For example:
* Book a one-on-one meeting with a project manager. Ask about the processes employed by the team and what approaches team members take to visualizing what they're working on.
* Book a one-on-one meeting with a team lead. Ask about how long it ordinarily takes for a new employee to get up to speed with how things work in the organization. 

## Find new ways to network: Make a list of hobbies

What do you like to do? Make a list of your hobbies. Try to include both indoor and outdoor activities. 

Think outside the box: 
* If you had unlimited time, what hobby you would like to try?
* What kind of hobby can be best done with a group?
  
  For example, if you're a painter, there might be an art club to join.

## Join a group

Now, do some research about the various social groups in your company.

* Note some details about groups that interest you. Are there any upcoming activities on their calendar?

   For example: HOLA, your organization's Hispanic group, hosts a cooking class the first Wednesday of each month.

* Groups to watch for:

  - Outdoors clubs
  - Music groups
  - Cooking clubs
  - Social-good clubs
  - Ethnic or multicultural groups
  - Art groups

## Attend an activity and network

When you attend a social group activity, make it a point to get to know one or more people in that group. Build your network by inviting them for a tea/coffee chat.

- Ask these people for tips on other activities to try.

  Keep a growth mindset and try something new!

- Follow up on any invitations you receive.

  Consider pairing with an employee in a new group if you're shy.

- Send a thank-you note to the activity organizer after the activity.

  Organizers always appreciate courteous people.
