## Exercise 

Make a list of your hobbies. Try to include both indoor and outdoor activities. Think outside the box: if you had unlimited time, what's a hobby you would like to try? Now, do some research about the various social groups in your company and make a point of joining one or more.

Groups to watch for: 

- outdoors clubs
- music groups
- cooking clubs
- social-good clubs
- ethnic or multicultural groups
- art groups

When attending a social group activity, make it a point to reach out to someone in your group and invite them for a tea/coffee chat to build your network. Ask these people for tips on other activities to try. Send a thank-you note to the activity organizer after the activity.
