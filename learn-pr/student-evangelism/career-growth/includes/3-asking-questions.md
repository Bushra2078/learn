It's an old saying that "you don't know what you don't know", but there's truth in this adage! You need to cultivate a curious mind to best make use of your time at your new company. Here are some ways to ask the right questions.

## Asking for feedback

Ask for specific feedback from your manager, teammates, and colleagues. What is expected of you? It's best to know this up front so that you can perform a task and then ask how you can improve in execution. Make notes of this feedback and review your documentation periodically. Here is [a course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/asking-for-feedback-as-an-employee/why-you-should-ask-for-feedback?u=3322) on how to ask for feedback as an employee.

## Asking for clarifications

Have you ever had something explained to you with terms such as 'simply' or 'just'? How did that make you feel? Watch for reductive words like this when your colleagues are explaining something. Often, it means they are glossing over what they consider to be 'common knowledge' but it may be something deeper: a lack of knowledge.  

If you're afraid of being annoying, don't be. This is your moment to get clarifications, although you should always try to find the answer yourself before asking for help. You have the power to ask for clarifications when you feel something is unclear. Common knowledge isn't common if it hasn't yet arrived for the interns, and acronyms are probably confusing for other people as well as yourself.

## Asking 'why', not 'how'

When you ask questions, make sure to ask not only how to do something, but _why_ it's important to do it. Having this context will let you learn how the business operates and what are its underlying values. Always keep in mind that your questions will help you deepen your technical skills as well as your domain expertise, both of which you will use throughout your evolving career path.

## Active listening

In a good internship you are primarily listening and learning. Take the time to speak to all kinds of people in your company, those who understand code, those who understand the business, and those amazing people who understand both. Practice active listening by:

- Establishing rapport with the speaker by listening more than you speak
- Demonstrating your empathy and concern with what they are saying by using good body language
- Asking specific questions, including follow-up questions
- Using verbal affirmations such as 'I see'
