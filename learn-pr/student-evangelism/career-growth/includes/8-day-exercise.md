You have a lot of control over the cadence of your day, more than you might realize once you get caught up in scheduled meetings and coding sprints. Take time to analyze yourself to determine how you work best, and try to align your day to your objectives.
## Make a planner

Take a few minutes to think about your ideal working day. Make a small 'planner' page for yourself. Create a table with eight blocks to reflect an eight hour day.

1. Map out your focus time
   
   > Try to build in a part of each day to focus on tasks that take a lot of concentration, such as learning or programming.

2. Map out your breaks
   
   > Build in a few 10-minute moments per day when you can stretch or have a beverage. Don't forget your lunch!
   
3. Map out your preferred meeting times
   
   > You might not be able to have your meetings aligned to this preference, but at least you will go into a meeting prepared and knowledgeable about your own state of mind.

## Reflect

Now, take a step back and reflect on your preferred working patterns. 

1. How long do you tend to work before needing to take a break? 

    > The amount of focus time you need is dependent on this value.
  
2. Are you more productive in the mornings or in the afternoon? 

    > If you see that you tend to need more breaks in a given time slot, that indicates that you are more productive and can focus more at other times of day.
  
3. When are meetings most productive for you?

    > If you can align your breaks between meetings, that frees up more time for focus.

## Compare

Compare your ideal work day to your current calendar. 

1. Can you optimize your focus times to occur at your peak productive moments? 
   
   > You might be able to block your calendar for this focus time.

2. Can you request your manager to book 1x1s during your preferred meeting times?
   
   > Your meetings might be more productive if you can group them together.
