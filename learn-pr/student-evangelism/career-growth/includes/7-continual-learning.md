At this point, you have gone through how to network and how to build a professional reputation by learning to deliver well and having good habits. The last piece of the puzzle is about your mindset. Having the right mindset will set you up for success, not only as an intern but for hopefully the long career that will follow.

## Growth mindset versus fixed mindset

A fixed mindset isn't set up to handle changes well, it usually takes on a negative thought pattern, thinking that things will never change, abilities, and conditions will never change, they are fixed.

A growth mindset on the other hand, does not have those restrictions, it believes that things can change over time.

Here's an example of a fixed mindset vs growth mindset:

|Fixed mindset  | Growth mindset  |
|---------|---------|
|I will never pass this calculus exam, I've failed two times already     | I can see I've improved between attempts, I'm sure I will do even better at the next attempt        |
| I can't take on this project, I don't know the skills enough | I don't know the skills enough yet, but I can learn |

Apart from situation based, it's also how you look at certain words. Here's an example:

|Fixed mindset  |Growth mindset  |
|---------|---------|
|Failure     | Experimentation         |
|Feedback | Chance for growth |
|Challenge | Learning opportunity |  




Adopt a growth mindset, it will take you further than you ever thought possible.



## How to respond to different situations

A growth mindset can be used in various situations. By knowing how to respond in those situations, you come out stronger from them rather than exhausted.

- **Feedback**. You will get feedback, both good and bad. Depending on how you tackle it, you might have a growth moment. Be open to it, especially the bad feedback. Is it critiquing how you did things or you personally? Can you grow from it?
- **Skills**. Being in tech means you need to learn new things all the time. A way to ensure that this process becomes natural is to understand how you learn. Some people find out straight away how they best learn, other take decades.

## Dealing with feedback

To grow, feedback is important. Regardless of whether the feedback is good or bad, it needs to be detailed and actionable. Here's an example of feedback that's hard to deal with but that you can learn from, if asking the right questions:

> This presentation was bad

You're most likely thinking oh, ok. 

At this point you can ask for clarifications like:

> Was it all bad, or did you like certain parts? How could I have done it differently?

In situation such as this one, usually the presentation isn't all bad, there was maybe an important thing you forgot to mention. A good course of action is to seek out this person before a new presentation next time, ask for feedback on slides, maybe even do a dry run of the presentation just for them.

## Work on your skills - become a continual learner

You are likely to change your tech stack many times throughout your career so you need to relearn everything you know every few years. Especially as an intern, there's many new things to learn, so you need to find out how you best learn new information.

A mindset that can be useful is that of 'growth-hacking'. Growth-hacking, a term [derived from the marketing industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking), can be personalized as valuing rapid experimentation and cross-disciplinary learning. It is all about continual improvement, and that is a mindset that is valuable to cultivate.

Think of your new job as combining both a skill and domain knowledge. You need to grow your expertise in both.

Let's think about some ways to growth-hack your learning process and thereby cultivate an 'always learning' mentality.

### Self-study

As an intern, you will likely run into a ton of new information that you need to learn. Find the best way that you learn, experiment with different modalities, video, text, whatever suites you.

As Socrates said, "know thyself". How do you learn? Are you a visual learner? You might benefit from doodling, or drawing sketch notes as you learn a new concept. If you need structured frameworks around your learning, consider bullet-journaling as you read.  

Do you prefer learning via videos? Make a curated playlist for yourself on YouTube. Are you someone who learns with articles and books? You can get online copies and add highlights and margin notes using various software. You are the owner of your own learning, but there are lots of helpful tools and techniques to aid your process. 

Set yourself a goal of learning one new thing every day. This new thing doesn't have to be a tech-related activity! Sometimes even your hobbies can inform your grasp of technical topics.

### Finding a safe place to build, break, and fix things

It seems strange, but it's important to break things (not in production, of course, and not such that it impacts your coworkers!). Find opportunities and safe places to build things, rebuild them, fix them, and break them.  

A great deal of learning can happen when you are obliged to work through the process of building, breaking and fixing things.

> [!TIP]
> Be humble. Be sure to listen and learn as much as you can. A good moment for this kind of learning can occur during code reviews, which should be handled in an empathetic way.

### Write it down

Some people are visual learners, so consider writing or sketching your problem on paper before trying to express it in code on a computer.

Write about what you learn and publish it on a technical blog, so that you are attaching quality vetted technical content to your name. You'll build your personal brand and benefit your community at the same time. Take 15 minutes each evening to journal about what you learned that day.

Document your work to keep your manager informed of your progress and save a copy of it for yourself so that you can look back at your trajectory. This documentation will also help the next intern on the team.  

Keep track of your wins and build a 'hype doc' as a personal database that you can refer to when asked to explain your trajectory. This will eventually help you to advocate for yourself either to gain advancement in your new company or to impress your next company. You'll end up constructing narratives that you can reflect on in your next job search.



### Your human skills

Continual improvement doesn't only mean learning about new technical advances. It also involves honing your human skills - your communication, listening, and empathy skills. It turns out that advancing in a career often has more to do with great human skills rather than stellar technical expertise, although both can and often do go hand in hand.
