## Exercise

Take a few minutes to think about your ideal working day. Make a small 'planner' page for yourself. Create a table with eight blocks to reflect an eight hour day.

1. Map out your focus time
2. Map out your breaks
3. Map out your preferred meeting times

Now, take a step back and reflect on your preferred working patterns. How long do you work before taking a break? Are you more productive in the mornings or in the afternoon? When are meetings most productive for you?

Compare your ideal work day to your current calendar. Can you optimize your focus times to occur at your peak productive moments? Can you request your manager to book 1x1s during your preferred meeting times?

> Tip: Add reminders into your calendar to stand up and stretch, and take your eyes off of screens for a few minutes.
