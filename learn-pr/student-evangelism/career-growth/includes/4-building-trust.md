Carrying out a technical task might be challenging enough but you will need to think about how you are perceived. What you want to be perceived as is someone that delivers on time and communicates well by asking the right questions. 

You are new in an organization and as such are a unknown quantity to your colleagues. By building your trust as an employee and managing your relationships proactively, you will build your personal brand as someone to be appreciated and, eventually, given responsibility and considered for promotion.

## Building trust as an employee

Good managers are looking for valuable, trustworthy employees who contribute to the organization by providing solid impact. Great managers also value those individuals who bring their whole selves to work, who come as they are, and who grow.

Scenario: It's a common mistake to come in new and think you will impress everyone by promising to deliver a ton of work. Most likely you are setting yourself up for failure. What you want to do is find a small focused task and identify other smaller tasks you can deliver on top of that, if time permits. At this point, if you deliver on that smaller commitment everyone will see you as trustworthy and if you deliver those extra things on top of that, you will start to impress people. 

The idea is to:

> Under promise and over deliver

## Manage time

An important part of your professional life is learning how to manage your time, not only where you spend your time but how you think about time.

### Be on time

Ensure you are on time in the morning, for meetings or whatever it is. If you know your bus is always running late, ensure you are at work 30 minutes, or more before you're supposed to.

> [!TIP]
> It's common that managers are there early for work, and if you and them are the only ones there in the morning, it's an excellent opportunity to have a quick chat over coffee or tea.

### Your time is finite - use it well

There's eight hours in day, no more, no less. That time is all you have to be as impactful as possible. Your day will most likely be filled with various activities like meetings, focus time and breaks. You need to plan for all these activities. Your company might decide when lunch is but you are likely in control of part of your day. Ensure you get a longer block of uninterrupted time to focus. 

> [!TIP]
> Also, plan for breaks. It's common to get a break through on a problem when you are not inherently focusing on it.

### You need down time - practice self-care

It's tempting, when starting a new job, to put 100% of your attention towards your work. You might be tempted to be the last person to leave the office, do much unpaid overtime, work weekends, and socialize off-hours with your colleagues. A little of this goes a long way. Let's discuss time management as a new intern.

Rest, hydrate, eat well, and exercise. Cultivate a social life outside your job. You should try to become friendly and collegial with coworkers. Don't, however, center your entire world around that small circle. Remember, it's unlikely that your first job will be your last, so meet and make friends with many people outside your work.

Don't forget to take breaks during your work hours. Take care of your posture and eyes. Programming can be tough on eyesight and sitting still for hours is bad for your health. If you have access to a standing desk, that can be helpful to maintain your posture. Ask your company if they can help you set up your work space with ergonomic standards in mind. 

Software engineering and all the learning you are doing in this position are mentally taxing, so make sure to get enough rest.

## "Manage up"

The concept of '[managing up](https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up)' is not inherently disrespectful to a manager. Rather, it is the idea that managers may not know enough of the details of your current situation to be able to collaborate with you to grow your career. Be as open with your manager as you can.

How your manager sees you is key to whether this intern position will turn into a full-time position. It's important to have a good relation with your manager and way to ensure that, is by asking questions that will help you get a good understanding of how you are doing.

Here are some questions you can ask your manager to help frame conversations:

"Where do you see me in one year? Five years? Ten years?"

"What can I do to better align myself with the department's strategies and goals?"

"What resources are available to me to grow my knowledge base and keep learning?"

"What do you see as my strengths? My weaknesses? How can I amplify one and improve the other?"

## Asking for feedback

Ask for specific feedback from your manager, teammates, and colleagues. What is expected of you? It's best to know this up front so that you can perform a task and then ask how you can improve in execution. Make notes of this feedback and review your documentation periodically.

> [!TIP] A good idea is to ask for two things you do well and an area which you can grow in. Ask for specific examples so you understand how you could have done a situation differently.

You should know by the end of an internship how much you have grown and what people think of your performance.
