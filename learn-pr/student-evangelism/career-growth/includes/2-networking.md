When you start out as an intern, there are three major areas you need to work on at the same time, your professional reputation, your mindset, and your networking skills. 

Scenario: Imagine the following situation: you've been working hard on delivering on a project and no one knows about the project or have heard of you. Does that matter? If your closest manager is the only one who decides on whether to hire you full time or not, it might not be a problem. More often than not, there are many people involved in the hiring decision, and they need to know about you and your work. The solution lies in networking, while working hard to deliver on your commitments.

> Being able to network is an important skill not only as an intern, but as you continue to grow into a full-time position.

When you are a new employee or intern, you can feel like a stranger in a strange land. There are concrete steps you can take, however, to connect to people in your new company.

## Your first weeks

There are many ways to network but a way to think about it, is as a timeline, what can I do today versus a few weeks in?

When you walk in the door of a new organization or open an online meeting space as a new hire, it can be daunting and a little scary. Perhaps you have been assigned an onboarding buddy or are quickly assimilated into your department or group. But if not, you're going to have to proactively seek out valuable connections.

### Book 1:1s

The first thing you want to do is map out your closest surroundings, who's your closest colleagues, your manager and skip level manager and what do they do? Once you know who's who, start booking meetings.

Schedule 1x1s and coffee/tea chats or even online and in-person lunch-and-learn type meetings with many different people to glean their diverse perspectives. Does your company have 'ERG' or Employee Resource Groups such as a women's group or a multi-ethnic employee group? Are you aware of any groups across the company that meet to discuss interests or hobbies? Groups like these, are great groups to join to meet new people.

> Schedule 'coffee/tea chats' or 'lunch and learns' with the folks closest to you first. 

### Who to contact

As a rule of thumb, it's better to get to know the ones closest to you first, your colleagues on your team. But who to reach out to after that? Here's a list of approaches to grow your network further:

- **Social media**. If you follow someone from your new company on social media and you enjoy their point of view, reach out and ask for lunch. You are in a privileged position especially if you are an intern, and few people will refuse to speak to you. Take advantage of this moment in your career to benefit!

- **By recommendation** Ask your manager for their recommendations of interesting people to meet, and then ask those people for their recommendations. Soon you will have created a network of valuable contacts. 

- **Voices from the business**. In a good internship, you are primarily listening and learning. Take the time to speak to all kinds of people in your company, those folks who understand code, those folks who understand the business, and those amazing people who understand both. Practice active listening by:

  - Establishing rapport with the speaker by listening more than you speak
  - Demonstrating your empathy and concern with what they are saying by using good body language
  - Asking specific questions, including follow-up questions
  - Using verbal affirmations such as 'I see'

### What to talk about

Ok, you've managed to book a number of 'coffee/tea chat' or 'lunch and learns', what do you talk about? A good idea is to talk to your coworkers and ask them what they wish they had done in their last year of school. Ask them what they wish they knew when they were getting started and take notes. Someday, an intern may ask you the same question.

> If you need to, write down a list of questions to ask and take notes. You might be surprised by what you learn.

As a new employee, take the opportunity to build your network as broadly as you can from inside your organization.

## A few weeks in

So you've been at the company a few weeks. You are starting to get to know a few of your colleagues. You've done a 'coffee chat' or two. At this point, it's a good idea to find someone to help guide you. A mentor is able to provide guidance on how to grow, maybe they have a network to share and so on.

### Find a mentor

Some companies provide a formal mentorship program, while others do not. Find a mentor by cultivating personal relationships within your department at work, or attend company events that will give you access to new groups of people with whom you do not work.

Don't be shy to ask someone to be your mentor, but be aware that it involves a time commitment on both your parts.

> [!TIP]
> Consider asking your manager if you can take time for mentorship, if it's not built into your daily work by the company.  

> **A story from Twitter** [Will Thompson](https://twitter.com/Will_MI77) recalls a moment from his early career involving a famous CEO who "presented to me and a bunch of new grads once, and said that an intern had once asked him to be their mentor. He couldn't come up with a good reason to say no! He swiftly followed the anecdote by saying "that only works the first time!"

Set parameters collaboratively with your mentor, agreeing to meet for a given number of hours each month for a given number of months. Set goals for yourself and hold yourself accountable to meet them each month. Be sure to come prepared with questions or scenarios that you'd like your mentors input on.  

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to thank your mentor for their time!

### Attend internal events

As an intern, you might not attend conferences, but many companies are hosting external user groups or have dedicated time meant for employees to learn to discover new technologies. Take part in those events, do you your best to engage, learn something new, get to know other people from other departments.
