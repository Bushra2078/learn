It's tempting, when starting a new job, to put 100% of you attention towards your work. You might be tempted to be the last person to leave the office, do a lot of unpaid overtime, work weekends, and socialize off-hours with your colleagues. A little of this goes a long way. Let's discuss time management as a new employee.

## You are not your code

Do you define yourself as 'a [insert language here] developer' or do you say 'I develop software with [insert language].' That's an important distinction to make. You are more than a code-producing machine. Think about how to make your work more visible and appreciated by spending time discussing it with others.

## Don't overdo it

If your management requests all-night coding sessions or you feel compelled to work a lot of overtime, that's actually a sign of bad mannagement. Is your team understaffed, is the deadline unrealistic, is there simply too much work to do, or are the requirements changing constantly? This is a sign of an unhealthy environment, and it's appropriate to consult with your management or HR to effect changes.

## Practice self-care

Rest, hydrate, eat well, and exercise. Cultivate a social life outside your job. That doesn't mean that you can't be friends with co-workers, but don't center your entire world around that small circle. Remember, it's unlikely that your first job will be your last, so meet and make friends with many people outside your work.

Don't forget to take breaks during your work hours. Take care of your posture and eyes - programming can be tough on eyesight and sitting still for hours is very bad for your health. If you have access to a standing desk, that can be very helpful to maintain your posture. Ask your company if they can help you set up your work space with ergonometrics in mind.

Software engineering and all the learning you are doing in this position are mentally taxing, so make sure to get enough rest.
