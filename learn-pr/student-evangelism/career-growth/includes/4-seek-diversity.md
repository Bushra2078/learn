It's a well-known fact that cultivating a diverse mindset and gathering diverse perspectives will improve your point of view as a person. How can you apply that in your job?

## Discover new communities

There are all kinds of supportive technical communities both inside and outside the company that can help you feel included in your domain. Software developers have a myriad of tech meetups in which they can participate but there are other overarching communities and that you can follow by searching for terms like #CodeNewbie or #WomenInTech hashtags on social media.

While you are discovering new perspectives, take the time to understand the audience who will use your software and develop with empathy. Your code will be much better for gathering these perspectives before starting a sprint.

## Try new things

Your first job is your moment to try all kinds of new things. You may not enjoy doing some things, but you would not have gathered this knowledge without trying. Keep an open mind and don't forget to have fun!

## Pair with people outside your domain

Your company is made up of all kinds of people including administrative folks, Human Resources staff, salespeople, people managers, and developers. Take the time to understand how each of these folks do their job by shadowing them or pairing with them. Eat lunch with all different kinds of people, and make sure to chat with people in non-technical departments. This small action will expand your horizons and help you to understand how the company functions.

## Look around

If you look around and realize that everyone around you looks like you, you need to expand your horizons. It may be true that "like likes like" but that doesn't produce a quality work experience or environment. Look for teams with diverse people and try to collaborate with them. Coworkers who come from different backgrounds compared to yours will challenge your preconceptions and biases and show you different approaches and techniques to solving problems.
