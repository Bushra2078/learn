One way to meet people in your new organization is to join clubs and social groups. In this exercise, you will create a series of activities that will help you integrate into the group.

## Make a list

What do you like to do? Make a list of your hobbies. Try to include both indoor and outdoor activities. Think outside the box: if you had unlimited time, what's a hobby you would like to try?

1. What kind of hobby can be best done with a group?

   > For example, if you are a painter, there might be an art club to join.

## Join a group

Now, do some research about the various social groups in your company.

1. Note some details about groups that interest you, including upcoming activities

   > Example: HOLA, your organization's Hispanic group, hosts a cooking class the first Wednesday of each month.

Groups to watch for:

- Outdoors clubs
- Music groups
- Cooking clubs
- Social-good clubs
- Ethnic or multicultural groups
- Art groups

## Attend an activity and network

When attending a social group activity, make it a point to reach out to someone in your group and invite them for a tea/coffee chat to build your network.

- Ask these people for tips on other activities to try.

  > Keep a growth mindset and try something new!

- Follow up on any invitations you receive.

  > Consider pairing with an employee in a new group if you are shy.

- Send a thank-you note to the activity organizer after the activity.

  > Organizers always remember polite folks! Gratitude is very much appreciated.
