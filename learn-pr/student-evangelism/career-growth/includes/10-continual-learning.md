Adopting a continually-learning mindset early in your career will pay off in the long term. There are some good habits you can cultivate now to set you on the path towards always learning.

## Becoming a continual learner

If you just graduated from an educational program, it can be daunting to think that, in engineering disciplines, you must always be ready to learn something new. This doesn't mean that you have to jump right back into a higher degree program, rather, it is embracing a mindset.

A mindset that can be useful is that of 'growth-hacking'. Growth-hacking, a term [derived from the marketing industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking), can be personalized as valuing rapid experimentation and cross-disciplinary learning. It is all about continual improvement, and that is a mindset that is valuable to cultivate.

Think of your new job as combining both a skill and domain knowledge. You need to grow your expertise in both.

In marketing, the idea of 'growth' involves growing value or a user base through experimentation. But as a person, you can borrow this concept to invest in yourself.

Let's think about some ways to growth-hack your learning process and thereby cultivate an 'always learning' mentality.

## Self-study

As Socrates said, "know thyself". How do you learn? Are you a very visual learner? You might benefit from doodling, or drawing sketchnotes as you learn a new concept. If you need structured frameworks around your learning, consider bullet-journaling as you read.  

Do you prefer learning via videos? Make a curated playlist for yourself on YouTube. Are you someone who learns with articles and books? You can get online copies and add highlights and margin notes using various software. You are the owner of your own learning, but there are lots of helpful tools and techniques to aid your process. 

Set yourself a goal of learning one new thing every day. This new thing doesn't have to be a tech-related activity! Sometimes even your hobbies can inform your grasp of technical topics.

## Formal study

Some companies support their employees in continuing education in accredited programs. If so, you can weigh the amount of time needed to complete a nanodegree or university degree, and consider applying. Continuing your education is never a waste of time.

Take the time to learn in-depth. Taking formal courses is a great way to deepen your knowledge, and many can be taken inexpensively or might even be sponsored by your company as continuing education opportunities.

Don't compare yourself to others as you learn either formally or on your own. You know yourself best, so go at your own pace.

## Finding a safe place to build, break and fix things

It seems strange, but it's actually important to break things (not in production, of course, and not such that it impacts your coworkers!). Find opportunities and safe places to build things, rebuild them, fix them, and break them.  

A great deal of learning can happen when you are obliged to work through the process of building, breaking and fixing things.

Be humble. Be sure to listen and learn as much as you can. A good moment for this kind of learning can occur during code reviews, which should be handled in an empathetic way.

## Write it down

Some people are very visual learners, so consider writing or sketching your problem on paper before trying to express it in code on a computer.

Write about what you learn and publish it on a technical blog, so that you are attaching quality vetted technical content to your name. You'll build your personal brand and benefit your community at the same time. Take 15 minutes each evening to journal about what you learned that day.

Document your work to keep your manager informed of your progress and save a copy of it for yourself so that you can look back at your trajectory. This documentation will also help the next intern on the team.  

Keep track of your wins and build a 'hype doc' as a personal database that you can refer to when asked to explain your trajectory. This will eventually help you to advocate for yourself either to gain advancement in your new company or to impress your next company. You'll end up constructing narratives that you can reflect on in your next job search.

## Side projects

If you can, take time to build side projects on GitHub to crystalize your learning and build your technical portfolio. Learning in this way takes the risk out of breaking code and gives you the opportunity to get 'code muscle memory' as you iterate on your ideas.  

You will also have the opportunity to practice what you learn using various open-source libraries, perhaps with the eventual outcome that you might contribute to them, furthering your advancement as a good community member. Employees often appreciate these kind of contributions.

## Your human skills

Continual improvement doesn't only mean learning about new technical advances. It also involves honing your human skills - your communication, listening, and empathy skills. It turns out that advancing in a career often has more to do with great human skills rather than stellar technical expertise, although both can and often do go hand in hand.
