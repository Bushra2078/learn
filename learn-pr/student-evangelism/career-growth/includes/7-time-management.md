It's tempting, when starting a new job, to put 100% of your attention towards your work. You might be tempted to be the last person to leave the office, do a lot of unpaid overtime, work weekends, and socialize off-hours with your colleagues. A little of this goes a long way. Let's discuss time management as a new employee.
## Practice self-care 

Rest, hydrate, eat well, and exercise. Cultivate a social life outside your job. That doesn't mean that you can't be friends with co-workers, but don't center your entire world around that small circle. Remember, it's unlikely that your first job will be your last, so meet and make friends with many people outside your work. 

Don't forget to take breaks during your work hours. Take care of your posture and eyes - programming can be tough on eyesight and sitting still for hours is very bad for your health. If you have access to a standing desk, that can be very helpful to maintain your posture. Ask your company if they can help you set up your work space with ergonometric standards in mind. 

Software engineering and all the learning you are doing in this position are mentally taxing, so make sure to get enough rest.
