[The Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) has
flummoxed many people over the years, [mathematicians
included](https://web.archive.org/web/20140413131827/http://www.decisionsciences.org/DecisionLine/Vol30/30_1/vazs30_1.pdf).
Let's see if we can work it out by simulation.

The setting is derived from a TV game show called "Let's Make a
Deal". Monty Hall hosted this show in the 1960s, and it has since led
to a number of spin-offs. An exciting part of the show was that while
the contestants had the chance to win great prizes, they might instead
end up with "zonks" that were less desirable. This is the basis for what
is now known as *the Monty Hall problem*.

The setting is a game show in which the contestant is faced with three
closed doors. Behind one of the doors is a fancy car, and behind each of
the other two there's a goat. The contestant doesn't know where the car
is, and has to attempt to find it under the following rules.

- The contestant makes an initial choice, but that door isn't opened.
- At least one of the other two doors must have a goat behind it.
    Monty opens one of these doors to reveal a goat, displayed in all
    its glory in
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem):

    ![Monty Hall goat](../media/monty-hall-goat.png)

- There are two doors left, one of which was the contestant's original
    choice. One of the doors has the car behind it, and the other one
    has a goat. The contestant now gets to choose which of the two doors
    to open.

The contestant has a decision to make. Which door should they choose to
open, if they wants the car? Should they stick with their initial choice, or switch to the other door? That is the Monty Hall problem.

### The solution

In any problem involving chances, the assumptions about randomness are
important. It's reasonable to assume that there's a 1/3 chance that the
contestant's initial choice is the door that has the car behind it.

The solution to the problem is straightforward under this
assumption, though the straightforward solution doesn't convince
everyone. Here it is anyway:

- The chance that the car is behind the originally chosen door is 1/3.
- The car is behind either the originally chosen door or the door that remains. It can't be anywhere else.
- Therefore, the chance that the car is behind the door that remain is 2/3.
- Therefore, the contestant should switch.

That's it. End of story.

Not convinced? Then let's simulate the game and see how the results turn
out.

### Simulation

The simulation will be more complex that those we've done so far.
Let's break it down.

### Step 1: What to simulate

For each play we'll simulate what's behind all three doors: - the one
the contestant first picks - the one that Monty opens - the remaining
door

So we'll be keeping track of three quantities, not just one.

### Step 2: Simulating one play

The bulk of our work consists of simulating one play of the game. This
involves several pieces.

#### The goats

We start by setting up an array `goats` that contains unimaginative
names for the two goats.

``` python
goats = make_array('first goat', 'second goat')
```

To help Monty conduct the game, we are going to have to identify which
goat is selected and which one is revealed behind the open door. The
function `other_goat` takes one goat and returns the other.

``` python
def other_goat(x):
    if x == 'first goat':
        return 'second goat'
    elif x == 'second goat':
        return 'first goat'
```

Let's confirm that the function works.

``` python
other_goat('first goat'), other_goat('second goat'), other_goat('watermelon')
```

```output
('second goat', 'first goat', None)
```

The string `'watermelon'` is not the name of one of the goats, so when
`'watermelon'` is the input then `other_goat` does nothing.

#### The options

The array `hidden_behind_doors` contains the set of things that could be
behind the doors.

``` python
hidden_behind_doors = make_array('car', 'first goat', 'second goat')
```

We are now ready to simulate one play. To do this, we'll define a
function `monty_hall_game` that takes no arguments. When the function is
called, it plays Monty's game once and returns a list consisting of:

- the contestant's guess
- what Monty reveals when they opens a door
- what remains behind the other door

The game starts with the contestant choosing one door at random. In
doing so, the contestant makes a random choice from among the car, the
first goat, and the second goat.

If the contestant happens to pick one of the goats, then the other goat
is revealed and the car is behind the remaining door.

If the contestant happens to pick the car, then Monty reveals one of the
goats and the other goat is behind the remaining door.

``` python
def monty_hall_game():
    """Return
    [contestant's guess, what Monty reveals, what remains behind the other door]"""

    contestant_guess = np.random.choice(hidden_behind_doors)

    if contestant_guess == 'first goat':
        return [contestant_guess, 'second goat', 'car']

    if contestant_guess == 'second goat':
        return [contestant_guess, 'first goat', 'car']

    if contestant_guess == 'car':
        revealed = np.random.choice(goats)
        return [contestant_guess, revealed, other_goat(revealed)]
```

Let's play! Run the cell several times and see how the results change.

``` python
monty_hall_game()
```

```output
['second goat', 'first goat', 'car']
```

### Step 3: Number of repetitions

To gauge the frequency with which the different results occur, we have
to play the game many times and collect the results. Let's run 10,000
repetitions.

### Step 4: Coding the simulation

It's time to run the whole simulation.

We'll play the game 10,000 times and collect the results in a table.
Each row of the table will contain the result of one play.

One way to grow a table by adding a new row is to use the `append`
method. If `my_table` is a table and `new_row` is a list containing the
entries in a new row, then `my_table.append(new_row)` adds the new row
to the bottom of `my_table`.

`append` doesn't create a new table. It changes `my_table` to
have one more row than it did before.

First let's create a table `games` that has three empty columns. We can
do this by just specifying a list of the column labels, as follows.

``` python
games = Table(['Guess', 'Revealed', 'Remaining'])
```

Notice that we have chosen the order of the columns to be the same as
the order in which `monty_hall_game` returns the result of one game.

Now we can add 10,000 rows to `trials`. Each row will represent the
result of one play of Monty's game.

``` python
# Play the game 10000 times and
# record the results in the table games

for i in np.arange(10000):
    games.append(monty_hall_game())
```

The simulation is done. Notice how short the code is. The majority of
the work was done in simulating the outcome of one game.

### Visualization

To see whether the contestant should stick with their original choice or
switch, let's see how frequently the car is behind each of their two
options.

``` python
original_choice = games.group('Guess')
original_choice
```

``` output
| Guess       | count |
|-------------|-------|
| car         | 3268  |
| first goat  | 3372  |
| second goat | 3360  |
```

``` python
remaining_door = games.group('Remaining')
remaining_door
```

``` output
| Remaining   | count |
|-------------|-------|
| car         | 6732  |
| first goat  | 1615  |
| second goat | 1653  |
```

As our earlier solution said, the car is behind the remaining door
two-thirds of the time, to a good approximation. The contestant
is twice as likely to get the car if they switch than if they sticks
with their original choice.

To see this graphically, we can join the two tables above and draw
overlaid bar charts.

``` python
joined = original_choice.join('Guess', remaining_door, 'Remaining')
combined = joined.relabeled(0, 'Item').relabeled(1, 'Original Door').relabeled(2, 'Remaining Door')
combined
```

``` output
| Item        | Original Door | Remaining Door |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| car         | 3268          | 6732           |
| first goat  | 3372          | 1615           |
| second goat | 3360          | 1653           |
```

``` python
combined.barh(0)
```

Notice how the three blue bars are almost equal--the original choice
is equally likely to be any of the three available items. But the gold
bar corresponding to `Car` is twice as long as the blue.

The simulation confirms that the contestant is twice as likely to win if
they switch.
