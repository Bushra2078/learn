title: Simulate and generate empirical distributions in Python
summary: Learn how to simulate and generate empirical distributions in Python
abstract: |
  The UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational 
  thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that 
  data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming 
  and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, 
  document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data 
  analysis such as privacy and design.
  
  ***Produced in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley - Ani Adhikari and John Denero with Contributions from David Wagner[Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html).*** 

  In this module, you will:
  - Study the idea of randomness, analyzed its importance, learned relevant terminology and studied the Law of Averages.
  - Examine different types of samples and different sampling techniques.
  - Learn about empirical & probability distributions and their differences.
  - Explore various components of a simulation and simulate a statistic.
