In this unit, we define the academic requirements for creating a new degree program that implements certification. Developing a new degree program is a substantial undertaking. A program and the way it's developed must adhere to many institutional processes and policies. One of the primary requirements for developing a new program is a market rationale and projected graduate outcomes.

The University of Lincoln planned to develop a new master's program in cloud computing. As a first step, an institution should undertake a market analysis of similar programs. Although businesses have a need for graduates who have cloud skills, there are few degree programs in the cloud computing space. Industry supports the development of cloud programs, with key practical components, and it supports implementing certifications to support business practices. Regardless of the type of technical program that's proposed, industry engagement is an important attribute.

If you're developing a new program for your home institution, you likely want to follow the general steps in which the program leader and teaching team:

1. Define the program academic domain and engage with relevant institutional services.
1. Engage with industry contacts who are aligned to the program domain.
1. Discuss the program proposal with industry experts to understand current technologies, their application areas, and their future direction.
1. Use industry needs to inform the program proposal.

The University of Lincoln engaged with industry partners in the cloud space, led an ACM Cloud Computing working group, and participated in the [Microsoft Learn for Educators Program](/training/roles/educator/learn-for-educators-overview?azure-portal=true). These engagements provided educators with access to industry expertise and a community of educators who share the common goal of delivering industry-aligned content and certification courses. An institution’s industry liaison or careers team also might help facilitate connections with suitable companies. Regardless of the topical area of your program that offers certification opportunities, it's essential to have the connection between academia and industry in the development process to ensure that the program's outcomes fit the intended purpose.

The following quote is from the University of Lincoln’s Master of Computer Science (MSc) Cloud Computing program. The quote highlights the importance of emphasizing the skill sets, job roles, and certifications that are part of the program outcomes:

*“Our MSc Cloud Computing program aims to provide students with an extensive learning experience that equips them with the cutting-edge skill sets required within the fast-growing cloud computing industry. Students have the opportunity to gain in-demand skills for professional roles such as Cloud Developers, Solution Architects, DevOps, and Data specialists.*

*A distinct feature of the program is the integration of cloud vendor certification that is aligned with program and module outcomes. This approach gives students the opportunity to demonstrate industry-transferable competencies in core areas whilst enhancing their employability attributes.”*
