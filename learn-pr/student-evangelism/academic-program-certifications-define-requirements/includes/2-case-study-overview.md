A case study demonstrates how to apply some of the approaches and processes we discuss in this module. Considering a case study can help you choose a certification implementation solution that works for your institution. 

The case study we'll look at highlights some of the general approaches that a UK institution—the University of Lincoln—adopted on its journey to implement Microsoft certifications in its Computer Science school. The approaches the university adopted were informed by the published outcomes of an international group of educators and industry experts that worked in an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Cloud Computing working group. Case study examples include offering certifications as extracurricular opportunities and full integration in a program, with optional academic credit.
