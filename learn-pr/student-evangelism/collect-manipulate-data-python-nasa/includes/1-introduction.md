Weather is tracked and analyzed every day to help airplanes ensure safe flights. Many weather conditions have to be monitored to ensure that the likelihood of something negative happening to the aircraft is as low as possible. With rocket launches, the risk and outcomes of a misreading or bit of untracked data can be devastating.

With higher altitudes, more power, and the inability to control the direction of the rocket, the accuracy of safe weather predictions is one of the most challenging and important parts of space exploration. The complexities increase even more when the timeline is taken into account. Launch dates are decided years in advance for massive scheduling and preparation efforts.

Though we don't have the subject matter expertise or access to as much weather data as NASA has, this module will guide you through using easily accessible weather data to simulate how NASA scientists approach the same problem. This module teaches you how to get basic weather data ready to train a machine learning model to predict what days are good days for rocket launches.

This module will look at:

- Conditions (cloudy, partly cloudy, fair, rain, thunder, heavy storm)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Wind direction
- Precipitation
- Visibility
- Sea level 
- Pressure

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Explore data about weather on days when rockets with crews and rockets without crews were launched.
- Explore data about weather on the days surrounding launch days.
- Clean the data in preparation for training the machine learning model.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code with Python and Jupyter extensions
- Some Python experience
