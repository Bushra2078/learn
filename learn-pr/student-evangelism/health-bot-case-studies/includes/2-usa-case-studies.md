Microsoft partners are using the Azure Health Bot service to build bots that address a wide range of healthcare-specific use cases. For example:

- Insurers have built bots that give their customers an easy way to look up the status of a claim and ask questions about benefits and services.
- Providers have built bots that triage patient issues with a symptom checker, help patients find appropriate care, and look up nearby doctors.

A great showcase for the impact of Health Bot to healthcare organizations is its wide use during the most challenging health crisis in decades, the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of those partners in the United States are as follows.

## CDC

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bot, which utilizes the Azure Health Bot service, can quickly:

- Assess the symptoms and risk factors for people worried about infection.
- Provide information and suggest a course of action, such as contacting a medical provider.  
- Help those who don't need in-person medical care to manage the illness safely at home.

## Providence

One of the largest health systems in the United States created a [healthcare chatbot named Grace](https://www.providence.org/news/uf/623601749) by using the Azure Health Bot service. Providence created Grace to help answer patients' questions online. 

By using CDC guidelines and its own clinical protocols, Providence then built a Coronavirus Assessment Tool in just three days for the communities that it serves. The tool helps people decide whether they should seek medical attention for their respiratory symptoms.  

## Walgreens

Walgreens, the global pharmacy and healthcare retail provider, [used Azure Health Bot to expand the Find Care platform](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/812836-walgreens-boots-alliance-retailers-azure-bot-service-cognitive-services) to include a COVID-19 risk assessment. Customers can use it to assess their risk of COVID-19 based on CDC guidelines.

## Aurora Health Care

## Premera Blue Cross

Premera Blue Cross improved its patient experience by implementing Scout, an intelligent virtual health assistant. Scout offers digital services such as checking healthcare claim status, eligibility, and health plans on Android and iOS.
