quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "For a distribution that's skewed towards the right, would the mean be to the left, to the right of the median, or will the mean and the median probably overlap?"
      choices:
        - content: 'Mean to the right of the median'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A distribution that's skewed towards the right will have mostly small data, and a few large outliers. Since the mean is more easily influence by outliers than the median, the mean will be larger then the median.
        - content: 'Mean to the left of the median'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'bin [4, 12)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'which of the following code will not correctly output the standard deviation of the array "any_numbers"?'
      choices:
        - content: 'np.sqrt(np.mean((any_numbers - np.mean(any_numbers))**2))'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect.'
        - content: 'np.sqrt(np.mean((any_numbers - np.mean(any_numbers))**2)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This code will return an error because of mis-matched parentheses
        - content: 'np.std(any_numbers)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
