In this module we firstly saw the way we interface our bot with Microsoft Teams app. The Unique Bot ID was obtained from the Azure Health bot platform. We mapped the scenario in the Models section and later used the ID to invoke bot on the Microsoft Teams app. Then we designed an app using the Teams app studio where we wrapped up the bot into an application. The Bot ID again played a major role to achieve this successfully.
