Consider the example of the developer who is deploying IoT applications in the cloud for a factory automation application. The developer wants to simulate both the behavior of the machine but also the behavior of the environment around the machine. The pre-built temperature sensor simulator module can help solve this problem when deployed at the edge. In the absence of this module, the developer will be unable to test their solution adequately because it is expensive to acquire both machine and ambient data. By using the pre-built simulated sensor module, the developer can be more assured that their application will perform as stipulated.

In this module, we could explore the following engineering led themes:  

**Forecasting behavior of a component or system**: Using simulated sensor data to predict the behavior of a system for testing.

**Design considerations:**  using simulated data to design features of the system.

**Working within constraints/tolerances and specific operating conditions:** Using simulated data to understand the boundary / threshold limitations of a solution.

**Safety and security considerations:** Using simulated data to understand the safety and boundary limitations of the system.

**Building tools that help to create the solution:** The temperature sensor acts as a tool to build the actual solution.
