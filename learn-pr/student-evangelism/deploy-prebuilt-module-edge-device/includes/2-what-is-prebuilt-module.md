Azure IoT Edge enables you to deploy code to your IoT Edge devices from the cloud. The IoT Edge platform works with the cloud to deploy IoT Edge modules. IoT Edge modules are executable packages implemented as containers. Through IoT Edge modules, you can deploy cloud workloads to run directly on IoT devices. IoT Edge Modules are accessed through the Azure Marketplace. Third-party publishers can also publish modules through the marketplace.  

IoT Edge modules are the smallest computation units managed by IoT Edge. Using IoT Edge modules, you can analyze data on devices instead of the cloud. By moving parts of your workload to the edge, your devices can spend less time sending messages to the cloud and react more quickly to events. Here, we use a pre-built module already existing in the marketplace. We'll deploy this module so that it will send telemetry data to IoT Hub. The module that you deploy simulates a sensor and sends generated data back to the IoT Hub. This module is useful because you can use the simulated data for development and testing your IoT solution.
