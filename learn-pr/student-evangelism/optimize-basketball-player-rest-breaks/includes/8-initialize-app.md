In earlier units, we created a CSV file named *game_stats.csv* that contains a row of stats for each of the 16 players across four time periods within one game. Now, it's time to read in the PER for each player for each quarter of the game, so we can use that information to decide which players might need a water break.

> [!NOTE]
> The GitHub repo that you cloned contains an example *game_stats.csv* file. If you want to replace that example file with the one you made, just copy it and paste it into the *space-jam-a-new-legacy-app* repository folder and replace the one that's there.

## Read the game_stats data into a JavaScript variable

Open the *main.js* file in Visual Studio Code. You should see global variables that we'll use throughout our application. Just after these variables is a function declaration:

```javascript
// A map of playerName to an array of playerPER values
var playerMap = new Map();

// Variables to keep track of constants
var perIndex = 9;
var numPlayers = 16;
var maxPlayersOnCourt = 5;
var secondsInQuarter = 12;
var numQuarters = 4;

// Variables to track state throughout the game
var currentQuarter = 0;
var playersOnCourt = 0;
var quarterInPlay = false;

// Variables to track PER throughout the game
var quarterPER = 0;
var quarterAvePER = 0;
var totalAvePER = 0;

// Function to read in all the player stats
function processPlayers(allPlayerStats) {
```

Now, we'll start writing our function to read in our data.

The first code comment is `Split the data by newline into an array`. The data being read in from the *game_stats.csv* file is coming in as one large string. To parse each row of data, we need to first split each row. Each row is delimited by a newline character. Using the `split(/\r\n|\n/)` function on the `allPlayerStats` parameter results in an array in which each element is a row from the CSV file. Name this array `allPlayerStatLines`.

```javascript
    // Split the data by newline into an array.
    var allPlayerStatLines = allPlayerStats.split(/\r\n|\n/);
```

Now, you have access to all the data in a JavaScript array, and you don't have to worry about accessing the CSV file anymore.

## Gather player name and PER data

Although we do have access to all the data in the `allPlayerStatLines` variable, we can do a little upfront work to make it easier to access only the data we really need: player name and PER for each of the four quarters. To get this data, we'll create a map of player names to a list of PER per quarter. Before we can create the map, we need to isolate each player's data.

Looking at the CSV file, we can see that, for example, Sylvester appears on line 1, and then again on lines 18, 34, and 50. It's because Sylvester has four stats to represent his status in each of the four quarters of the game. We'll need to account for that when creating the map of player data.

```javascript
    // Loop through the 16 players and create a map entry of player name to player stats.
    for (var playerIndex=1; playerIndex <= numPlayers; playerIndex++) {

        // Create variables to represent the four rows for each player's stats throughout the game.
        var playerLine0 = allPlayerStatLines[playerIndex].split(',');
        var playerLine12 = allPlayerStatLines[playerIndex+numPlayers].split(',');
        var playerLine24 = allPlayerStatLines[playerIndex+(numPlayers*2)].split(',');
        var playerLine36 = allPlayerStatLines[playerIndex+(numPlayers*3)].split(',');
```

With these variables, we can create the variables we need to create the map of player names to player PER. First, we take a substring of the PER value to essentially truncate the value to only two numbers after the decimal, and then we convert the PER string to a float. Creating these variables might be useful in a stretch project if you want to sort players based on their PER.

```javascript
        // Create variables to represent the player name, PER for each time period.
        var playerName = playerLine0[1];
        var playerPER0 = parseFloat(playerLine0[perIndex].substring(0,5));
        var playerPER12 = parseFloat(playerLine12[perIndex].substring(0,5));
        var playerPER24 = parseFloat(playerLine24[perIndex].substring(0,5));
        var playerPER36 = parseFloat(playerLine36[perIndex].substring(0,5));
```

Finally, we can add the player and their stats to the player map, and then loop around for the next player. We want to set the key in this `playerMap` entry to be the player's name, and then we want to create an array with the four PER values for that player to be the value.

```javascript
        // Add the player and their stats to the player map variable.
        playerMap.set(playerName, [playerPER0, playerPER12, playerPER24, playerPER36]);
    }
```

When we have all our player data in a map, we can start adding our players to our web app so that they're ready for the coach to put them in the game. 

```javascript
    // Add the players to the bench.
    addPlayersToGame();
```

In summary, our entire `processPlayers` function should look like this code:

```javascript
// Function to read in all player stats.
function processPlayers(allPlayerStats) {
    // Split the data by newline into an array.
    var allPlayerStatLines = allPlayerStats.split(/\r\n|\n/);

    // Loop through the 16 players and create a map entry of player name to player stats.
    for (var playerIndex=1; playerIndex <= numPlayers; playerIndex++) {

        // Create variables to represent the four rows for each player's stats throughout the game.
        var playerLine0 = allPlayerStatLines[playerIndex].split(',');
        var playerLine12 = allPlayerStatLines[playerIndex+numPlayers].split(',');
        var playerLine24 = allPlayerStatLines[playerIndex+(numPlayers*2)].split(',');
        var playerLine36 = allPlayerStatLines[playerIndex+(numPlayers*3)].split(',');

        // Create variables to represent the player name, PER for each time period.
        var playerName = playerLine0[1];
        var playerPER0 = parseFloat(playerLine0[perIndex].substring(0,5));
        var playerPER12 = parseFloat(playerLine12[perIndex].substring(0,5));
        var playerPER24 = parseFloat(playerLine24[perIndex].substring(0,5));
        var playerPER36 = parseFloat(playerLine36[perIndex].substring(0,5));
        
        // Add the player and their stats to the player map variable.
        playerMap.set(playerName, [playerPER0, playerPER12, playerPER24, playerPER36]);
    }

    // Add the players to the bench.
    addPlayersToGame();
}
```
