# Summary

[Space Jam: A New Legacy](https://spacejam.com) inspires us to see how we can combine passions and challenges in our lives with technical skills to create new opportunities for improvement and discover. LeBron has dedicated a significant amount of his life to practicing, learning, and perservering through basketball challenges, but he also identifies ways that his passion for the sport can impact the world around him. We can do the same. This module introduces you to Python coding for machine learning *and* JavaScript coding for web app development. With the skills you have begun to learn here, you can begin to explore other ways to impact the world and people around you.

Throughout this module you taken previously cleansed basketball data related to Looney Tunes characters and trained a machine learning model to create a sample dataset of PER values for 16 characters based on the standard deviation of their statistics. You then took the generated dataset and created a web app that could be used between each quarter to optimize the PER of hte players on the court to hopefully optimize the coaches chances of winning the game!

You can continue exploring how to integrate Azure Static Web Apps and machine learning to create support applications for sports coaches, here are just a few ideas:
- Sort the player cards based on the PER stat for that function
- Write an algorithm to determine the best lineup for each quarter
- Deploy your machine learning model and call it dynamically from within the web app
- Create game events that could impact PER throughout the gameplay

We encourage you to make this app your own and use it as a place to test your creativity, determination, and skills. 

Remember, this module is a part of a multi-modal approach to learning, which means that you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr G video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/SpaceJam).
