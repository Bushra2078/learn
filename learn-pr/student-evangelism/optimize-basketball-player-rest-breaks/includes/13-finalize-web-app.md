The final function is the one that will simulate the game actually running. In this case, instead of waiting 12 minutes, we'll pretend that a quarter is only 12 seconds. 

The `startNextQuarter()` function is called from the button that is defined in *index.html*. Locate the `div` that has the ID `start` to see the `onclick` declaration. 

```javascript
// This function is called when the Game button is clicked. Each time the button is clicked
// it will run through a 12-second timer (simulating 12 minutes) and then update the game
// to the next quarter
function startNextQuarter() {
    // If there aren't exactly 5 players on the court, alert the coach that the game can't start
    if(playersOnCourt != maxPlayersOnCourt){
        alert("Choose exactly " + maxPlayersOnCourt + " players to be on the court.");
        return;
    }

    document.getElementById("start").innerHTML = "Q" + (currentQuarter+1) + " is in progress";

    // Define the interval period for the quarter, in this case, 12 seconds
    var interval = secondsInQuarter;

    // Set the quarterInplay variable to true so that the coach can't move players during
    // gameplay
    quarterInPlay = true;

    // Update the count down every 1 second, as indicated by the `1000` as the second parameter
    // to the setInterval function
    var x = setInterval(function() {        
        // Display the current time on the court board
        document.getElementById("timer").innerHTML = "Q "+ (currentQuarter+1) + " Timer: " + ((secondsInQuarter - interval)+1);

        // Decrement the interval counter for this quarter
        interval--;

        // If the quarter has ended, reset the interval timer, and get ready for the next quarter
        if (interval < 0) {
            clearInterval(x);
            if(currentQuarter < 3) {
                endQuarter();
            }
            else {
                endGame();
            }
        }
    }, 1000);
}
```

Although the interval functionality is beyond the scope of this module, a critical piece (especially when you're testing new functionality) is that you can modify the interval timing, which is the second parameter in the `setInterval()` function; in this case, it's set to 1000. You can set this to 100 if you want the quarters to go by quicker to more quickly test new changes.

## Test your new app

It's finally time! The app is finished! Now, we can test our app. Remember that you'll want to test all the functionality (including trying to add too many players to the court, or starting the game when there are too few players on the court).

1. Choose 5 characters.
2. Press the **Start the Game!** button.
3. When the timer stops, adjust (or not) the players on the court versus players taking a break.
4. When your lineup is locked in, selects the **Start Q2** button.

Repeat steps 3 and 4 this for all four quarters, and you should get to the end of the game!

Congratulations! You finished your web app!

## Deploy your final web app

Now that you have finished your web app and you were able to test it locally, you can deploy it to the web! This is actually fairly easy. All you have to do is push your changes to your main branch! 

To commit and push your changes, go to the source control extension, add a commit mesage, and select the check mark at the top. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/commit-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows committing main.js changes.":::

Next, push your changes: select the up and down arrows at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window (be sure that you're on the main branch).

:::image type="content" source="../media/push-changes.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows pushing main.js changes.":::

After you commit and push your changes (and wait a little while for the GitHub Action to be triggered and completed), you can go back to the Azure extension, right-click the production app, and then select **Browse Site**.
