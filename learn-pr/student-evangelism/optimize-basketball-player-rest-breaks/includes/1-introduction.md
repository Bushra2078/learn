*Welcome to the Jam! Basketball champion and cultural icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless Tune Bugs Bunny with the animated/live-action event "Space Jam: A New Legacy," from director Malcolm D. Lee and an innovative filmmaking team including Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter. This transformational journey is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of basketball stars as you’ve never seen them before. It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even "King" James by playing the game their own way.*  

Inspired by the film, this Microsoft Learn module explores how data can play a big role in athletic games, specifically in basketball. If you're a sports fan, you know that coaches do more than watch what's happening in the moment of each game. Coaches use what they know about their team and players, what they know about the other team and players, *and* what's happening on a higher level throughout the season to make every decision during a game.

In the middle of Game 1 of the finals, should the coach continue to play LeBron James when the team is up by 10 points? Or should the coach give LeBron James a rest, so he can remain strong for future games? Although coaches have years of experience and gathering data to help them make in-the-moment decisions, we can see how data and a bit of coding might be of use to a coach in the heat of the game. 

Furthermore, we can start to experiment with how data can help inform a more novice coach with a not-so-typical team. In *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, we see a team of Tune Squad players that each have unique skills they bring to the court. Even a professional basketball coach probably won't be able to predict how well each player might do!

In this module, you'll use the data that was cleansed and manipulated in the preceding module of this *Space Jam: A New Legacy*-inspired learning path to create an app for the Tune Squad's coach to use during an All Tune Squad game. This app will help the coach determine which player should sit out for a short water break. Your goal: To optimize the chances of the Tune Squad winning their game!
