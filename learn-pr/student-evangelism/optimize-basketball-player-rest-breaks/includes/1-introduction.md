Welcome to the Jam!  NBA champion and cultural icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless Tune Bugs Bunny with the animated/live-action event “Space Jam: A New Legacy,” from director Malcolm D. Lee and an innovative filmmaking team including Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.  This transformational journey is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of NBA and WNBA stars as you’ve never seen them before.  It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even “King” James by playing the game their own way.  

Inspired by the film, this module explores how data can play a big role during athletic games, specifically basketball. If you're a sports fan, you know that the coaches are doing more than watching what is happening in the moment of each game. They are using what they know about their team and players, and what they know about the other team and players, AND what is happening larger within the season, to make every decision as the game goes on. 

In the middle of Game 1 of the finals, should the coach continue to play LeBron James when the team is up by 10 points? Or should he give him a rest so that he can remain strong for future games? While coaches have years of experience and data gathering to help them make in-the-moment decisions, we can also see how data and a bit of coding *could* be of use to a coach in the heat of a game. 

Furthermore, we can start to experiment with how data can help inform a more novice coach with a not-so-typical team. In *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, we see a team of Tune Squad players that each have unique skills they bring to the court that even a professional basketball coach might probably not be able to predict how well each player might do!

Through this module, you will use the data that was cleansed and manipulated as part of the previous module in this Space Jam: A New Legacy inspired learning path to create an app for the Tune Squad's coach to use during an All Tune Squad game. This app will help the coach determine which player should sit out for a short water break. Your goal: To optimize the chances of the Tune Squad winning their game!

This module is part of a multi-modal approach to learning, which means that you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr G Learn TV video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/Basketball/Videos?azure-portal=true).
