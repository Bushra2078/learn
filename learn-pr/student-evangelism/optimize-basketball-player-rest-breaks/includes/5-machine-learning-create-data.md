We've now run into a problem. There is no way for us to watch a game of 16 Looney Tunes characters playing basketball to be able to test out our model in an actual app. There is no way for us to get real-time game data from the Looney Tunes playing. BUT, we *can* use the trick we learned to test our model to create a new dataset that would simulate a game!

The web app that we will build in the upcoming units will facilitate us decising which player to give a water break to every 12 minutes of a standard 48-minute game. So we should create a CSV file that will contain randomized player data over four iterations: 0 minutes (the start of the game), 12 mintues, 24 minutes, and 36 minutes.

```python
# Initialize four empty DataFrames, one for each 12-minute period.
number_of_iterations = 4
df_list = [pd.DataFrame(columns=game_stat_cols, index=list(lt_df['player_name'])) for i in range(number_of_iterations)]

# For each period, generate randomized player data and predict the PER.
# Use the model fitted earlier.
for df in df_list:
    for stat in game_stat_cols:
        df[stat] = list(lt_df[stat] + randn(len(lt_df)) * stdev_s[stat])
    df['PER'] = lin_reg.predict(df)

# Concatenate the DataFrames and make the players' names the index.
game_df = pd.concat(df_list)
game_df.rename_axis('player_name', inplace=True)

# Now create another index for the period in quesiton.
minutes = [(x // len(lt_df)) * 12 for x in range(len(game_df))]
game_df['minutes'] = minutes
game_df.set_index('minutes', append=True, inplace=True)
game_df = game_df.swaplevel()

game_df
```

The final DataFrame looks complete, so we can save it as a CSV file so that we can use it in our web app. When saving this DataFrame as a CSV file, we will want to keep the indices since we made them the player's names.

```python
# Export the finished DataFrame to CSV. (Be sure to retain the indices!)
game_df.to_csv('game_stats.csv')
```

A new CSV file should appear in your Visual Studio Code folder:
