Node.js Web APIs enables all your applications to be reachable by anyone using a browser or HTTP capable client software. The various routes available in your API enable additional capabilities for these users.

In this module, you are a developer for an online retailer. The retailer is building a new set of HTTP APIs for their application. The application is built on Node.js. Your job is to build an API that lists the products they sell. The API you build lets applications work with the product data.

While Node.js has some core capabilities via the HTTP module to create an API there are many web frameworks that simplify this setup. In particular Express is used by many developers and has been around for a long time. It enables you to focus on creating the necessary routes to support your applications.

In this module, you'll learn how to create API routes with Node.js and Express using JavaScript. You'll also learn about the parts of URLs, the components of a route and how they work.
