You started this module by learning what makes up a URL and how routes play a part in a URL. You also gained an understanding of the possible components of a route.

You learned how Express simplifies the creation of API routes to support expanding the capabilities that you want to offer to users. You can configure route creation even further with the use of HTTP verbs like GET and POST. You can also take advantage of route and query parameters.

At this point, you should have a good understanding of how to add new routes to your Node.js APIs built with Express by using JavaScript.
