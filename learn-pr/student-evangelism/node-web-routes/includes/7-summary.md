You started by learning what makes up a URL and how routes play a part in them. You also gained an understanding of the possible components that can make up a route.

You learned how Express simplifies the creation of API routes to support expanding the capabilities you want to offer to users. This can be configured even further with usage of HTTP verbs like GET and POST. It's also made possible by leveraging route and query parameters.

At this point, you should have a good understanding of how to add new routes to your Node.js APIs built with Express using JavaScript.
