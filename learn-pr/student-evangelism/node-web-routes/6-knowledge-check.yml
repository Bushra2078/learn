  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: How would you set up Express to handle a post request with JSON data?
      choices:
        - content: Call app.use(bodyParser.json()) at the top, register a route by using
            the post method as in app.post(<route>, () =>{}), read from req.body
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Register a route by using the post method as in app.post(<route>, ()
            =>{}), read from req.body
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: You need to configure a body paring middleware or the posted data
            won't be available on req.body.
        - content: Configure body parsing middleware, register a route by using the post
            method as in app.post(<route>, () =>{}), read from req.data
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The posted data is available on req.body, not req.data.
        - content: "Call app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })) at the top,
            register a route by using the post method as in app.post(<route>, ()
            =>{}), read from req.body"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The configuration at the top is wrong. That configuration will
            instruct it to receive posted data from a form that is URL encoded.
            It needs to be app.use(bodyParser.json()).
