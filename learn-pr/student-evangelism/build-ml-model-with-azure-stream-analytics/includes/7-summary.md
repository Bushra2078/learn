In this module, you built a polar bear tracking solution that uploads images from a simulated array of cameras to Azure Blob Storage. The polar bear tracking solution uses Azure Functions to trigger a function app each time an image is uploaded. Then, it analyzes the images for polar bears by using the Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision service. Finally, it visualizes the output by using Power BI. You also got first-hand experience using Azure SQL Database. It's a sophisticated solution, and one that has applications in the real world.
