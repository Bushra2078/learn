In this module, you built a polar bear tracking solution that uploads images from a simulated array of cameras to Azure Blob Storage, triggers an Azure Function each time an image is uploaded, analyzes the images for polar bears using the Custom Vision Service, and visualizes the output using Microsoft Power BI. You also got first-hand experience using Azure SQL Database. It's a sophisticated solution, and one that has applications in the real world.
