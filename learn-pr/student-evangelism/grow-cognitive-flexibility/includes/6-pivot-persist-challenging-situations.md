Now that you’ve examined the importance of enhancing cognitive flexibility when people are learning, you want to explore additional strategies to help your workshop participants pivot and persist in challenging situations.

## Explore strategies to pivot and persist

Challenging situations are common in workplace or educational environments. This is especially true of the tech space.

Have you ever felt like quitting a course or a project partway through because you felt like a failure or just didn’t get it? Or have you wondered exactly how should you get started?

One of the best ways to become more cognitively flexible is to expose yourself to new experiences and ways of doing things. If you’re not sure where to start, the following table has a few steps that you can take.

| **Step** | **Description** | **Example** |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stop | Pause to reflect on the challenge. | How can I revisit my understanding of the problem? |
| Link | Make connections between various angles of the situation. | Is the current problem related to any other knowledge gaps? Are there any other skills that I can leverage to overcome this challenge? |
| Think | Visualize new possibilities and consider alternatives. | What are my assumptions about this challenge? Can I think of an alternative solution or method of solving the problem? |
| Act | Formulate a new plan. | What will be my new approach? What can I do differently from before? |

### Pivot rather than panic in the face of difficulty

Each person has their own unique way of reacting to a problem. Some might get stuck when attempting to solve a problem. If you are helping a person who seems stuck, try to give them a few moments before nudging with them with a tip. Encourage them to ask for clarification on the problem given to them. You can ask them to articulate their thought process to help clarify where they’re stuck. Additionally, they can benefit greatly by collaborating with others and by brainstorming new ideas.

### Common reactions to setbacks

How do you react when you’re faced with a setback or disruption? Explore the following different reactions to an unexpected setback, and then examine how open you are to stretching beyond your comfort zone:

- I find it difficult to abandon an approach even when it’s clearly not working for me.

- If one door closes, I try to find another door or a window.

- I take time to reflect and pull out the useful information from negative feedback so I can move forward.

- I’m likely to give up if an expert tells me that I'm not cut out for a task.

- I’m open to change.

- I like to explore new perspectives.

- I have a set list of things I know how to do, and I can't do anything new.

- I ask for help from someone else without specifying how the person can help.

- I spend more time rehashing an exchange with difficult feedback rather than revising my work.

Do any of the preceding reactions to an unexpected obstacle feel familiar to you? Which of these reactions indicate a higher level of cognitive flexibility in a person? Do you seek feedback from others? Do you have a strategy for unpacking the feedback?

## Scenarios and strategies

What kind of situations might you face where cognitive flexibility can be a useful tool? The following list illustrates some example scenarios that you or your participants might encounter in the tech industry:

- Recovering from a situation when your mind goes blank during an interview or conversation

- Knowing how to respond when your supervisor or instructor questions your work from an angle you know nothing about

- Adapting during a presentation when the tech fails

- Pivoting on a plan when your team faces a setback on a group project

- Knowing how to reset when your teams’ motivation is declining

- Asking for clarifying feedback from an instructor, supervisor, or peer when the feedback isn’t specific or clear

- Resetting expectations when it’s clear you volunteered for something you can no longer commit to

Here are some strategies that you and your participants can use to enhance cognitive flexibility:

- Ask questions to clarify your doubts about the problem.

- Adapt your approach and be ready to change your approach when new information suggests you should do so.

- View challenges as opportunities.

- Welcome new ideas and opinions—even if they seem quite different at first.

- Respond to criticism positively and not by reacting in a defensive manner.

- Orient your goals to broaden your knowledge, experience, and skill set.

- Seek other people’s opinions and feedback.

- Question your own long-standing assumptions and encourage others to question theirs.

- Objectively analyze situations—evaluate the pros, cons, and implications of different courses of action.

- Analyze a wide variety of options, visualize new possibilities, and formulate fresh approaches.

- Identify patterns across unrelated events and information.
