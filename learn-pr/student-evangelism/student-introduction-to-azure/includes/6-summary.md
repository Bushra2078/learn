In this module, we looked at Azure, several tools and learning platforms. Azure is a cloud platform by Microsoft where you can host your apps but also integrate your apps with a multitude of APIs, giving your apps added capabilities like AI for example. By using Azure, there’s a lot of concerns you no longer need to manage compared to hosting your apps locally, also called “on-premises”. Some concerns Azure handles for you are scaling, backup and analytics. 

GitHub is a hosted platform where you can use the code revision tool Git. By using GitHub, you can collaborate on projects as a student and going forward in your work life.  

Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment (IDE). What makes Visual Studio Code a great tool to use is that it’s free, it integrates well with Git and GitHub, and it offers a large ecosystem of extensions enhancing its capabilities.  

We also looked at Microsoft Learn, a free platform containing more than 3000 modules that teach a wide variety of skills from Azure, Microsoft tools, app building, Data Science, AI and much more. Additionally, Microsoft Learn is gamified to give you points upon completing modules, gather trophies and allows you to track progress as you learn.
