When it comes to developing apps, regardless of if your domain is data science, web development or something else, there are several problems you need to solve. An example of these problems is how you get your app in front of users and how you ensure the app serves everything from a few users to millions.

Additionally, you want "best-in-class" security and you also want to be able to monitor the health of your app. You can solve all of these challenges with your own servers and your own software, also called "on-premises" services, but itâ€™s costly and takes many people to manage. Using the cloud addresses most of these issues so you can focus your efforts on developing new features over spending time on configuration and other concerns.

However, as a student, you're trying to understand how you can get started with cloud computing using Microsoft Azure and modern technology to help you solve problems. There are many aspects to Azure that makes it interesting to use, things like automated backup, seamless scaling and being able to easily add AI to your apps, for example. In this module, we'll look at Microsoft Azure and try to understand it at a high level.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn to:

    - Distinguish core concepts of cloud computing. 
    - Understand what Azure can be used for by exploring some common scenarios. 
    - Identify some tools and services that can help you get started with Azure.

This module helps you understand some core concepts of cloud computing, Azure and what to use it for.
