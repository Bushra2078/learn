As a student, you may be interested in learning how to get started with cloud computing using Microsoft Azure and modern technology to help you solve problems. Azure offers a range of features that make it an attractive option, including automated backup, seamless scaling, and the ability to easily integrate AI into your apps.

When it comes to app development, whether it be in the field of data science, web development, or any other domain, there are several challenges that must be addressed. One such challenge is ensuring that your app reaches a wide audience while maintaining optimal performance, regardless of whether it is serving a few users or millions.

Additionally, you want "best-in-class" security and you also want to be able to monitor the health of your app. You can solve all of these challenges with your own "on-premises" servers and your own software, but itâ€™s costly and takes many people to manage. Using the cloud addresses most of these issues so you can focus your efforts on developing new features instead of spending time on configuration and other concerns. In this module, we will explore Microsoft Azure and gain a high-level understanding of its capabilities.
