When it comes to developing apps, regardless of it your domain is Data Science or web development or something else, there are several problems you need to solve. An example of these problems is how you get your app in front of users, how you ensure the app can serve everything from a few users to millions.  

Additionally, you want to have “best in class” security, and you also want to monitor the health of your app. You can solve all of the above-mentioned challenges with your own servers and your own software, also called “on prem” but it’s usually costly and takes a lot of people to manage.  

The cloud is what addresses most of the above scenarios so you can focus your efforts on developing new features over spending time on configuration and other concerns.

In this module, we will look at Azure and try to understand it at a high level.
