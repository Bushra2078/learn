In this unit, you are introduced to the concept of cloud computing and its platform, Azure. You'll also learn about the core services provided by Microsoft Azure.

## Cloud computing

What comes to your mind when you hear the term cloud computing? It sounds complex or complicated, right?

Let’s try to make it less complicated by looking at it from a high level and hopefully you'll learn that it's not as complex as you thought.

Cloud computing is a technology that allows you to access and use computer resources (like software, storage, and processing power) over the internet without needing to own or physically manage those resources yourself.  

### The cloud

Think of the cloud as a library where you can borrow books whenever you need them, without buying or storing them in your own house. In the same way, with cloud computing, you can use the computing resources you need when you need them without having to own and maintain the hardware and software yourself. It makes computing easy, flexible, and often less expensive.

So, what is the cloud? In short, it’s a collection of gigantic datacenters spread out across the globe. Each datacenter consists of thousands of connected servers that can run any kind of operating system and app you can think of.

## Azure

Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform consisting of more than 200 services and products. It covers a range of different topics from AI, app development, data science, machine learning, storage and much more.  

With Azure, you can "save the day" for individuals and organizations all around the globe. Azure can help businesses manage their finances, assist healthcare providers in delivering top-quality patient care, or power online gaming platforms. Basically, you can solve it all with Azure.

### Benefits of using Azure

There are many benefits to using the cloud, and Azure in particular. For example:

- **Disaster recovery:** Natural disasters can halt operations for weeks. Think of [datacenters damaged as a result of hurricane Sandy in 2012](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/11/01/ny-data-centers-battle-back-from-storm-damage). Storing your apps in the cloud means that they’re not tied to a specific datacenter and your app can exist as copies in different parts of the world.
- **Security:** Security is something you likely don't want to write yourself and shouldn't as it's easy to miss a specific use case. To ensure the safety of your customers and their data, use best-in-class security services provided by a cloud operator like Azure.
- **Scaling:** Imagine you’re running an e-commerce business on-premises. In such a business, you need to plan for holidays and other periods where you expect extra traffic to your site. You might have servers on standby or you might buy extra servers just for this period. But when the busy period is over, you end up powering down servers and maybe put them in storage. With the cloud, you have seamless scaling without waste. The cloud can perform "horizontal scaling" to scale to the number of servers you need for your site at any given time. You can also configure your services so that your servers have more CPU and memory or other improved hardware specifications, this type of scaling is known as "vertical scaling".

In short, Azure offers multiple benefits that make it easy for you to invent with purpose.

## Scenario: Building a college project is easy with Azure

Now that you know more about the cloud and Azure, let’s have a look at how you can use Azure where you are now, in school.

Imagine you're building a college project. With Azure, you have everything you need to make your project a success:

- Azure provides computing power. You can run the backend of your apps or perform tasks without managing the hardware.

- Azure offers storage space, like a backpack that can hold all of your project materials. You can store project files, data, and images in the cloud, which means you can access them from anywhere that has an internet connection.

- Azure offers development tools, like a toolbox full of cool gadgets. You can use these tools for your project to build, secure and host web apps, mobile apps, and even chatbots!

Azure also offers a bunch of useful tools for data analytics and machine learning that can help you find patterns in your data. You can use these tools to build intelligent applications that can make predictions or detect anomalies in your data.

With its computing power, storage space, development tools, and machine learning capabilities, you can invent with purpose and create amazing projects that will blow everyone's mind!

## Microsoft Learn

Microsoft Learn, aka.ms/learn, is a learning platform that’s free to use and currently consists of a wide variety of topics presented in training modules. Each module takes you through concepts, and in many cases exercises that allow you to practice the concepts you were taught. Microsoft Learn is an extensive library of interactive courses and hands-on learning experiences, empowering you to master new technical skills at your own pace.

### Gamification

To make your learning fun, Microsoft Learn has a gamification system, meaning that you get points for each completed module or completed path, which are groups of training modules on a specific topic.  

You can also keep track of your progress via your profile. There you can find information on your module learning progress, achievements, cloud skill challenges you can participate in and much more.

### Scenario: Learn Python

:::image type="content" source="../media/python-module.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a module in the Python for beginners learning path.":::

To be an app developer, you typically need skills in at least one programming language. Python is a great choice of language to learn as it can be used for all sorts of purposes like data science, app development, IoT and more. In this path, you’ll be taken through the fundamentals of the language to more advanced topics like working with Python in a Notebook, managing many files and dependencies as part of a project, and more!
