    choices:
    - content: "Your special \"home\" directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Recall that `~` refers to your special \"home\" directory - not `.`"
    - content: "The parent directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Recall that `..` refers to the parent directory in Bash"
    - content: "The first alphabetical subdirectory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`.` is a short-version of a directory name, but not that one."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Remember that `.` refers to your current directory. Changing directories (`cd`) to your current directory wouldn't change directories at all!"
