In this module, you learned how to create a health bot by using the *triage and handoff* scenario template. Scenario templates are the best place to start if you have a new Azure Health Bot instance. Templates also help you learn how to build your own custom Health Bot scenarios. With a template, you can review the scenario logic to understand how it was built.
