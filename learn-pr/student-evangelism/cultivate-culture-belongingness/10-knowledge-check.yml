    - content: 'Ask them if they know how to use a tool which is difficult to use to assess whether they belong in tech or not.'

  - content: 'What casual exchange causes a sense of subordination in the recipient?'
    choices:
    - content: 'A chilly climate'
      isCorrect: false

    choices:
    - content: 'Invite others to participate, be open to different perspectives, practice active listening, and share the air.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. These are four steps you can take to build an inclusive environment.'
    - content: 'Practice giving advice to coworkers, have regular meetings about office inclusivity policies, put up motivational posters, and send out weekly emails with ideas for meeting topics on inclusivity.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Those might all be good things to do, but they are not the four steps to build an inclusive environment.'
    - content: 'Follow anti-discrimination legislation, have regular meetings about inclusivity and the law, communicate the anti-discrimination policy to staff, and keep the office at a comfortable temperature.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Although legislation and communication about anti-discrimination are important, in this case “inclusive environment” means people feel welcomed into the space, and feel respected, heard, and valued.'
