In this exercise, you'll evaluate a set of situations. The idea is for you to consider each situation, and then decide if it's something you do often or seldom.

## Assess your belongingness

Reflect on the following situations. For each one, decide if you do these things frequently, occasionally, or never. Optionally, note your answers on a device or on paper.

|Situation  |Frequently  |Occasionally  |Never  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| I get overwhelmed and procrastinate when choosing a tech tool.     |         |         |         |
| I ask a trusted source with expertise for tech help.     |         |         |         |
| I wonder if becoming a tech person is for me.     |         |         |         |
| I post a question on a tech forum.     |         |         |         |
| I get excited to try out a bunch of new tech tools.     |         |         |         |
| I enter a classroom and feel I can choose any seat.     |         |         |         |
| I avoid asking questions so that I seem like I know what I'm doing.     |         |         |         |
| I wonder if I can connect with other tech people.     |         |         |         |
| I think of myself as a tech "newbie."     |         |         |         |
| I offer to help the person next to me when I realize they're struggling.     |         |         |         |
