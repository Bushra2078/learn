In this exercise, you will evaluate a set of situations. The idea is to make you reflect and decide if these things is something you do often or less seldom.

## Assess your belongingness

Reflect on the following situations. Decide for each if you would do these things “frequently,” “occasionally,” or “never.” Optionally, note your answers on a device or on paper.

|Situation  |Frequently  |Occasionally  |Never  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Get overwhelmed when choosing a tech tool and procrastinate.     |         |         |         |
| Ask a trusted source with expertise for tech help.     |         |         |         |
| Wonder if becoming a tech person is for me.     |         |         |         |
| Post a question on a tech forum.     |         |         |         |
| Get excited to try out a bunch of new tech tools.     |         |         |         |
| Enter a classroom and feel I can choose any seat.     |         |         |         |
| Avoid asking questions so that I seem like I know what I’m doing.     |         |         |         |
| Wonder if I can connect with other tech people.     |         |         |         |
| Think of myself as a tech “newbie.”     |         |         |         |
| Offer to help the person next to me when I realize they’re struggling.     |         |         |         |
