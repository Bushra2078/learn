Cultivate a climate of belongingness in the technology sector (tech) by proactively including and welcoming people with diverse backgrounds and lived experiences. Be aware of how your biases, words, and actions affect feelings of belonging in others.

In this module, you will:

- Explore what belonging is and why it matters.
- Discover how to recognize belonging in yourself and others.

## Scenario: you're a team lead on a development team

Imagine you're a team lead on a development team that's building a website application. The team is a mix of new and experienced developers who have a wide range of skills and backgrounds. The beta website version is due soon and the project is behind schedule. Private conversations with your team members reveal that many of them are unhappy. They don't feel like they belong because the culture of the team doesn't create a sense of belongingness. The reasons for their unhappiness vary. For example, some feel their ideas aren't being taken seriously, while others have received dismissive comments from team members.

You recognize that to get the best performance from the team, everyone needs to feel comfortable  participating fully and openly. To encourage this shift, the team needs to have a climate of belonging.
