You and the members of your team now understand that for everyone in the team to participate fully and openly in a culture of tech, the team needs to cultivate a sense of belonging. You've begun to raise your awareness of your subconscious biases, the messages you're sending when you interact with others, and how you contribute to others' sense of belonging.

To move toward changing the climate in your team to one of belongingness, your team has begun to proactively take steps to ensure that everyone in your team — regardless of their perspective, background, or lived experience — is welcomed, included, respected, and valued.

The project is getting back on track. Team members are cooperating and communicating better. Overall, you can tell that the team members are making genuine efforts to contribute to a culture of inclusion and belongingness in the team.
