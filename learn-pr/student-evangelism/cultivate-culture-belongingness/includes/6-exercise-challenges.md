In this exercise, you'll reflect on some statements. If you find yourself thinking 'yes' to any of the questions, then it's a good indicator that it might affect your behavior in the workplace towards others.

## Reflect on your own assumptions of who should be in tech

Whether hidden or overt, your biases and assumptions can direct your actions, thoughts, and feelings towards others.

- Can you think of a time when you made an assumption about your ability to succeed because you either did or didn't think of yourself as a "tech person"?

- Have you ever made an assumption about someone else's ability to succeed in tech?

- Did you ever find out that your first impressions of a person's aptitude in tech were incorrect, and that they were more or less competent than your assumptions led you to believe?

## Reflect on inclusiveness in computer science

Reflect on the following questions that pertain to diversity in tech. Optionally, note your answers on a device or on paper.

- Describe different types of diversity, and why diversity of any kind can make a difference to the field.

- What value does diversity add to computer science as a field?

- 'What is the cost or benefit to the field if computer science doesn't improve its diversity'? Why isn't the status quo advantageous?

- What are some barriers to diversity in computer science? What kinds of initiatives are being developed to address these barriers?

- In your assessment, what are the strengths and limitations of different initiatives? And why?
