### Collaborate in open-source projects that interest you

By participating in open-source software (OSS) development, you can have a direct impact on interesting projects as you sharpen your technical skills. In this scenario, networking occurs naturally through comments, fixes, and interactions with others who are immersed in the same project. When you work on OSS projects, you come virtually shoulder-to-shoulder with both experienced and inexperienced peers from all over the world, each bringing a unique point of view to the project.  

Some GitHub projects include discussion boards where you can meet peers and connect online.  

### Participate in hackathons

Hackathons are reliable opportunities to network with peers and meet representatives of interesting companies. During a hackathon, you form a team around a cause or solution and then build a software-based project over a set period of time.

In doing so, you also get access to resources and connections provided by the organizing teams, which tend to include the sponsoring companies' employees.

Your conversations might even lead to an interview or an invitation to apply for a job.
