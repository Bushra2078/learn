Networking is one of the most important factors in starting your career, yet it is often overlooked, particularly as you are starting your career. Networking encompasses an array of elements that can be helpful in advancing your career. These elements not only provide opportunities for you to grow and learn, but also increase your skills in communication and teamwork.  

There are many types of networking that all provide both personal and career growth. Here are some things you can do to network:

- Discuss topics with your peers.
  - Find a mentor by joining a mentorship program.
- Join and attend organizational meetings.
- Become part of your school's clubs.
- Attend tutoring sessions and workshops.
- Participate in a hackathon and build something you’re passionate about.
- Contribute to open-source software.
  - Join an interest group or play a sport with other people.



## Is networking reserved to only in-person situations?

Not at all! Connecting with others via online interactions is also a form of networking. Asking or answering questions on forums and collaborating in websites such as GitHub or in other types of open-source projects provide the same opportunities of learning and professional growth as any in-person situations. Another great site where you can connect with people is LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a great online platform to build your professional network, thoughtfully engage with your peers, and learn new skills.

## How can I get started in networking?

There are multiple ways to get started with networking. Here are some ideas to get started.

### Join a Student Organization

Student organizations provide one of the best opportunities for networking. The members of these organizations can interact with you as peers and will most likely share common interests with you. With that in mind, connecting with them and learning about their experiences while also sharing your own is a great first step in networking. In addition to joining a student organization, participating and collaborating in such an organization will promote the development of incredibly valuable human skills such as communication, time management, and teamwork through events and socials such as service projects, excursions, and hackathons.

### Collaborate in open-source projects that interest you

Participating in open-source development, or OSS, allows you to have a direct impact on interesting projects while honing your technical skills. In this scenario, networking occurs with comments, fixes, and interactions with others who are also working on the same project. By working on these OSS projects you learn from both experienced and inexperienced peers, from different parts of the world and have a chance to experience different points of view.  Some GitHub projects include discussion boards where you can meet peers and connect online.  

### Participate in Hackathons

Hackathons are a reliable opportunity to network with your peers and meet representatives of interesting companies. During a hackathon, you form a team around a cause or solution and then build a software-based project over a set period of time. Eventually you will be able to showcase your skills and participate in challenges posted by the hackathon hosts. In doing so, you also get access to resources and connections provided by the organizing team, which tend to include sponsoring companies' employees. This way, you can both ask questions about these companies and share a bit of your story and interests. Your conversations may lead to an interview or an invitation to apply for a job.
