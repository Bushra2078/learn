Networking is one of the most important factors in starting your career, yet it is often overlooked. Networking encompasses an array of elements that can be helpful in advancing your career. These elements not only provide opportunities for you to grow and learn, but also to help improve your skills in communication and teamwork.  

Networking has many aspects, each serving to provide both personal and career growth. Here are a few ways to begin engaging in networking:

- Discuss topics with your peers.
- Find a mentor by joining a mentorship program.
- Join and attend organizational meetings.
- Become part of your school's clubs.
- Attend tutoring sessions and workshops.
- Participate in a hackathon, and build something you're passionate about.
- Contribute to open-source software.
- Join an interest group, or play a sport with other people.

## Is networking only for in-person situations?

Not at all! Connecting with others online is a well established and very common way to network. For example, try asking or answering questions on forums or collaborating on websites, such as GitHub, or on other types of open-source projects. These virtual activities provide the same learning and professional growth opportunities as any in-person activities.

There are multiple ways to get started with networking. The following sections present just a sampling of ideas.

### Join a student organization

Student organizations provide some of the best opportunities for networking. Their members can interact with you as peers and will most likely share common interests with you. Connecting with them and learning about their experiences while also sharing your own is a great first step in networking. 

Participating and collaborating in student organizations will help you develop incredibly valuable life skills, such as communication, time management, and teamwork, through service projects, excursions, hackathons, and other events.

> Joining a program such as Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors is a great idea when you are looking for networking opportunities with both professionals and other students. Learn more about the [Student Ambassadors program](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com).

### Collaborate in open-source projects that interest you

By participating in open-source software (OSS) development, you can have a direct impact on interesting projects as you sharpen your technical skills. In this scenario, networking occurs naturally through comments, fixes, and interactions with others who are immersed in the same project. When you work on OSS projects, you come virtually shoulder-to-shoulder with both experienced and inexperienced peers from all over the world, each bringing a unique point of view to the project.  

Some GitHub projects include discussion boards where you can meet peers and connect online.  

### Participate in hackathons

Hackathons are a reliable opportunity to network with your peers and meet representatives of interesting companies. During a hackathon, you form a team around a cause or solution and then build a software-based project over a set period of time. Eventually you'll be able to showcase your skills and participate in challenges posted by the hackathon hosts. In doing so, you also get access to resources and connections provided by the organizing team, which tend to include the sponsoring companies' employees. This way, you can both ask questions about these companies and share a bit of your story and interests. Who knows what will happen next? Your conversations might even lead to an interview or an invitation to apply for a job.
