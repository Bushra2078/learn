To build your resume, you'll need to separate it into sections. By organizing it in this way, you're following an agreed-upon standard that helps recruiters easily find and understand your educational background, work experience, and skills.

To start, ensure that your name and personal email address are clearly visible at the top. Next come the various sections that we'll cover in this unit. Your resume design is your personal choice, so we'll focus on how to divide each section and understand their contents.

## Sections

A student resume should include a minimum of three sections: 
* Education
* Skills
* Experience/Projects

There are other sections, such as Honors, Affiliations, and Organizations, that you can add if they're relevant, but recruiters ordinarily focus on scanning the first three sections. A professional resume will focus more on Skills and Experience than on Education. 

Let's go over how each section should be presented and what information must be included.

### Education

The Education section in a student resume is important because it lists not only your areas of study but also your anticipated *graduation date*. By including your anticipated graduation date, you give recruiters an idea of how far along you are in your coursework. The information you provide here can also determine the internships for which you qualify. Some companies host freshman and sophomore-year internships alongside the most common junior and senior-year internships. Depending on your graduation date, you could qualify for both.

Your Education section should include the following information:

* **What you are studying**: First and foremost, you must include the subject that you're studying, that is, the degree you're aiming to obtain. The title of the degree should be written left aligned, and it may be bolded, italicized, or capitalized as a way to distinguish it from the rest of the text.

* **Graduation date**: Next, focus on your expected graduation date. This date should be written on the right, most commonly next to the degree you're studying for, and specifying that it is an expected date rather than a completion date. For example, you might write,  "Expected: May 2021".

* **The program**: On the next line, specify your program of study, and just as you did for the expected graduation date, include where the program is located.

   If you've attended multiple colleges, there's usually no reason to include all of them. More often than not, listing your current school will suffice. However, if you have multiple degrees that might be applicable to a specific position, you should definitely include them. 

* **Coursework**: This last part should be a concise list of *related coursework*. Although this information is optional, it can help recruiters assess your level of knowledge. Most junior and senior year internships expect some courses to be in your repertoire, such as *Data Structures and Algorithms* for Computer Science students. Be sure to read the requirements for the position to which you're applying, and tailor your course list to match the knowledge that the position requires.

   As you're discussing your related coursework, include all courses that you consider representative of your technical knowledge. This is especially important if you don't have experience or relevant projects in one of the areas covered by a course that's required for the position.    

An example of a properly written education section might look like this:

> #### Education (section titles should have a larger font)
> 
> BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expected: May 2023
>  
> Learn University &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Redmond, WA
> 
> Related Coursework: Data Structures, Programming in C#, Algorithms, Web Development I

## Skills

This section is usually short, consisting of specific bullet points that assess your skills. In this section, you showcase your technical skills, carefully matching the required skills that are listed in the job posting. You'll want to list your skills as subgroups and ensure that they are related to one another. For example, programming languages should be grouped together.  

In addition to listing your skills, you'll want to match your description of proficiencies to that of the job posting. For example, if the job posting asks for years of experience, write your years of experience in the bullet points. However, if the posting asks for intermediate or beginner proficiency, write your skills in accordance to that format. This rule applies mainly to online applications, where your resume may be scanned for keywords to be considered. You'll find that matching and tailoring your resume to each application's keywords and requirements will make you stand out better.

A skills section should look similar to the following:

> #### Skills
> 
> Programming Languages: Intermediate proficiency in Python, C#, Java; beginner proficiency in Swift 
> 
> Software: Visual Studio, Anaconda, XCode, Azure PowerTools
> 
> Frameworks: ASP.NET, Django

> [!TIP]
> To help with organization and to reduce the amount of vertical space the information sometimes requires, you could also try formatting it in tables, like this:
>
> #### Skills
> | Programming Languages | Software | Frameworks |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | Intermediate proficiency in Python, C#, Java; beginner proficiency in Swift | Visual Studio, Anaconda, XCode, Azure PowerTools | ASP.NET, Django |
> | | |

## Experience and projects

This section is split into two parts to differentiate professional experience from projects. Depending on the type of professional experience you have, you'll want to place it before or after the Projects subsection. If your professional experience can be linked to the position you are applying to, the Experience subsection must appear first. If not, showcase your projects first. Highlighting the areas that can demonstrate your competencies will help recruiters to scan the information more easily.

The following guidelines can assist you in formatting both subsections:

* **Project**: Define the name or overall idea of your project, or your role in the case of experience, and write it left aligned on the first line. For example:

    > Calculator Class Project
    >
    > Learn University Gardening Club Member

* **Dates**: Similar to how you listed your anticipated graduation date, list the dates for both projects and positions. If these projects or positions are ongoing, write the starting date followed by "- Current". This information should be right aligned on the same line as the name/role.

* **Describe experience**: Following the title of your project/your role, add the bullet points that describe your experience. Doing so will incorporate the writings we described in the previous unit, under [Describe your experience](../4-resume-writing.yml). Following the examples used there, the two subsections should be similar to the following:

   >#### Projects
   >
   > Calculator Class Project - Example University  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; December 2020
   > 
   > - Ensured the correct functionality of a calculator program by identifying 15 bugs utilizing Python Exemption classes and debugging tools, implementing fixes and testing the program through 24 test cases
   >
   >#### Experience
   >
   > Learn University Gardening Club Member  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  June 2020 - Current
   > 
   > - Maintained the club's nursery by monitoring and caring for X different species of plants, in collaboration with X members

> [!TIP]
> Do not add periods at the end of your bullet points. It helps with the flow of reading and allows recruiters to read further without feeling the need to stop too often.
