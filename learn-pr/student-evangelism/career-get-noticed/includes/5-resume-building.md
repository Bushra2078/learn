To build your resume, you will need to separate it into sections. By having sections, you follow an agreed standard that will make it easier for the recruiter to understand things like your educational background, work experience, and, skills. 

First off, you must ensure that your name and personal email are clearly visible at the top. They are followed by the different sections that will be described in this unit. Resume design is personal choice, so we will focus on how to divide each section and understand their contents. 

## Sections

A student resume should include a minimum of three different sections: Education, Skills, and Experience/Projects. There are other sections such as Honors, Affiliations, and Organizations that can be added if deemed relevant, but recruiters will normally focus on scanning the first three sections. A professional resume will also require these sections with Skills and Experience taking a bigger focus over Education. Now let's go over how each section should be presented and what information must be included.

### Education

This section in a student resume is important as it lists not only your areas of study but your *graduation date*. Including your expected graduation date provides recruiters with an idea of how advanced you might be in your courses. It can also determine the internships for which you qualify. Some companies host freshman and sophomore year internships alongside the most common junior and senior year ones, and depending on your graduation date you could qualify for both. 

> How should you write your education section and what information should you include?

1. **What you are studying**. First and foremost you must include what you are studying, that is, the degree you are aiming to obtain. The title of the degree should be written left aligned, and it may be bolded, italicized, or capitalized as a way to highlight it from the rest of the text.

1. **Graduation date**. Next, focus on your expected graduation date. This date should be written on the right, most commonly next to the degree you are studying for, with a prefix that specifies that it is an expected date rather than a completion date. For example,  "Expected: May 2021".

1. **The program**. In the following line, specify your program of study, and just like you did for the expected graduation date, include where the program is located.

1. **Coursework**. The last part should be a concise list of *related coursework*. While optional, this list can help a recruiter assess your level of knowledge. Most junior and senior year internships expect some courses to be in your repertoire, like *Data Structures and Algorithms* for Computer Science students. Make sure to read the requirements for the position to which you are applying, and tailor your course list to match the knowledge that the position requires. 

An example of a properly written education section would look like this:

> Education (aim for a bigger font for section titles) 

> BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE                            Expected: May 2023 

> Learn University                                                          Redmond, WA 

> Related Coursework: Data Structures, Programming in C#, Algorithms, Web Development I

## Education FAQS

Q: If I have attended multiple colleges, should I include every single one of them in this section? 

A: Usually, no. More often than not, your current education will suffice. *However*, if you have multiple degrees in applicable for a specific position, you can definitely include them.  

Q: How many courses should I include in the related coursework? 

A: As many as you deem representative of your technical knowledge, especially if you do not have experience or projects in one of the areas covered by a course that is required for the position. 

## Skills

This section is commonly short, comprised of specific bullet points to assess your skills. In this section you will showcase your technical skills, carefully matching those skills listed in the job posting. You will want to list your skills as subgroups and ensure that they are related to one another. For example, programming languages should be grouped together.  

In addition to listing your skills, you will want to match your description of proficiency to that of the job posting. For example, if the job posting asks for years of experience, write your years of experience in the bullet points. However, if the posting asks for intermediate or beginner proficiency, write your skills in accordance to that format. This rule applies mainly for online applications, where your resume may be scanned for keywords in order to be considered. You will find that matching and tailoring your resume to each application's keywords and requirements will make you stand out better.

A skills section should look similar to this text:

> **Skills** 

> Programming Languages: Intermediate proficiency in Python, C#, Java; beginner proficiency in Swift 

> Software: Visual Studio, Anaconda, XCode, Azure PowerTools

> Frameworks: ASP.NET, Django 

> [!TIP]
> Make use of columns to reduce the vertical space taken by this section

## Experience and projects

This section is split into two parts to differentiate professional experience from projects. Depending on the type of professional experience you have, you will want to have it before or after the Projects subsection. If your professional experience can be linked to the position you are applying to, the Experience subsection must go first. If not, then your projects must be showcased first. Highlighting the areas that can prove your competencies will help recruiters to scan more easily.

The following guidelines can assist you in formatting both subsections:

1. **Project**. Define the name of overall idea of your project, or your role in the case of experience, and write it left aligned on the first line. For example:

    > Calculator Class Project
    >
    > Learn University Gardening Club Member

1. **Dates**. Similar to the expected graduation date, list the dates for both projects and positions. If these projects or positions are ongoing, write the starting date followed by "- Current". This information should be right aligned on the same line as the name/role. 

1. **Describe experience**. Following the title of your project/your role, you will want to add the bullet points describing your experience. Doing so will incorporate the writings we described in the previous unit, under [Describing your experience] (./resume-writing.md). Following the examples used there, the two subsections should be similar to the below text: 

    > **Projects**

    > Calculator Class Project - Example University             December 2020 

    > - Ensured the correct functionality of a calculator program by identifying 15 bugs utilizing Python Exemption classes and debugging tools, implementing fixes and testing the program through 24 test cases 

    >

    > **Experience**

    > Learn University Gardening Club Member               June 2020 - Current 

    > - Maintained the club's nursery by monitoring and caring for number different species of plants, in collaboration with number members

> [!TIP]
> Do not add periods at the end of your bullet points. It helps with the flow of reading and will allow the recruiter to read further without feeling the need to stop too often.
