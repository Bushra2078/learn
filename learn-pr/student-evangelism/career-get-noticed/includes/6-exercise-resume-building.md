Creating a strong resume is your central task as you're seeking an internship. A well-prepared resume can land you a job or at least spark enough interest for a company to reach out to you. 

Before you jump right into creating that resume, though, an interesting question to ask yourself might be, What experiences do I put in it, and how do I describe them? 

In this exercise, you'll learn how to recall experiences and describe them in various interesting ways.

## Step 1: Get it on paper

It's tempting to just start pouring words into a text editor on your computer. But step back for a moment and consider taking a different approach: using physical sticky notes. Separate sticky notes can help you think about each individual experience without the distraction of having to format your text immediately.

Try this:

On each of three sticky notes, write a descriptive title that represents one of your most impactful experiences. Here are three example experiences:

   > 3rd year project - course lab correcting software:
   >
   > University IT Support
   >
   > Master thesis - mobile app for restaurant serving personnel

## Step 2: Describe the experiences

Now let's flesh out the notes slightly with what each experience was about and, most importantly, the impact of your contribution.

1. On one of the three notes, add a description of your experience and your impact on it. Here's how it might look:

   > 3rd year project - course lab correcting software
   >
   > Description: This software corrects a code lab and scores a pass or fail.
   >
   > Impact: This software is used on all "intro to programming classes" which holds 100 students per class. An estimated 1500+ exercises have been corrected using this software.

1. Repeat the exercise on each of the other two sticky notes.

## Step 3: Arrange them by impact

For each of these experiences, consider your impact, and internally rank or grade your notes according to that impact. 

   Your experiences are likely to vary quite a bit. They might be a mix of IT Support, software development, and leadership. It might make sense to rank these experiences according to the job or internship you're seeking. A project that produced, say, an app that was adopted for use by a company likely has a greater impact than a simpler class project you undertook at school.

   For example, if you're looking for a software developer internship, here's a possible ranking, from highest to lowest:

   > Master thesis - mobile app for restaurant serving personnel
   >
   > 3rd year project - course lab correcting software
   >
   > University IT Support

   The first two experiences are all about software development, and having actual code to show for them makes this ranking appropriate. However, depending on the nature of your job, an IT support job can be a great experience to highlight because it demonstrates that you've put service-mindedness, empathy, and other skills to the test.
