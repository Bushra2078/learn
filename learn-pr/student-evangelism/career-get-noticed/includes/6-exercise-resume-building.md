Creating your resume is an important task. A great resume can land you a job or at least enough interest for a company to reach out. An interesting question though is what do you put on the resume and how do you describe it? In this exercise, you'll learn how to recall experiences and describe them in various interesting ways. 

## Get it on paper

It's tempting to start writing down things in a text editor on your computer. Take a step back, and try a different approach, try using sticky notes. By using sticky notes, it allows you to think about each experiences separately and not be distracted with maybe the formatting of text document.

1. Take out three sticky notes, representing your three most impactful experience, and write a descriptive title on each note. Here's an example of five notes:

   > 3rd year project - course lab correcting software:
   >
   > University IT Support
   >
   > Master thesis - mobile app for restaurant serving personnel

## Describe the experiences

At this point you have a set of notes. Now let's flesh them out slightly with what each experience was about and most importantly the impact of your work.

1. Take one of the notes and flesh it out with description and impact. Here's an example of what it can look like:

   > 3rd year project - course lab correcting software
   >
   > Description: This software corrects a code lab and scores a pass or fail.
   >
   > Impact: This software is used on all "intro to programming classes" which holds 100 students per class. An estimated 1500+ exercises have been corrected using this software.

## Arrange by impact

Next, try to think about impact and internally grade your notes by it. Your experiences might be of different kind, maybe it's a mix of IT Support, software development, or leadership? Depending on the job, you search it might make sense to arrange these experiences differently. Also worth considering is that a thing you did being used by a company likely has higher impact than a project you did at University.

1. Arrange the notes by impact. Here's an example arrangement from highest to lowest if you are looking for a software developer position:

   > Master thesis - mobile app for restaurant serving personnel
   >
   > 3rd year project - course lab correcting software
   >
   > University IT Support

   The two experiences at the top are all about software development and having code to show for makes this arrangement ideal. However, depending on the nature of your job, an IT support job can be a great experience to have as it shows service minded, empathy and many other skills being put to the test.
