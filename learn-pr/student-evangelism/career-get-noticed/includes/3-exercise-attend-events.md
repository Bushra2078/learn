The first step to networking, is to attend functions and events within your sphere of interest. In this exercise, you'll find an event to attend and create a plan to make the most out of the networking you do.

## Sign up for a user group

The first step to networking is to find out where to meet people. Within technology, there are user groups, groups that have members that all share a common interest about a technology for example. Next, you will become a member of such a group. Being a member means you will be notified about upcoming events that you can sign up for.

- Go to `http://www.meetup.com` and find meetup groups in your area and join at least a couple of groups that matches your interest:

   For example, join a group on JavaScript and another on Vue.js

## Choose an event to attend

User groups usually have meetings with a monthly cadence. By going to an event, you will be able to meet peers with a similar interest. Your goal for attending such an event should be to establish a personal connection. Sometimes the people you meet will be future colleagues or recruiters. If a hiring manager has met you in person at an event, they might ask you to submit a resume there and then or keep you updated on future opportunities.

1. Sign up for an event. An event usually consists of one or more speakers and at least a break between session. Now is your chance to meet people of interest.

   > Join for example, a tech event on the 15th

1. Set a goal for meeting and conversing with many people at the event.

   For example, decide to speak to at least three different people at the event.

   > It's usually a good idea to talk to the organizer at the event as they tend to know a lot of folks. Additionally, the organizer is more often than not a company looking to hiring people, so bring your resume.

## Network at the event

So you are going to an event, you have a plan to speak to many people. What do you say though? It's not easy to just go up and talk to someone but here's a list of questions you can use:

- What did you think of tonights speaking session/speaker
- How long have you used this tech for?
- Where do you work?
- Any part of the talk you found interesting?
- Be transparent, if you are looking for a job, say so, or maybe you are looking for a consultancy contract or an internship?

Find a time either before the talk or in the break to ask a subset of the questions above.

   Here's an example interaction:

   > You: What did you think of tonight's talk?
   > 
   > New person: Interesting, learned some new things.
   > 
   > You: Have you used this tech before?
   > 
   > New person: No, but eager to try it out.
