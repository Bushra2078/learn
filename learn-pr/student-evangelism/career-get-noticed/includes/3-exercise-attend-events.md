## Sign up for a user group

Start by discovering where to meet people. Within the broad area of technology, you'll find numerous user groups, organizations whose members share a common interest in specific technologies. For example, you might want to join a group on JavaScript or Vue.js. 

Next, you'll join as a member of one or more user groups. By becoming a member, you'll be notified about upcoming group events that you can sign up to participate in.

To find meetup groups in your area, go to [http://www.meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com), and join at least a couple of groups that match your interests.

## Choose an event to attend

<<<<<<< HEAD
Most user groups meet with a monthly cadence. By attending events on a regular basis, you'll begin to meet and get to know peers with similar interests. 

Your goal in participating in such events should be to establish personal connections. Practically everyone you meet will have something valuable to offer, and you'll always learn something new. 

Someone you meet might be a recruiter, a hiring manager, or a future colleague. The person might even ask you to submit your resume or take your contact information and offer to keep you updated on future opportunities.

To get started, complete this exercise:

User groups usually have meetings with a monthly cadence. By going to an event, you will be able to meet peers with a similar interest. Your goal for attending such an event should be to establish a personal connection. Sometimes the people you meet will be future colleagues or recruiters. If a hiring manager has met you in person at an event, they might ask you to submit a resume there and then or keep you updated on future opportunities.

1. Sign up for an event. An event usually consists of one or more speakers and at least a break between session. Now is your chance to meet people of interest.

   > Join for example, a tech event on the 15th

1. Sign up for an event. An example might be a JavaScript event on the 15th of the month.
   
   An event usually consists of one or more speakers or activities, with one or more breaks during that time. Now is your chance to meet people of interest.

1. Set a goal to meet and converse with at least three different people at the event.

   > [!TIP]
   > At the event, it's a good idea to seek out and introduce yourself to the event organizer. That person is likely to be influential and can in turn introduce you to other group members. The organizer might even represent a company that's looking to hire people, so be sure to bring your resume.

## What to say to the people you meet

So now you're signed up for an event, armed with a plan to speak to many people. But what do you say? If you're like most people, it's not easy to simply go up and talk to someone you've never met. 

Here's a short list of questions you can use:

- What did you think of tonight's session or speaker?
- What did you find interesting/exciting/surprising about tonight's talk?
- How long have you used/been interested in this technology?
- Where do you work/what's your role there/for how long/what's interesting about it?

It's a good idea to write down in advance any questions you think you might have for the people you'll be meeting. Remember, the important thing about networking is to develop new connections.

Be transparent. At some point in your conversations, whether you're looking for a job, a consultancy contract, or an internship, say so. Your openness could open up some exciting opportunities. 

Here's an example interaction:

   > You: What did you think of tonight's talk?
   > 
   > New person: Interesting, learned some new things.
   > 
   > You: Have you used this tech before?
   > 
   > New person: No, but eager to try it out.
