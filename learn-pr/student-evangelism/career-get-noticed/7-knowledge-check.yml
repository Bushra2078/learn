        - content: Up to 10 seconds.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Due to the amount of resumes they receive on a daily basis,
            recruiters can only afford to fully read those that comply with the
            position's requirements and peak their interest.
        - content: Anytime between 30 seconds and a minute.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Recruiters take at most 10 seconds on the initial scan, which if
            passed, will determine that your resume should be read in full.
        - content: 5 minutes.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Recruiters take at most 10 seconds on the initial scan, which if
            passed, will determine that your resume should be read in full.
    - content: What are the key sections every student resume should have?
      choices:
        - content: Education, Skills, Experience and/or Projects.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Following that order, these sections provide the most important
            information about a student.
        - content: Education, Experience, Honors and Affiliations.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Although Education and Experience are two of the key sections,
            Honors and Affiliations is not considered a must. The other two key
            sections are Skills and Projects.
        - content: Experience, Projects, Skills, Volunteering
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The most important section for any student resume is the Education
            section. Replace Volunteering with Education and you will have the
            key sections.
    - content: Which of the following experiences descriptions highlight impact?
      choices:
        - content: Improved route accuracy by 15%, through the implementation of a
            real-time updating algorithm, as measured by comparing the number of
            real routes generated before and after the implementation
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: The statement starts by showcasing what the impact was through the
            use of an action verb to highlight the results, then moving on to
            the "how" and finishing with how the impact was measured. For more
            guidance, follow the template mentioned in the Resume Writing Unit.
        - content: Developed a real-time updating algorithm to improve route accuracy
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This statement focuses on explaining what was done, but lacks
            action verbs that relate to impact and does not delve into results.
        - content: Tasked with improving route accuracy by implementing new algorithms and
            measuring the number of real routes
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This statement describes duties, and although it includes the "how"
            and the measures, it does not tackle impact.
