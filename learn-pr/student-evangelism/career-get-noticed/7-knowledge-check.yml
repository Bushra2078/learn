quiz:
  questions:
    - content: How long does a recruiter usually take to initially scan a resume?
      choices:
        - content: Up to 10 seconds.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Because of the volume of resumes they receive daily,
            recruiters can afford the time to fully read only resumes that address the
            position's requirements and pique their interest.
        - content: From 30 seconds to a minute.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Recruiters take at most 10 seconds for an initial resume scan, which, if it passes, determines whether the resume will be read in full.
        - content: 5 minutes.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Recruiters take at most 10 seconds for an initial resume scan, which, if it passes, determines whether the resume will be read in full.
    - content: What are the key sections that every student resume should have?
      choices:
        - content: Education, Skills, and Experience and/or Projects
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: When they're presented in this order, these sections provide the most important
            information about a student.
        - content: Education, Experience, and Honors and Affiliations
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Although Education and Experience are two key sections, an Honors and Affiliations section is not considered a must. The other two key sections are Skills and Projects.
        - content: Experience, Projects, Skills, and Volunteering
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The most important section in any student resume is the Education section. Replace Volunteering with an Education section, and you will have the key sections.
    - content: Which one of the following Experience descriptions highlights your impact?
      choices:
        - content: Improved route accuracy by 15% through the implementation of a real-time updating algorithm, as measured by comparing the number of real routes generated before and after the implementation
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: The statement starts by showcasing the impact by using an action verb to highlight the results, moves on to the "how," and finishes with how the impact was measured. For more guidance, follow the template mentioned in the "Write your resume" unit.
        - content: Developed a real-time updating algorithm to improve route accuracy
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This statement focuses on explaining what was done, but lacks action verbs that relate to impact and doesn't highlight measurable results.
        - content: Tasked with improving route accuracy by implementing new algorithms and measuring the number of real routes
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This statement describes duties and, although it includes the "how" and the measures, it doesn't tackle impact.
