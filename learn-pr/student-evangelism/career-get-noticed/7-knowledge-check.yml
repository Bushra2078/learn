quiz:
  questions:
    - content: You meet a class mate that got the intern position you both applied for and you never heard back from. What could be the reason for this outcome?
      choices:
        - content: They had the better resume.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Most likely not, you both have the same education, and comparable experiences.
        - content: They went to that hackathon you didn't have time for as you were studying for an exam.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: While at the hackathon, your class mate met with representatives for several companies, including representative from the company you both applied for. That personal impression was enough to make the recruiter remember your class mate and pass their resume to the hiring manager. 
        - content: Your class mate was just lucky in being picked over you.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: While luck may play a role, you can increase the likelihood of luck by partaking in networking events. If an opportunity presents where you can meet representatives from a company, do what you can to make the most of it.
    - content: How long does a recruiter usually take to initially scan a resume?
      choices:
        - content: Up to 10 seconds.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Due to the amount of resumes they receive on a daily basis,
            recruiters can only afford to fully read resumes that comply with the
            position's requirements and peak their interest.
        - content: Anytime between 30 seconds and a minute.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Recruiters take at most 10 seconds on the initial scan, which if
            passed, will determine that your resume should be read in full.
        - content: 5 minutes.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Recruiters take at most 10 seconds on the initial scan, which if
            passed, will determine that your resume should be read in full.
    - content: Which of the following experiences descriptions highlight impact?
      choices:
        - content: Improved route accuracy by 15%, through the implementation of a
            real-time updating algorithm, as measured by comparing the number of
            real routes generated before and after the implementation
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: The statement starts by showcasing what the impact was through the
            use of an action verb to highlight the results, then moving on to
            the "how" and finishing with how the impact was measured. For more
            guidance, follow the template mentioned in the Resume Writing Unit.
        - content: Developed a real-time updating algorithm to improve route accuracy
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This statement focuses on explaining what was done, but lacks
            action verbs that relate to impact and does not delve into results.
        - content: Tasked with improving route accuracy by implementing new algorithms and
            measuring the number of real routes
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This statement describes duties, and although it includes the "how"
            and the measures, it does not tackle impact.
