quiz:
  questions:
    - content: You meet a class mate that got the intern position you both applied for and you never heard back from. What could be the reason for this outcome?
      choices:
        - content: They had the better resume.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Most likely not, you both have the same education, and comparable experiences.
        - content: They went to that hackathon you didn't have time for as you were studying for an exam.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: While at the hackathon, your class mate met with representatives for several companies, including representative from the company you both applied for. That personal impression was enough to make the recruiter remember your class mate and pass their resume to the hiring manager. 
        - content: Your class mate was just lucky in being picked over you.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: While luck may play a role, you can increase the likelihood of luck by partaking in networking events. If an opportunity presents where you can meet representatives from a company, do what you can to make the most of it.
    - content: How long does a recruiter usually take to initially scan a resume?
      choices:
        - content: Up to 10 seconds
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Because of the volume of resumes they receive daily,
            recruiters can afford the time to fully read only resumes that address the
            position's requirements and pique their interest.
        - content: From 30 seconds to a minute
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Recruiters take at most 10 seconds for an initial resume scan, which determines whether the resume will be read in full.
        - content: 5 minutes

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Although Education and Experience are two key sections, an Honors and Affiliations section is not considered a must. The other two key sections are Skills and Projects.
