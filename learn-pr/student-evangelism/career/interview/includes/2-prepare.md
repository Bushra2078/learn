The first thing to understand about interviews is that there are different types of interviews, therefore preparing for them might be different.

As a software developer, you are likely to encounter more than one type of interview. Depending on the type of interview, you need to prepare differently. The reason these different types of interviews exist, is so that they not only can assess your tech skill level, but your ability to function in a team, cause software development is a team sport. It's common that candidates spend all their time honing their technical skills but forget that they will work with people, in a team.

## Types of interviews

Depending on the size of the company, you might go through as little as two interviews and as much as 10 interviews. Some companies are able to carry out most interviews in one 1-2 days and some others take months. For you being interviewed, it's important that you know what types of interviews exist and how to best prepare for them. You will need to invest much time into preparing for these interviews to land your dream job. The type of interviews that exist are usually:

- **Coding interview**. In this interview, you are tested on your coding skills. There might be more than one, of this type of interview like a take home test and or questions over the phone. There's also an in-person version of this interview, where you either get asked new questions or is asked to explain code you've already written in a previous step. The people carrying out these interviews are most likely future colleagues from your intended team or from another team.
- **System design**. If you are a little more senior, you are likely to encounter an interview type where your ability to design systems is assessed. The idea is to evaluate whether you understand how to build more complex applications that may have dependencies to other systems even.
- **Manager**. You are likely to have an interview with a prospective manager. This is a chance for both you and a manager to assess one another. The manager wants to see if you are someone who would fit in the team. You on the other hand can see if this manager is someone you would like to work for.
- **HR**. At some part of the interview cycle, you are likely to have a talk to someone representing Human Relations, HR. Here you have the chance to ask questions on broader things you want to know about company culture, unions, and other practical information. If this happens in the beginning of the cycle, ask as many questions as you can, it helps you prepare for what's next.

## Preparing for the tech interviews

No two tech companies are the same, so knowing how to prepare can be tricky. There are some things to consider like what kind of company you are dealing with and what their focus is:

- **Algorithm focused**. Such a company are likely to give you tasks where you are asked to implement things like binary trees, shortest path problems and so on. Usually the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) companies belong to this category.
- **Enterprise focused**. A large part of the companies out there are focused on enterprise software, so called line-of-business applications or LOB. The challenges for this kind of companies are different as they usually have applications that's been around for a long time. Challenges are more around maintaining applications, refactoring old code and focus is less on performance but rather integration between systems.

So how do you know what kind of company I'm applying for, algorithms or not? You can do research here, check web pages like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm) and try using search engines. It's fairly easy to find this out. The so called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) uses mostly algorithms to test.  

### Algorithm focused company

> What does it mean when they use algorithms, what are they after?

You are given a specific problem and you are expected to do two things, firstly, select an appropriate algorithm for the problem and secondly understand the limitations of it and understand what happens when it scales. With _scales_ it's meant what happens when the input to a function increases, how will your algorithm perform. Algorithm performance is denoted as O(n), also known as [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). There are many web pages out there explaining how to calculate O(n) on you algorithm, here's one page explaining the basics, [Calculating Big O](https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/calculating-bigo/).

The reason these companies ask about algorithms and their performance is that the type of problems you will be faced with are likely of that nature.

### Preparing for algorithmic interview

> Ok, so how do I practice algorithms then?

There exist many sites dedicated to just that. In fact, many recruiters at these FAANG companies will in some cases tell folks in the interview pipeline to prepare for the interviews by using some of the below platforms and practice problems:

- [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com) 
- [Coderbyte](https://www.coderbyte.com)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
- [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

These platforms offer many problems to try to solve and will let you use many different programming languages to do so. Usually you get assessed on how well you solved something, which means a solution that _works_ receives a lower score than one that is optimal.

Another way to practice is by picking up books on the topic that may contain problems but also that helps guide you through the interview process like the below examples:

- [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
- [Here's a curated list of algorithm books](https://hackernoon.com/10-data-structure-algorithms-books-every-programmer-should-read-d50487313127)

GitHub has become a great source of knowledge on preparing for tech interview as well. Here are some popular repositories:

- [Coding interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
- [Free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [The algorithms, Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)

## Enterprise focused

There's another type of company, the enterprise one. This kind of company has so called LOBs, line-of-business applications that fetch data from a data source and presents it in some kind of UI usually. Often a myriad of different frameworks and languages have been used and these applications has a long longevity.

To work as a software engineer at a company like this is vastly different. It's different as you are expected to know how to manage code written in different styles and frameworks and either change it into something more manageable, so called _refactoring_ or to just add the bare minimum to it, to fix a bug or add a feature. There's also a strong focus on integrating one or many applications with one another using various techniques like import jobs, message queues and so on. 

The skill set needed to work with such code is different, you don't need to be a star on writing the most performing algorithm but you do need to understand architectural patterns and when to use what pattern.

### Preparing for enterprise code interview

To prepare for these types of interviews, you need to read up on patterns. It's also a good idea to look up something called Katas. Katas are exercises, a set of problems that are common. The idea of the Katas is to practice your skills just like it's namesake Kata that derives from practicing in Karate. By practicing a specific exercise, you learn the exercise and over time, you learn how to solve it better. This way of practicing builds a skill that you are ideally able to put into use in your everyday life as a coder. Katas are not for beginners only, but for anyone looking to hone their skills in the industry.

Below is a list of links regarding these two topics:

- [Software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
- [Design patterns book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8) by Erich Gamma et al.
- [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) by Martin Fowler. This book has become almost an industry standard and is worth the read.
- [Katas](https://codingdojo.org/kata/)

## Context matters

Another thing to consider when preparing for a tech interview is that some companies will let you program a problem in your language of choice but many companies out there will likely want you to use a specific language or framework. Therefore, you are likely to get questions around that. To prepare for such interviews, you need to read up on how to best "do things" in a language or framework.  For example, for JavaScript you are likely to get questions on how the language works and its patterns, but for .NET it might be more on how do I solve this problem using the framework.

### How to prepare for context?

You can usually use a search engine to find the most common questions asked for a programming language or framework. For example, for JavaScript here's a few links:

- [37 JavaScript questions](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions)
- [85 JavaScript questions](https://www.guru99.com/javascript-interview-questions-answers.html)

The best tip here in general, is to implement many small projects, that will make you learn things in a better way. Here's a set of links, ideas for projects:

- [40 JavaScript projects to build](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/)
- [Web Dev For Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners). 24 lessons with exercises. Seven major projects and available in 11+ languages.

## Reach out

It's great if you can spend as much time as possible preparing by trying to solve various problems. However, don't be afraid to reach out to the recruiter or recruitment team and ask for guidelines and materials. Having these kind of materials can help you focus on what this company feel is important. Some companies will send "how to prepare" material to the candidate, but if they don't, reach out. The worst thing you can hear, is no we don't have that, at least you know at that point. 

> [!TIP]
> Be brave ask for guidance and preparation content, it shows interest but will also increase the likelihood that you pass the interview.

## General guidelines

It's great if you can prepare as much as possible on things tech. One thing you mustn't forget about though is how to behave while at the interview. Also you have a right to expect a certain behavior from the company in turn. Let's start with you, knowing what to avoid might lead to an offer, but the opposite might lead to a "no hire" decision despite you being a star at algorithms. 

- **Work history**. Ensure your work history is accounted for. If you have a gap in your resume, ensure there's a reasonable explanation like, you studied something, maybe it was a medical reason. It doesn't look good at all if there are gaps. This is something you can bring up on the interview and the company is likely to ask, so ensure you have answers prepared.
- **Job hopping**. If you spend to short of time at each workplace then a lot of prospective employers will see that as a risk. Why should they spend resources and time on someone who's gone in 6 months for example. There are nuances to this, in the beginning of your career it's more forgiving if you jump around a little finding what you really like to do. In general, the longer your career is, the longer you are expected to stay. With that said the IT industry has quite short turn around. 2-3 years is still an ok time to stay at a company. You want to avoid < 1.5 years of tenure. Staying too long is also a risky behavior unless you move roles internally or advance to a higher level. There are many reasons why people switch companies, better pay, advancement, greater opportunity, sometimes you might need to stick it out a bit.
- **Speaking ill of former employers**. I mean it's understandable that you sometimes don't get along with a former manager or people at your former workplace. The interview is not a time to bring that up usually, unless you need to explain a shorter tenure. If you have to bring it up, ensure you are speaking about it in terms of growth, what did you learn. 
- **Be professional**. Be on time always, be ahead of time even. Sometimes the traffic is bad, if you know you are going to be late, let them know, email, phone, whatever works. Be polite and nice.
- **Team player**. Being a developer, or most jobs in general, is about being a team player. As such you didn't do that big project all by yourself, do explain your part in it but try to not come off like you know everything and you did everything, be humble but confident.

### What about the company

We've talked about you and you being on your best behavior, but there's something to be said about the company as well. You have a right to be treated with respect. So what are things to look out for?

- **Reputation**. The company has a bad reputation, wither by word of mouth or on sites ranking companies. You can do your homework and find this out before accepting an interview.
- **Role unclear**. There's no clear idea of what your responsibilities are. If it's a startup you can somewhat to be expected to help out here and there. However, a large enterprise company should be able to be clear on this point.
- **People speak ill of colleagues**. If folks you are interviewing with speaks ill of folks, on the same or other teams, that's really not good.
- **No manager in the interview pipe**. If you're not meeting with a manager that looks strange is most likely a bad sign. A good manager will help you grow and not even be able to meet them before signing is less than ideal.
- **Lack of respect**. You should be treated with respect. The company should respect you and your time, sudden cancellations of interviews or interviews that end abruptly are bad signs. Another bad sign is them not communicating after an interview, you have a right to know whether you got the job or not.
