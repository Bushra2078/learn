### Culture questions

You will get questions to see how much of a team player you are. For example, you might get asked about your strength and weaknesses and how you would handle a conflict. Both those questions are hard to answer. Strengths are easy to list but what about weaknesses? Do I really want to let an employer know my weaknesses?

> Turn a weakness into a strength

The way to answer that question is to tell a story involving your weakness and how you turned it into a strength. You can think out such an answer ahead of time as it's a common question to get.


What about conflict resolution? This question is often difficult to answer. Point to a situation in the past that speaks in your favor. If you don't have a clear example, then speak in a more general way about how you listen to other peoples' points of view. Celebrate diversity of thought.

> Do you have any questions for me?

It's easy to think, as a beginner, that this is a question you can just answer by saying "no, no questions." In fact, this is where you should show your enthusiasm and preparedness. The more positive and enthusiastic you come across, the more likely you are to land the role, given that your tech tests are good enough. Having questions prepared for your interviewer is crucial.

## Salary negotiation

> [!NOTE]
> While finding your very first job, you might not get the option to negotiate the salary at all. Salary might only be mentioned on the application details page. With a few more years experience, you should be able to advocate for yourself.

If your interview results in an offer, that means you did a great job at the interview. Well done!

You might think that, being new to the industry, you need to accept whatever is offered. This is somewhat true, but you do have a right to expect a certain level. You can find out what that level is by checking what a graduate with your degree normally gets or what this position should pay.



### How to ask for what you want

It's hard to advocate for yourself, but to get what you want, you need the employer to understand what value you bring to the company. Do your research to understand the company's needs and requirements in an employee. Ask the recruiter about it. Leverage your strengths: it's possible that any previous non-technical experience, like working with customer support, could make you a valuable employee paired with your technical skills. At the end of the day, an employer wants a person that cares for the product and its users.

### Details of the offer

Remember that not everything is about money. Think of this part as negotiating about a package. Such a package can consist of:

- base salary
- health insurance/dental insurance
- bonus and/or stocks 
- training, courses and conferences
- health benefits

If you have offers from more than one company, try to compare the offers from the above mentioned items. Only you know what matters most to you.

## Follow up

There are two types of following up to an offer of employment: one between interviews and one after the last one. For example, if you first have a phone interview and pass that, you might be sent guidelines and preparation docs. At that point it's a good idea to contact the recruiter and tell them when you are ready to proceed to the next phase. If this is a large company, they might give you anything from days, to weeks and months to prepare for the next phase, i.e the technical interview.

> Ask for estimated time for next phase in the interview process, it will help you plan and see how long you have.

### After the final interview

One thing that candidates often forget about is following up. An elegant and nice thing to do is to write back, right after the interview and thank them for the opportunity to speak to the company. It also gives the prospective employer a chance to come back to you if there are any updates. If you aren't picked this time, they might come back to you in the future if new positions open up; everybody remembers a nice candidate. Also if you don't get picked, ask for feedback to improve yourself and guarantee future success.
