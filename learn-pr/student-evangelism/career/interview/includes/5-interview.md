[placeholder for Redmond interview]

So much for the tech interview. While that is an important one, the other interviews, the non tech ones are what might settle it. Do great here and you might out compete someone with longer experience, or better education on paper.

### You are a team player in a team

These types of interviews are about attitude, and how you would function in a workplace. Most of the time, developing software, it's a team sport, you build it together, you fix bugs together and you ship it all, together.

### Tricky questions

You will get questions to see how much of a team player you are. For example, you might get asked about your strength and weaknesses and how you would handle a conflict. Both those questions are hard to answer. Strengths are usually easy to list but what about weaknesses? Do I really want to let an employer know my weaknesses?

> Turn a weakness into a strength

The way to answer that question is to tell a story involving your weakness and you turned it into a strength. You can think out such an answer ahead of time cause it's a quite common question to get.

> Keep asking questions to understand

What about conflict resolution? This question is also tricky to answer, cause either you had a job before and you are able to draw on experience or maybe you were playing a sport or even a computer game like League of Legends. The point is, point to a situation in the past that speaks in your favour. If you don't have a clear example, then go with something like I try to understand the other ones perspective to understand why they think and do things in a certain way. Some people are just difficult, but some other people thinks about things differently and that's great. Celebrate diversity of thought.

### Salary negotiation

If your interview results in an offer, that means you did a great job at the interview, congrats.

You might think being all new to the industry that you need to accept whatever is offered. It's a little bit like that, but you do have a right to expect a certain level. You can find out what that level is by checking what a graduate with your degree normally gets or what this position should pay.

This part is also a bit relying on your performance throughout the interview process. Generally, ensure the employer brings up this topic first. It's a bit tricky because you don't want to say a number that's way higher than the employer have in mind, but you don't want to say a number that's too low either. Again, get the employer to say something first, if it's too far from what you have in mind, walk away.

However there is one thing to keep in mind, how valuable is the experience working for this particular company? Folks in the IT industry quite often take up a position for lower than they wanted cause the experience is so valuable. Such experience will enable them to land a great job at the next employer.

## Follow up

One thing candidates often forget about is following up. A very elegant, and generally nice thing to do, is to write back, right after the interview and thank for the opportunity, someone spent time and resources getting all of this together. It also gives the prospective employer a chance to come back to you if there are any updates. Also if you weren't picked this time, chances are they might come back to you in the future if new positions open up, everybody remembers the nice candidate. Also if you don't get picked, ask for feedback, trying to improve is the best thing do to here, adopt a _growth mindset_.
