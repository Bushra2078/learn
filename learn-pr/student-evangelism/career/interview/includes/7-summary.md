In this module you've been taught about the interview process and how to hopefully pass it. 

Firstly you learned how to prepare for various types of interviews. There are various platforms and links you can read up on to ensure you practice and build your skill set.

Then you were taken to the point of the interview, how to prepare for it, both from skill stand point but also how to physically and mentally prepare. Being interviewed can be a bit stressful but practice makes perfect and knowing what the interviewers expect both on tech and non-tech questions should make this experience a bit more manageable.

Lastly you focused on things like etiquette, how to leave a lasting good impression and how to approach the topic of salary negotiation.

Hopefully you feel a bit more empowered having read through all content. Definitely have a look at the links below and other links left earlier in the module to ensure you are set up for success - you can do this.
