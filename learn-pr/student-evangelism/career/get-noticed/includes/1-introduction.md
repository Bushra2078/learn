As you begin your search for internships or full time jobs, you will notice that there seems to be a lot of information on how to best prepare for interviews. However, one key element often left forgotten is how to get noticed in the first place. In order for you to land an interview, you need to have been "*screened*" by a recruiter. Screening will only happen if you are able to stand out from the rest. Let's jump to a scenario to further illustrate the case.
