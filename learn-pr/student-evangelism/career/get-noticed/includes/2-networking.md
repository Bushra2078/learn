Networking is one of the most important factors in starting your career, yet it is often overlooked. Networking encompasses an array of elements that can be helpful in advancing your career. These elements not only provide opportunities for you to grow and learn, but also increase your skills in communication and teamwork. 

There are many types of networking that all provide both personal and career growth. Here are some things you can do to network:

- Discuss topics with your peers
- Join and attend organizational meetings
- Become part of a school's club
- Attend tutoring sessions
- Collaborate in all aspects of open source software development

## Is networking reserved to only in-person situations?

Not at all! Connecting with others via online interactions is also a form of networking. Asking or answering questions on forums and collaborating in websites such as GitHub or in other types of open-source projects provide the same opportunities of learning and professional growth as any in-person situations.

## How can I get started in networking?

There are multiple ways to get started in networking. Here are some ideas to get started.

### Join a Student Organization

Student organizations provide one of the best opportunities for networking. The members of these organizations can interact with you as peers and will most likely share common interests with you. With that in mind, connecting with them and learning about their experiences while also sharing your own is a great first step in networking. In addition to joining a student organization, participating and collaborating in such an organization will promote the development of incredibly valuable soft-skills such as communication, time management, and teamwork through events and socials.

### Collaborate in open-source projects that interest you

Participating in open-source development, or OSS, allows you to have a direct impact on interesting projects while honing your technical skills. In this scenario, networking occurs by means of comments, fixes, and interactions with others who are also working on the same project. By working on these OSS projects you learn from both experienced and inexperienced peers, from different parts of the world and often with different points of view. 

### Participate in Hackathons

Hackathons are a reliable opportunity to network with your peers and meet representatives of interesting companies. During a hackathon you can work with a group of like-minded people to develo a project over a set period of time. Eventually you will be able to showcase your skills and participate in challenges posted by the hackathon hosts. In doing so you also get access to resources and connections provided by the organizing team, which tend to include sponsoring companies' employees. This way, you can both ask questions about these companies and share a bit of your story and interests. Your conversations may lead to an interview or an invitation to apply for a job.
