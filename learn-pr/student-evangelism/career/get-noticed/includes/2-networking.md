One of the most important yet often overlooked factors in starting your career is Networking. Networking encompasses an array of elements that can be helpful in advancing your career, as these not only provide opportunities to grow and learn, but also increase your skills in communication and teamwork. 

There are many types of networking that all provide both personal and career growth. Here are some things you can do to network:

- Discussing topics with your peers.
- Joining or attending organizational meetings.
- Becoming part of a school's club, attending tutoring sessions.
- Creating forum posts or collaborating in open source are forms of networking.

## Is networking reserved to only in-person situations?

Not at all! Connecting with others by online interactions is also a form of networking. By asking or answering questions on forums, collaborating in websites such as GitHub or in other types of Open-Source projects provide the same opportunities of learning and professional growth as any in-person situations.

## How can I get started in networking?

There are multiple ways to get started in networking. Here are some ideas to get started and how to realize them.

### Join a Student Organization

Student organizations provide one of the best grounds for networking. The members of these organizations stand at the same grounds as you, and will most likely share common interests. With that in mind, connecting with them and learning about their experiences (while also sharing your own) is a great first step in networking. In addition to joining a student organization; participating/collaborating in such an organization be it through events, meetings or socials, will promote the development of incredibly valuable soft-skills such as communication, time management, and teamwork.

### Collaborate in open-source projects that interest you

Participating in Open-Source development, or OSS, allows you to have a direct impact on projects of your interest, while practicing some of your technical skills as well. In this scenario, networking happens from comments, fixes, and interactions with others who are also working on the same project. By working on these OSS projects you learn from both experienced and inexperienced peers, from different parts of the world. 

### Participate in Hackathons

Hackathons are a reliable opportunity to network with both peers and companies of your interest. The general idea of a Hackathon is to get together with a group of like-minded people to work on developing a project over a set period of time, with the goals of showcasing your skills and participating in challenges posted by the Hackathon hosts. During this time, you also get access to resources and connections provided by the organizing team, which tend to include company representatives and employees. This way, you can both ask questions about said companies, but also share a bit of your story and interests, which may well lead to an interview or invitation to apply for a job.
