In this module, our goal was to help you evaluate how 5G technologies combine with Azure private MEC help to create new solutions for the enterprise. First, we described the components of the Azure private MEC solution for 5G to create new enterprise solutions. Then, we applied the analysis to the scenario and outlined the advantages and disadvantages of using 5G technology. Without deploying 5G and Azure private MEC technologies, it would not be possible to deploy IoT sensors with very low latency requirements. The supporting Azure technologies also help create a service that spans the edge and the cloud taking advantage of the new connectivity mechanisms and providing a familiar and consistent interface for Azure developers.
