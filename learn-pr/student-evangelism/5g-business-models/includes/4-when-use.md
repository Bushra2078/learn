Azure private MEC enables you to leverage the power of 5G for your enterprise applications. Here are some of the decision criteria to select applications suitable for the use of Azure private MEC:

- **Ultra-low latency IoT applications:** The primary consideration for the choice of 5G and Azure private MEC is the need for ultra-low latency applications â€“ especially for IoT devices. 

- **Applications needing a high device density:** If you require high-density device connectivity, conventional techniques fail. Hence, 5G and Azure private MEC may be considered as part of the service. 

- **Live video analytics (LVA):** If you have live video analytics applications, 5G and Azure private MEC is suitable because LVA needs low latency and high bandwidth. the ability to capture

- **Edge analytics:** If you need to deploy analytics on edge devices, especially with real-time considerations, 5G and Azure private MEC could play a role

 

To apply these criteria, you should consider the following additional aspects:

- **You may need to run a mixture of LTE and 5G connectivity:** 5G deployment will be gradual. Hence, you may need to run a mixture of 5G and LTE-connected devices for some time.

- **Comparison to Wi-Fi:** 5G provides greater connectivity options especially coupled with the need to deploy sensors in higher density. But this advantage has to be balanced against the affordability and ubiquity of Wi-Fi. Specifically, the 5G use case could be made based on applications that need low latency which cannot be provided by Wi-Fi (either for coverage or for latency metrics themselves)
