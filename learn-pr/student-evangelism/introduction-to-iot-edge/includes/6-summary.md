Consider the example of the doctor who uses an IoT device to monitor glucose levels needing an immediate response. An algorithm is run on the device which creates the alert. The device runs even when connectivity is poor. In this situation, IoT Edge can help solve the doctorâ€™s problem. IoT Edge can provide the ability to run modules (algorithms) securely on edge devices even under intermittent connectivity. In the absence of the IoT Edge, the developer would have to create all the functionality themselves (example: security, deploying machine learning on edge devices, offline operation , etc.). By using IoT Edge, you can focus on the business problem at hand (providing care to the patient and responding to emergency scenarios).
