  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What part of a for-loop would you need to modify to increment its
        iteration by 5?
      choices:
        - content: condition
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! A condition is needed to change the amount of times it
            iterates.
        - content: counter
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- a different element of a loop must change to increase
            iteration.
        - content: iteration-expression
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- a different element of a loop must change to increase
            iteration.
    - content: What's the difference between a while and a for-loop?
      choices:
        - content: A for-loop has a counter and iteration-expression, where while only has
            a condition
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct- for loops and while differ in ways they can be used.
        - content: A while has a counter and iteration-expression, where for-loop only has
            a condition.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- this is not how for-loops and while operate.
        - content: They are the same, just an alias for one another
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- this is not how for-loops and while operate.
    - content: Given the code for (let i=1; i < 5; i++), how many iterations will it
        perform?
      choices:
        - content: "5"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- the code will iterate as long the variable is less than 5.
        - content: "4"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! The code will iterate 4 times, starting at 1 as long as i
            is less than 5.
        - content: "0"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect- the code will iterate as long the variable is less than 5.
