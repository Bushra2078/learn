JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, and allows developers to creative interactive content on their websites. Since JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, it allows users to execute code on the user's device. Imagine having to reload a page each time information changed on your device, not having ways to check if data was correctly formatted before submitting a form, or not being able to move an object around interactively on a screen. Without JavaScript, these tasks would not be possible on most websites!

In this module, you will learn about the structural format and uses of arrays in JavaScript, and introduce the ways loops can assist with repetitive tasks involving the data within arrays.
