JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Developers use it to create interactive content on their websites. 

Because JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, it allows users to execute code on their devices. 

Imagine having to reload a webpage each time information changes on your device, being unable to check whether data is correctly formatted before you submit a form, or being unable to move an object around interactively on a screen. Without JavaScript, these tasks would be impossible on most websites.

In this module, you'll learn about the structural format and uses of arrays in JavaScript, and how loops can assist you with repetitive tasks involving the data within arrays.
