Now that you're familiar with JavaScript arrays and loops, you can start thinking about ways to structure and organize data in your JavaScript code.

To practice what you've learned, visit some of your favorite websites and consider the data types used throughout them. For example, consider the way items are added and removed from an online shopping cart, or a player's gear and inventory are added and removed in a browser-based game. Consider why and how loops and arrays might be used.

As you move forward with your knowledge of arrays and loops, you'll start noticing these data types and storage methods on the websites you use every day.

>[!TIP]
>Arrays in JavaScript have many methods attached to them, and these methods are useful for data manipulation. [Read up on these methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/?azure-portal=true), and try out some of them (such as `push`, `pop`, `slice`, and `splice`) on an array of your creation.
