In this module, you explored the scenario of caring for patients with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease – and the unique challenges that patients with degenerative mental conditions present for carers. You identified specific challenges, such as providing reminders and catering for memory loss. We saw how a combination of Azure private MEC and 5G help to provide solutions to cope with the need for rapid responses and unpredictable challenges.

A video analytics solution based on Azure private MEC and 5G is beneficial for monitoring, tracking, and preventative diagnostics. The rapid intervention which is possible through this solution helps to improve safety and provide a scalable solution.
