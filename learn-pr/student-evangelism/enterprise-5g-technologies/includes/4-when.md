Deciding when to use 5G and Azure private MEC depends on various considerations. Here, we outline some of the options you need to consider in your decision-making process.

## Core value proposition

The core value proposition for 5G and Azure private MEC depends on the following primary criteria:

- Your service needs high bandwidth
- Your service needs low latency
- You need a high density of sensor deployment
- You're deploying complex IoT Edge applications or live video analytics applications
- You need to integrate your 5G service into your broader Azure ecosystem to provide an end-to-end service
- You want to develop by using familiar Azure tool sets

## Technology choices

Having addressed the core value proposition, you need to make several technology choices as the next step in your deployment.

### Edge devices or datacenter?

Are you deploying on edge devices or a datacenter? If you're deploying on an edge device, you should consider Azure Stack Edge. If you're deploying on a datacenter, you should consider Azure Stack HCI. In both cases, you use the same tool sets to deploy and manage your application.

### End to end deployment considerations

To deploy your service end to end, you need to consider some more Azure tools. These tools include Azure IoT Edge Runtime, Azure IoT Hub, Azure IoT Central, Azure Digital Twins, Azure Video Analyzer, and Media Service Storage.

### What components should you use to manage your deployment?

Once you deploy your application, how are you going to manage it on a day-to-day basis? Here, you have a few choices, such as the Azure Network Functions Manager and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

### Mobile network or systems integrator considerations

Typically, you deploy new 5G based services as a partnership between an enterprise, a network operator, and a systems integrator. Participants in the collaborative 5G ecosystem get various benefits as part of their value proposition. For example, if you're a mobile network provider or a systems integrator, you could access fusion core and Affirmed Private Network Service (APNS) through the marketplace.

## Application areas

The primary defining characteristics of 5G applications are high bandwidth for video, IoT Edge analytics, and sensor density. As we've seen, these characteristics are applicable for the health monitoring of dementia patients. You could also apply 5G and Azure Private MEC to other areas, including:

- **Manufacturing** -  For real-time automation, especially in robotics.
- **Smart spaces** - Digital kiosks and signage connected to real-time events and information in airports or stadiums.
- **Transportation** - Improved efficiencies for aircraft turnaround.
- **Public safety and health** - Near real-time data capabilities for safety and to improve passenger flow.
- **Retail** - Identification of out-of-stock items.
- **Infrastructure** - Early infrastructure deterioration protection and predictive maintenance for critical infrastructure.
