Computer simulations are a powerful tool in data science as they can help data scientists understand the properties of random quantities that would be complicated to analyze and compute in other ways. In this module, you walked through various Computer Science & Statistics concepts & techniques, which when put together empower you to code, run, and justify your own simulations. 

Here are some of the learning objectives accomplished in this module.

- Study the idea of randomness, analyzed its importance, learned relevant terminology and studied the Law of Averages.
- Examine different types of samples and different sampling techniques.
- Learn about Empirical & Probability Distributions and their differences.
- Explore various components of a simulation and simulate a statistic.
