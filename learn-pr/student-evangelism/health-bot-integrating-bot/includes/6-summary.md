In this module the health Bot was connected to SQL server hosted on Microsoft Azure. The data connection scenario step allows us to seamlessly connect to the database. Initially we used the data connect block to insert data into the database using the POST method. The next block was used to retrieve the data from the database using GET method. There are other HTTP methods available on health bots data connect block. Normal SQL database was used, which we had provisioned on Microsoft Azure. The connection strings played major role to connect the database and the logic apps. Logic app here helped us to create own customized API.
