The **Configuration** menu contains detailed configuration items that can control every aspect of the Health Bot instance functionality and apply to every scenario. The configuration items are grouped in **Medical**, **Compliance**, and **Conversation** categories.

## Medical protocols

On the **Medical protocols** tab, you can configure the behavior of the built-in triage and symptom checking and medical information scenarios.

Let's start with the configuration of the built-in medical **Triage and symptom checking** scenario.

### Terms and consent

Configure terms and consent to meet legal requirements. For example, if you've enabled the consent mechanism, users will be prompted to agree to your Terms of Use and Privacy policy before they can interact with the bot.

## Conversation

Under **Conversation** configuration, the following topics can be changed.

### Interactions

Configure built-in scenarios that interact with your users. For example, you can configure:

* Default error or retry messages.
* A default message when returning from interrupting scenarios.
* A default reply for utterances that aren't understood.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-interactions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Interactions tab options.":::

You can also change the automatic welcome message that appears when users first enter the chat. Or, you can use a custom scenario as an automatic welcome scenario. The automatic welcome scenario overrides the automatic welcome message.

### Navigation

Configure the built-in scenarios that help users navigate conversations. Examples include the **cancel**, **start over**, and **help** commands.

:::image type="content" source="../media/3-navigation.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Navigation tab.":::

In the **Help** section, you can control every aspect of the help menu. You can add or remove items and edit the description of each menu item.

:::image type="content" source="../media/3-help-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Help section.":::

### Cognitive Services

Health Bot provides Bing Speller to pass all utterances through a spell check before processing by the natural language understanding model. If Bing Speller is enabled, user utterances are spell checked if they aren't understood in their original spelling. For example, a user might have spelling mistakes. 

On the **Cognitive Services** tab, you can configure the:

* Spelling verification message that displays when the speller has corrected an utterance.
* Message that displays when the speller has corrected an utterance but user intent wasn't understood.
* Message that displays when the user rejects spelling verification.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-correction.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Spelling correction.":::

### Human Handoff

Health Bot can be used to provide users with chat support from live agents. In some cases, it's preferable to transfer users from a bot interaction to a human conversation. For example:

* A triage flow can be handed off to a doctor or nurse.
* Support agents can resolve issues that require nongeneric assistance.
* The user can ask to be transferred to a human.

On the **Human Handoff** tab, you can enable handoff to human agents' functionality and configure related parameters. Examples are user and agent timeout and messages that are displayed when a user is waiting for an agent to connect or when an agent connects to a conversation. Handoff to live agents by using Microsoft Teams and integration with Dynamics require more configuration.
