# Introduction

The Azure Health Bot Service supports many built-in scenarios: for example, triage a medical condition, find information about a disease or types of drugs and get end-user consent. In addition, tenants have detailed configurable control over definitions of functionality and behavior of the service and have the ability to extend the functionality by authoring new scenarios.

## What is a scenario?

Scenarios are conversational flows that are programmed into the bot. Typically, when a scenario is triggered by the health bot, the user completes a series of questions and answers until the scenario is complete. There are two types of scenarios: built-in and custom scenarios.
