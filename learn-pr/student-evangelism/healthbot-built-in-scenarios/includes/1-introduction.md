Azure Health Bot supports many built-in scenarios. Some examples are to triage a medical condition, find information about a disease or types of drugs, and get user consent. In addition, tenants have detailed configurable control over definitions of functionality and behavior of the service. They also can extend the functionality by authoring new scenarios.

## What is a scenario?

Scenarios are conversational flows that are programmed into the bot. Typically, when a scenario is triggered by the health bot, the user completes a series of questions and answers until the scenario is complete. There are two types of scenarios: built-in and custom scenarios.
