Consider the employee safety scenario we've considered. The company has concerns about safety incidents on the factory floor, especially if a person is near a machine causing safety risks. So the company decided to deploy a real-time video analytics solution using existing security cameras. With the capabilities of Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge, the solution will run a machine learning model on your camera and detect a person at risk within a certain confidence level. Live Video Analytics(LVA) on IoT Edge lets you utilize your existing cameras to generate video feeds. You can build powerful hybrid applications by connecting LVA on IoT Edge with your custom edge modules or other Azure edge modules.
