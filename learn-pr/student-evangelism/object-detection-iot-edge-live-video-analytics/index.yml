title: "Object detection on Edge devices with Live Video Analytics using YOLO model"
summary: "Use a Live Video Analytics module to deploy a machine learning solution to an IoT Edge device. The solution will process a video feed from cameras and detect objects at the edge using a YOLO model to perform inferencing operations. Check that the solution is successfully deployed and test your solution from a web application."
abstract: |
    In this module, you will:  
    - Use Live Video Analytics module on IoT Edge module to build a video analytics solution
    - Deploy a set of modules to an IoT Edge virtual machine using the installer
    - Set up an application that uses a virtual device for rapid inference at the edge
    - Bring an AI model of your choice into the video analytics solution
    - Test a solution that will detect a person at the edge from a web application
