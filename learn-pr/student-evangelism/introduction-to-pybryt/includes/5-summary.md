In this module, you learned about PyBryt and how to create an assignment that can be assessed with PyBryt. You also built the scaffold for assessing student solutions for a Fibonacci sequence generator that provides specific feedback to students on where bugs may occur in their implementations.

Once you have a library of reference implementations built out, deploying PyBryt as a complete auto-assessment pipeline is a simple task. For example, you can set up GitHub Classroom assignments that use GitHub Actions to run PyBryt when students push to their repositories, providing swift feedback and while allowing you to collect the results for grading.

PyBryt is capable of much more than what is presented in this module. Besides providing logic for combining annotations, PyBryt can also be integrated with existing autograding pipelines such as [Otter-Grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/) and can be used for plagiarism detection.

You can learn more about PyBryt in its [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/pybryt/html/index.html) and find more examples in the [demo folder](https://github.com/microsoft/pybryt/tree/main/demo) in its GitHub repository.
