To properly understand JavaScript (the language that provides interactivity on the web), you first need to understand the language's data types and variables and how to create them. Most importantly, you need to understand when, where, and how to use them.

## Interactivity

By using variables, you'll be able to track state. Maybe you need to remember the value of a user's selection, or you need to save the result of a calculation. Situations like these call for the use of variables. 

Data types enhance your use of variables by allowing you to specify the shape and size of the data that you need to store. Data types might be expressed as numbers, strings, or even more complex structures.

If you've learned a programming language before, you might notice some similarities between that and JavaScript, although the syntax might be a bit different. If you're learning a programming language for the first time, don't worry. This module will break down JavaScript basics that will help you be successful as a web developer.
