Now that you're familiar with JavaScript's primitive data types, you have the basic tools needed to start populating variables in your code. With this knowledge, you can begin to think ahead to the ways developers make decisions in their code with these variables. You're on your way to developing your first dynamic website by using JavaScript!

## Try it!

To practice what you've learned, visit some of your favorite websites and consider the data types used throughout them. Try your best to identify an instance of a `string`, `number`, `bigint`, and `boolean` data type. Consider why and how these data types were used, and try writing and editing them in your browser's **Developer tools** console. Are some data types more common than others on different websites?
