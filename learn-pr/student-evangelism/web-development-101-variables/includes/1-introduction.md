A programming language consists of many concepts. You can use these concepts to create anything from a small command-line application to a large business system. Before you create an application, you need to know the fundamentals of a language. 

An important fundamental concept is *variables*. Your source code can have anywhere from ten lines to many thousands of lines and be spread out over hundreds of files. To better keep track of the flow of the program, you use variables. Variables are named references that help you keep track of important values in your program.

There are different types of values. You might want to change some and not others. Depending on what type of value you're dealing with, it should be stored as that type.

This module will explain the types of variables and their data types, along with how you can use them in JavaScript programming.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- What variables are and why you should use them.
- When to use constants.
- How storing your values as different types can create clarity in your code.
