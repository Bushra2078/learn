In our scenario, the Engineering team wanted to manage a group of solar panels remotely and securely. The team wanted to capture data from the solar panels. The data thus obtained would be used for the maintenance of the panels and for creating new business applications.  To solve this business problem, the Engineering team deployed Azure Sphere to manage the solar panels. Data was captured and transmitted securely. Guardian modules were used to manage legacy (brownfield) devices. Without the use of Azure Sphere, it would be hard to guarantee end to end security. Thus, the use of Azure Sphere enables the engineering team to create a secure platform to capture data from which they can deploy IoT analytics.
