IoT Hub is a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages.  To communicate with IoT devices through the cloud at scale, IoT Hub comprises a set of components that work together to solve business problems.

**The telemetry function** is the essential component of the IoT Hub. The telemetry function simply involves recording and transmitting values received by an IoT device. However, IoT Hub is much more than the basic telemetry function.  The **scaling function** of the IoT hub allows you to ramp up (or down) the scope of the solution.  The ability to scale an application depends on two considerations:   the features you plan to use and the amount of data you plan to move daily. Once you plan to deploy devices at scale, you need to manage these devices. The **provisioning function** of IoT hub enables you to manage devices across the lifecycle of a device. Provisioning also establishes the security protocols for the device, its access rights and privileges.  The security requirements can be seen as part of a **security function**, which manages the per-device authentication and access requirements with multiple authentication types. Based on the security functions, the **routing function** determines the message flow and the recipients of the message. Finally, you can connect to external devices natively using the **SDK functionality** and integrate with other services using the **service integration functionality**.

If you consider the scenario outlined before about application developers working with multiple sensors in the city – the prototype would have started with a basic telemetry function. But to deploy citywide – many more elements are needed. These include the ability to deploy and provision devices at scale, implement device level security and ensure message level routing. Due to the diversity of devices in a city, the ability to connect natively using an SDK will expand the user base of the application.  In the absence of the functionality from IoT Hub, the application would be hard to deploy beyond a basic telemetry function.
