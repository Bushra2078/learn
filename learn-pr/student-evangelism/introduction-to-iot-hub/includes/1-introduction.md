For large enterprises, deploying and managing IoT devices across diverse geographies can be challenging. You need to ensure that a range of devices connect together to create a solution that solves a business problem at scale. The IoT requirements of a large enterprise extend beyond basic telemetry (that is, the process of recording and transmitting the data values recorded by an IoT device). As an enterprise running cloud-based applications, how do you track and maintain the data coming in from all these devices? How do you ensure that only the right devices talk to each other? How do you secure the solution? How can the solution scale and be available as per service level requirements? Besides, you need to connect a range of devices over a variety of communication protocols. You also need to manage the life cycle of the devices from provisioning to ongoing management.

IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. IoT Hub's capabilities help you address these questions and to create scalable, full-featured IoT solutions to solve problems in domains such as manufacturing and healthcare. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build reliable and secure IoT solutions connection millions of IoT devices through a cloud-hosted solution.

Suppose you're an application developer working for your local city. Your city currently has sensors and cameras deployed throughout it. To manage these devices, you need a central messaging hub for bi-directional communication in the cloud. You'll need to authenticate, manage, and provision millions of devices reliably and securely. Additionally, you'll need to monitor the health of these devices over time to ensure constant uptime.  You can use Azure IoT Hub-based solution to deploy, manage, and scale these devices in the cloud to effectively address the given problem scenario.
