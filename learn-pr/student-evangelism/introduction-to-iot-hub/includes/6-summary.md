Consider the sample smart city scenario we have considered. The city is trying to optimise traffic using data from sensors and cameras. The solution needs to extend beyond the basic telemetry service. You need a central messaging hub for bi-directional communication in the cloud. You'll need to authenticate, manage, and provision millions of devices reliably and securely. Additionally, you'll need to monitor the health of these devices over time to ensure constant uptime. In this situation, IoT Hub can help solve the developer's problem because IoT Hub provides the framework to create supporting functions such as security, provisioning, and so on. 

In the absence of the IoT Hub, the developer would have to create all the functionality themselves. By using IoT Hub, you can focus on the business problem at hand (providing city-wide solutions).  IoT Hub simplifies the IoT Solution development by providing critical functionalities of any IoT solution in any vertical.
