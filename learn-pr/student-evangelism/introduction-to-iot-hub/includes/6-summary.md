Consider the sample smart city scenario we have considered. The developer creates an application that is used potentially by all the residents in the city. The developer must accept connections securely from different kinds of devices and provision and manage the application across these devices. The application must integrate with a diverse set of third-party services. 

In this situation, IoT Hub can help solve the developerâ€™s problem because IoT Hub provides the framework to create supporting functions such as security, provisioning and so on.

In the absence of the IoT Hub, the developer would have to create all the functionality themselves. By using IoT Hub, you can focus on the business problem at hand (providing city-wide applications).
