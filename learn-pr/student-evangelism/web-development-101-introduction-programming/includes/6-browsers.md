Running your programs on the internet requires some sort of client to help you view the output. A common form of client is a web browser, with which you can view and interact with the content. 

## Browsers for developers

Web developers rely on browsers to observe how their code runs on the web. Browsers are also used to view visual elements of a webpage that are written in the editor in languages such as HTML.

### Developer tools

Many browsers come with developer tools that contain helpful features and information to assist developers with collecting and capturing important insights about their applications. For example, if a webpage has errors, it's sometimes helpful to know when they occurred. Developer tools in a browser can be configured to capture this information.

Here are some popular browsers and developer tools:
