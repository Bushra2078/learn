PyBryt is an open-source Python library that aims to help the process of providing specific feedback to students without the need of instructor intervention while the student works through an assignment. It is an auto-assessment framework that examines a student's solution to some problem to determine its correctness and provide targeted messages about specific implementation details by comparing it to one or more reference implementations provided by the instructor. In this way, students can get the same helpful hints and pointers automatically rather than needing to meet with an instructor.

This module is a follow-up to the [Introduction to PyBryt](../introduction-pybryt/) module and covers more advanced topics that build on the information presented in the first module.

## What will you learn?

In this module, you'll learn about options for configuring annotations, combining annotations with relational annotations, and checking the time complexity of student code. You'll also learn about how PyBryt can be incorporated in a grading pipeline.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to write reference implementations that implement complex logic for assessing student submissions and you'll understand how to build out a pipeline for grading submissions.
