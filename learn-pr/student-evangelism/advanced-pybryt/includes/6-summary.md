In this module, you learned how to customize annotations in [PyBryt](https://microsoft.github.io/pybryt/html/index.html) and how to create relational and time complexity annotations. You also learned about creating a grading pipeline for assignments with PyBryt.

PyBryt's annotations can be grouped together in various ways to allow you to provide more cohesive feedback to students, and to provide more structure to assignments. You can combine annotations into relational annotations, which assert conditions on how annotations are satisfied. PyBryt can also be used to check the complexity of students' code, allowing you to create annotations that require a certain time complexity.

PyBryt is capable of more than what is presented in this module. Besides other kinds of annotations, PyBryt can also be integrated with existing autograding pipelines such as [Otter-Grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/) and can be used for plagiarism detection.

You can learn more about PyBryt in its [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/pybryt/html/index.html) and find more examples in the [demos folder](https://github.com/microsoft/pybryt/tree/main/demo) in its GitHub repository.
