Sometimes things go wrong. You might forget to add a new file, or add one by mistake. Perhaps you made a spelling error in your latest commit, or you committed something you didn't intend to. Perhaps you accidentally _deleted_ a file.

Git lets you make changes fearlessly, because it *always* offers a way to get back to where you were. You can even change Git's commit history as long as you only change commits that haven't been shared.

## Amend a commit with `--amend` flag

In the previous exercise, you modified the path to the style sheet in **index.html**. Suppose you discover that you made an error. Rather than type this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/site.css">
```

You typed this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assest/site.css">
```

When you refresh the page in your browser, you notice that your CSS style sheet isn't applied. After investigating, you see why.

So you update **index.html** with the correct path to the style sheet. At this point, you could simply commit the corrected version of **index.html**, but instead, you prefer to put it in the same commit as the original. The `--amend` option to `git commit` lets you change history (and how often does one get the chance to change history?):

```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

The `--no-edit` option tells Git to make the change without changing the commit message. You can also use `--amend` to edit a commit message, to add files accidentally left out of the commit, or to remove files that were added by mistake.

The ability to change history is one of Git's most powerful features. As with most power tools, it has to be used carefully. In particular, it's a bad idea to change any commits that have been shared with another developer or were published in a shared repository such as GitHub.

## Recover a deleted file with `git checkout`

Imagine you made a change to a source-code file that broke the entire project, so you want to revert to the previous version of that file. Or perhaps you accidentally deleted a file altogether. Git makes it easy to retrieve an earlier version, even if the current version no longer exists. Your best friend in this situation is the [`git checkout`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) command.

`git checkout` has multiple uses, but in the next exercise, we're going to use it to recover a deleted file. `git checkout` will update files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree.

If you've accidentally deleted a file, you can recover it by bringing the version from the index back into the working tree using this command

```bash
git checkout -- <file_name>
```

You can also check out a file from an earlier commit (typically the head of another branch), but the default is to get the file out of the index. The `--` in the argument list serves to separate the commit from the list of file paths. It's not strictly needed in this case, but if you had a branch named <file_name> (perhaps because that's the name of the file being worked on in that branch), `--` would prevent Git from getting confused.

> Later, you will learn that `checkout` is also used for switching branches.

## Recover files with `git reset`

Git also allows you to delete a file with `git rm`. This not only deletes the file on your disk, but has Git record the file deletion in the index.

So, if you ran:

```bash
git rm index.html
git checkout -- index.html
```

Git would _not_ happily restore **index.html**! Instead, you'd get an error like

```output
error: pathspec 'index.html' did not match any file(s) known to git.
```

To recover **index.html** we would have to use a different technique - `git reset`. `git reset` can be used to unstage changes.

You could recover **index.html** with these two commands:

```bash
git reset HEAD index.html
git checkout -- index.html
```

Here, `git reset` unstages the file deletion from Git. This brings the file back to the index, but the file is still deleted on disk. You can then restore it to the disk from the index using `git checkout`.

Here's another "Aha!" moment for new Git users. Many version-control systems make files read-only to ensure that only one person at a time can make changes; they use a completely unrelated `checkout` command to get a writable version. They also use `checkin` for an operation similar to what Git does with a combination of `add`, `commit`, and `push`. This occasionally causes confusion when people start using Git.

## Revert a commit with `git revert`

The last important command to know for fixing mistakes with Git is `git revert`. `git checkout` only works in situations where the changes to undo are just in the index. Once you've committed changes, you need to employ a different strategy to undo them. In this case we can use `git revert` to revert our previous commit. It works by making _another_ commit canceling out the first one.

We can use `git revert HEAD` to make an exact _opposite_ commit of our last commit, undoing it, while leaving all history intact. The `HEAD` part of the command just tells Git that we only want to "undo" the very last commit.

As an aside, you can also remove the most recent commit with the `git reset` command like this:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

There are several types of resets. The default is `--mixed`, which resets the index but not the working tree; it also moves HEAD if you specify a different commit. The `--soft` option only moves HEAD, and leaves both the index and the working tree unchanged. This leaves all your changes as "changes to be committed", as `git status` would put it. A `--hard` reset changes both the index and the working tree to match the specified commit; any changes you made to tracked files are simply discarded.
