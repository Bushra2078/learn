Before you can create your first repo, you make sure Git is installed and configured. Git comes preinstalled with Azure Cloud Shell, so we can use Git in Cloud Shell to the right.

## Configure Git

1. To double check that Git is installed, type `git --version`.

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

    [!include[](../../../includes/azure-cloudshell-copy-paste-tip.md)]

1. You should see output that looks something like:

    ```output
    git version 2.7.4
    ```

1. To configure Git, you must define some global variables: `user.name` and `user.email`. Both are required for commits.

1. Set your name in Cloud Shell with this command, replacing `<USER_NAME>` with the user name you wish to use (for example, "Shana"):

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "<USER_NAME>"
    ```

1. Now use this command to create a `user.email` configuration variable, replacing `<USER_EMAIL>` with your e-mail address:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "<USER_EMAIL>"
    ```

1. Now execute the following command to check that your changes worked:

    ```bash
    git config --list
    ```

1. Confirm that the output includes four lines similar to the following. Your name and e-mail address will be different, of course:

    ```output
    user.name=Shana
    user.email=shana@email.com
    ```

## Set up your Git repository

Git works by checking for changes to files within a certain folder.  We will create a folder to serve as our *working tree* (project directory), and let Git know about it so it can start tracking changes. We do this by initializing a Git repository into that folder.

Start by creating an empty project directory and initializing a Git repository
inside it.

1. Create a folder named "Cats". This will be the *working tree* (sometimes called a "project directory") where your Web site is stored and the files that comprise it are located.

    ```bash
    mkdir Cats
    ```

1. `cd` to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd Cats
    ```

1. Then execute a `git init`command to initialize the repository:

     ```bash
     git init
     ```

1. Now use a `git status` command to show the status of the working tree:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

    Git responds by saying "nothing to commit." It also says "On branch master" indicating that "master" is the current branch. (It's also the only branch.) So far, so good.

1. Use an `ls` command to show the contents of the working tree:

    ```bash
    ls -a
    ```

    Confirm that the directory contains a subdirectory named ".git." (Using the `-a` option with `ls` is important, because Linux normally hides file and directory names that start with a period.) This is the Git *repository* â€” the directory in which Git stores metadata and history for the working tree.

You typically don't do anything with the ".git" directory directly. Git updates the metadata there as the status of the working tree changes to keep track of whats changed in your files. This directory is hands-off for you, but it's incredibly important to Git.

## Getting help from Git

Git, like most command line tools has a built-in help function you can use to look up commands and keywords.

1. Type the following command to get help with what you can do with Git:

    ```bash
    git --help
    ```

1. This will display the following output:

    ```output
    usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

    These are common Git commands used in various situations:

    start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
       clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
       init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

    work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
       add        Add file contents to the index
       mv         Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
       reset      Reset current HEAD to the specified state
       rm         Remove files from the working tree and from the index

    examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
       bisect     Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
       grep       Print lines matching a pattern
       log        Show commit logs
       show       Show various types of objects
       status     Show the working tree status

    grow, mark and tweak your common history
       branch     List, create, or delete branches
       checkout   Switch branches or restore working tree files
       commit     Record changes to the repository
       diff       Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
       merge      Join two or more development histories together
       rebase     Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head
       tag        Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

    collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
       fetch      Download objects and refs from another repository
       pull       Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
       push       Update remote refs along with associated objects

    'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
    concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
    to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
    ```

Read through the different options available with Git and note that each command comes with it's own help page, for when you start digging deeper. Not all of these commands will make sense yet, but some may look familiar if you've used other version control systems in the past.

In the next lesson, you learn more about the commands you just tried, and the basics of Git.
