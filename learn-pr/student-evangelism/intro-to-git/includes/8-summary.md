Congratulations! In this module, you learned the basics of using Git.

You learned:

- how to configure Git
- how to create repositories
- how to track changes
- how to recover from simple mistakes with Git
- differences between Git and GitHub

At this point, you know enough about Git to use version control by yourself on a little project. Where version control shines is collaboration with other developers. Check out the other modules in this Learning Path for more on using Git with others!

If you would like to dig deeper, here are additional resources that you'll find helpful:

- On the command line, `git help tutorial` and `git help tutorial-2`
- [Everyday Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/everyday?azure-portal=true) (also available from the command line, as `git help everyday`)
- GitHub's [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources?azure-portal=true)

You can also learn more from the [documentation section](https://git-scm.com/doc?azure-portal=true) of [Git's official Web site](https://git-scm.com?azure-portal=true).
