quiz:
  questions:
    - content: 'Which of the following expressions will output the array "any_numbers" in standard units?'
      choices:
        - content: 'np.stdu(any_numbers)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: '(any_numbers - np.mean(any_numbers))/np.std(any_numbers)'
          explanation: Correct.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: 'any_numbers/np.std(any_numbers)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'Which of the following qualities is not what the correlation coefficient represents?'
      choices:
        - content: 'How tightly clustered a scatter diagram is about a straight line'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'The strength and direction of linear association'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'The strength and direction of association'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: The correlation coefficient only represents the strength of linear association, not all associations.
    - content: 'How do you calculate the correlation coefficient between variables x and y?'
      choices:
        - content: 'np.average(x*y)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect.'
        - content: 'np.average(((x-np.mean(x))/np.std(x)) * ((y-np.mean(y))/np.std(y)))'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.
        - content: '((x-np.mean(x))/np.std(x)) * ((y-np.mean(y))/np.std(y))'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
