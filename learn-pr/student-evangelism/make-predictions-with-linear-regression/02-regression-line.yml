content: 'The water table contains one row per country with data from 2014. The OBS_VALUE column represents the approximate price of a 1.5 liter bottle of mineral water in that country, and the mm_precipitation column represents the average precipitation in that country (in millimeters). The next table below contains calculations from the water table.
