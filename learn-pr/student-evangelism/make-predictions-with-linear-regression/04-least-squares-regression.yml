  title: Check your Knowledge
  questions:
    - content: 'which of the following is incorrect?'
      choices:
        - content: 'We can calculate a "best fit" regression line by minimizing the mean error.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. We should be minimizing the root mean squared error instead.
        - content: 'The least squares method is a way to generate a regression line.'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'No matter what the shape of the scatter plot, there is a unique line that minimizes the mean squared error of estimation.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'which of the following is correct?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Linear correlation implies causation.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'Causation implies linear correlation.'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'The regression line is the only line that minimizes mean squared error.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.
