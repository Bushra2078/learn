In this module, we studied one of the most commonly used ways of predicting the value of one variable based on the value of another – Linear Regression – and studied the concept of correlation.

We have covered much ground in this module and here are some of the topics you did in the module.

- Learn about Correlation as a measure of linear association and the correlation coefficient.
- Understand the Regression line, Regression Effect, and the equation of the regression line.
- Motivate The Method of Least Squares, Least Square Regression, & Nonlinear Regression
- Understand Residuals and residual diagnostics through residual plots.

Linear regression is a simple, yet surprisingly effective and extremely popular, method for predictions. And with the knowledge gained in this module you can now make linear (or even nonlinear with the right features) prediction models for any dataset of choice.
