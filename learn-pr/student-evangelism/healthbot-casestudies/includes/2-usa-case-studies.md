Our partners are using the Azure Health Bot Service to build health bot instances that address a wide range of healthcare-specific use cases. For example:

- Insurers have built health bot instances that give their customers an easy way to look up the status of a claim and ask questions about benefits and services.

- Providers have built health bot instances that triage patient issues with a symptom checker, help patients find appropriate care, and look up nearby doctors.

A great showcase for  the impact of Health Bot to healthcare organizations, is it's wide use during the most challenging health crisis in decades, the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some of those partners in the United States of America are:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):

The CDC bot, which utilizes Microsoft's Healthcare Bot service, can quickly: 

- assess the symptoms and risk factors for people worried about infection,  

- provide information and suggest a next course of action such as contacting a medical provider  

- or, for those who do not need in-person medical care, managing the illness safely at home.
