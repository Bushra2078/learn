In this unit, you will learn how to deploy your own private MQTT Broker

## Why deploy your own Mosquitto MQTT Broker

The public **test.mosquitto.org** broker is great, but:

1. All data from the Altair emulator, Web Terminal, and Virtual Disk Server is publicly viewable on the MQTT Broker.
2. The MQTT broker performance varies depending on the number of users and MQTT messages being routed. This will likely impact on the performance and reliability of the Altair emulator

In the following exercise, you will learn how to install your own (and free) Mosquitto Broker.
