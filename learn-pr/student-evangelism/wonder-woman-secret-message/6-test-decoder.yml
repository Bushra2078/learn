  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  
  - content: "ASCII is a way to represent what characters as numbers?"
    choices:
    - content: "English letters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. English letters are represented as numbers in ASCII, but they aren't the only characters that are represented as numbers."
    - content: "Numbers 0-9"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Numbers 0-9 are represented as numbers in ASCII, but they aren't the only characters that are."
    - content: "Punctuation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Punctuation is represented as numbers in ASCII, but they aren't the only characters that are represented as numbers."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "English letters, numbers 0-9, and punctuation are all represented as numbers in ASCII."
  
  - content: "If you call your `lassoLetter()` function and pass in **p** as the `letter` parameter and **-2** as the `shiftAmount` parameter, what letter is returned?"
    choices:  
    - content: "`Error`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The code you wrote works with any whole number. If you pass in a negative number, the decoder function parses the word backwards."
    - content: "`o`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For a return value of **o**, you would pass in a `shiftAmount` of **-1**."
    - content: "`n`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The code you wrote takes the ASCII number value of **p** and adds **-2** to it, which basically subtracts 2!"
    - content: "`P`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The code you wrote can't convert a lowercase letter to upper case."
  
  - content: "The secret time and place inspired by the WONDER WOMAN 1984 film is when and where?"
    choices:  
    - content: "June in Washington, USA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Check your code again and make sure you put in your secret message correctly!"
    - content: "January in Montevideo, Uruguay"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Check your code again and make sure you put in your secret message correctly!"
    - content: "October in London, England"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Check your code again and make sure you put in your secret message correctly!"
    - content: "July in Washington, D.C., USA"
      isCorrect: true
