Here's the secret message that you need to decipher:

After our analysis in this module, here's what you need to do to decode the message:
1. The word "WHY" needs to be shifted by 13.
1. The word "oskza" needs to be shifted by -18.
1. The word "ohupo" needs to be shifted by -1.
1. The word "ED" needs to be shifted by 25.

## Add print statements

Just like when you tested your `lassoWord()` function on the word "terra" and shifted it by 13, you can add `print()` statements to the bottom of your ** decrypt.py** file to print all the decoded words.

```python
print( "Shifting WHY by 13 gives: \n" + lassoWord( "WHY", 13 ) )
print( "Shifting oskza by -18 gives: \n" + lassoWord( "oskza", -18 ) )
print( "Shifting ohupo by -1 gives: \n" + lassoWord( "ohupo", -1 ) )
print( "Shifting ED by 25 gives: \n" + lassoWord( "ED", 25 ) )
```

Now press the **Play** button. You should see the final clue to the true meeting place and time!
