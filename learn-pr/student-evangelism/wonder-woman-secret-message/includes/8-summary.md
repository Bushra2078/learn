With your **decrypt.py** file, you now have the ability to decode any secret message that uses the English alphabet. Your decoded messages will be in all lowercase, but that shouldn't take away from the meaning behind them.

Special thanks to [Audrey St. John from Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/people/audrey-stjohn?azure-portal=true) for the inspiration for this lesson! 

## Additional challenges for your decrypt code

As an added challenge, you can explore how to:
- Maintain casing for each letter throughout the decoding process.
- Create a function to read in an entire message without having to print each word individually.
- Modify your decoder to include numbers.

## Discover the next coding challenge

With the location and time of the next superhero meeting decoded, it's time to figure out which superhero you really are! In the next module in this learning path, you'll [create a test to determine your superpower with Python and Visual Studio Code](LINK TBD).
