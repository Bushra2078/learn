In this module we will discuss a few case studies for Microsoft's Health Bot Service. 

The Health Bot Service is a cloud platform that empowers developers in Healthcare organizations to build and deploy their compliant, AI-powered virtual health assistants and health bots, that help them improve processes and reduce costs.  

A study by Juniper Research found that chatbots could lead to cost savings of over $8 billion by 2020. Another survey published by research firm Statista, 27 percent of people would prefer to answer sensitive health questions posed by virtual assistants than by people. The research strongly indicates a great need for Microsoft's Health Bot framework, where customers don't have to start from scratch while implementing the Bot. On the contrary The Health Bot service has  medical intelligence and knowledge, such as a symptom-checker and information about conditions, medications, and procedures. It has language models trained to understand health care terminology. It understands if you are complaining or if you are asking about what doctor you should see or if you are thinking about side effects of a medication.
