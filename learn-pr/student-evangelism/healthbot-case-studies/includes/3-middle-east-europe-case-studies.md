The Azure Health Bot service empowers healthcare organizations to build and deploy an AI-powered, compliant, conversational healthcare experiences at scale. During the time of COVID-19 pandemic, it helped several nations like U.S.A, U.A.E, and Lebanon to give people access to trusted and relevant healthcare services and information. Let us look at some of the Covid-19 specific use cases.

## HUS

HUS the largest Healthcare provider in Finland serving over half a million patients annually, surfaced multiple use cases as part of a Virtual Health Village initiative, including an Acne Bot, Varicose vein Bot and bot to help with social issues.

## Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) in Lebanon 

The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) in Lebanon announced a Covid-19 Health bot 

It has been developed by trakMD, the Epidemiological Surveillance and E-Health teams of MoPH in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO).  

- This bot comes with an inbuilt symptom checker which simulates six scenarios allowing the people to take self-assessments to screen for potential infections.

- The Bot also has the capability to identify high risk patients aligned with the medical procedures and those are directed for further consultation and treatment in hospital facilities.

## Daman, UAE's leading national health insurance company

Daman collaborated with Microsoft to deploy the Daman Health Bot, an AI powered tool that will assist patients to conduct self-assessment on COVID-19 symptoms and guide them to the appropriate level of care.

- The Daman Health Bot is bilingual.

- It can provide expertise including patient assessment for the disease, triage and symptom checking, offering general medical information, and making medical recommendations.

- The health bot will ask patients a defined set of questions and follow specific protocols, and accordingly advise them to connect with Abu Dhabi Department of Health (DoH), UAE Ministry of Health & Prevention (MOHAP) and the Dubai Health Authority for further assistance.

## East Limburg Hospital (ZOL)

East Limburg Hospital (ZOL) in Genk, Belgium, started using the Health Bot. The solution was to draw up a questionnaire for patients, which resulted in the Health Bot (a chatbot dealing specifically with the patient's health). The questionnaire clarifies the likelihood that a patient may or may not be infected with the COVID-19 virus.

- It allows us to properly assess a potential new outbreak and take the necessary precautions. 

- Each questionnaire is linked to a patient file, so through patient reports the hospital can determine by how many orange, yellow or green patients there are per postcode.  

This procedure ensures a safer and more pleasant environment in the hospital for both patients and nursing staff. The risk of infection is greatly reduced by not allowing the green, yellow and orange patients to cross paths. This means that patients can once again get their necessary treatments with peace of mind.
