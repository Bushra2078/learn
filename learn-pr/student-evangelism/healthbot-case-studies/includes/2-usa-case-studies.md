Microsoft partners are using the Azure Health Bot service to build bots that address a wide range of healthcare-specific use cases. For example:

- Insurers have built bots that give their customers an easy way to look up the status of a claim and ask questions about benefits and services.
- Providers have built bots that triage patient issues with a symptom checker, help patients find appropriate care, and look up nearby doctors.

A great showcase for the impact of Health Bot to healthcare organizations is its wide use during the most challenging health crisis in decades, the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some of those partners in the United States are as follows.

## CDC

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bot, which utilizes the Azure Health Bot service, can quickly:

- Assess the symptoms and risk factors for people worried about infection.
- Provide information and suggest a course of action, such as contacting a medical provider.  
- Help those who don't need in-person medical care to manage the illness safely at home.
