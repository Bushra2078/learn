This module introduced you to the Azure Health Bot service and helped you to create your first scenario. You can now effectively create a basic scenario on your own. 

In this module, you learned that the canvas is a place to create and move blocks. Then you connect them to decide the flow of the bot. The **History** option shows a JSON format of the graphical steps.

This was a basic informative bot without any interrupting or breaking scenario involved. In a later  module - Enhanced healthcare bot - you learn how to enhance the bot with more advanced functionalities.
