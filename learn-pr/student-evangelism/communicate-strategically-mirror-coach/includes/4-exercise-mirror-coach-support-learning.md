After you work with the team as a mirror and a coach, you decide to explore both roles in more detail. This experience will help you and the team decide which role works better in different situations.

Growth and resilience in technology are necessary if you want to help a diverse community of computer science students and workers succeed. In your career, you can use mirroring and coaching to help people solve problems, build their resilience and team skills, and manage challenges better.

## Individual reflection

Review the following questions, think about your answers, and optionally, note them on a device or a piece of paper:

- Do you think you'll be more comfortable in one role or another (mirror versus coach)?
- Have you had anyone closely study your practice, for example, in sports, music, or another domain?
- Have you had someone record you? For example, has someone made a video of your presentation about a piece of code and analyzed it with you so that you could make changes? What was that experience like for you?
- Can you think of a time when you asked someone for help but they misunderstood where you were stuck in your process? Or maybe they misunderstood your goal?
- Have you approached someone for help with a problem and realized as they were giving feedback that there was a misunderstanding? Did you interrupt them, so they could better understand? Or did you continue to listen and thank them even though it didn't help you?
- How strong do you perceive your listening skills to be?
- Can you think of any cues that might indicate when you should ease away from mirroring and move more toward coaching?

## Scenario review

Review each of the following scenarios as the team prepares for the hackathon. Think of answers to the following questions for each scenario:

- Should you take on a mirror or coach role to help your teammate?
- What is the next step for you? What kind of question could be posed, or what type of action could be taken?

### Scenario 1

You're trying to help a team member with their coding. You can't tell if they don't know or just can't remember certain syntax. How do you proceed?

#### Suggested answer for scenario 1

Take on the coach role in this scenario. First try to figure out if the team member has previous experience with the syntax or if it's new to them. Then guide them to learning resources for the code they need help on. Ask them, "Have you tried this tutorial? Many people have found it helpful. It provides some great tips on this syntax."

### Scenario 2

You're reviewing the code for a program that a team member has completed. The program runs. But when you review it closely, you notice some challenges they might face when they try to upgrade it over the next few weeks to meet hackathon requirements. How can you maximize the support you can provide them during your meeting this week?

#### Suggested answer for scenario 2

Take on the coach role with this team member. Before your meeting, prepare some notes with information about the hackathon requirements they'll need to meet and the changes they'll need to make to their program. Together, you can consider alternative strategies and steps to take. Talk about similar challenges that other teammates overcame and outline the steps they tried.

### Scenario 3

A team member wants to discuss some of the code you reviewed with the team earlier in the week. You ask them to tell you what they understand so far. The team member's face goes blank. They say, "That's the thing. I don't get any of it." What might you do next?

#### Suggested answer for scenario 3

Take on the mirror role with this team member. Review with them their understanding of the code that the team worked on before this session. Let them walk you through the steps they took to work on their code so far and try to point out where they're stuck. Ask them to walk you through their program so that you can review if there are any issues with it that are impeding their progress.

### Scenario 4

A team member who is working on a code assignment is stuck at a particular place. They say, "I've got these parts working. I've isolated this as the problem area." How can you use a whiteboard or a device to help the team member?

#### Suggested answer for scenario 4

Take on the mirror role with this team member. Create a flowchart or diagram to represent the code logic and separate the parts that are working from the one that isn't. Then walk through how the parts connect to each other and the order in which they appear in the program. Ask the team member to retrace their steps to figure out what went wrong with the part that isn't working and take steps to fix the issue.
