*Mindset* is a self-perception, or *self-theory*, that people hold about themselves. A *growth mindset* is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through perseverance and hard work. Growth mindset is important in tech because it's crucial to learning. The view you adopt about yourself affects the way you lead your life. 

Imagine that you're working as a coder on a web-development team. You've been writing challenging code for the team website. You feel frustrated, and you question whether you're cut out to be in technology. When you make mistakes you think, "Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected?" Every situation seems to call for a confirmation of intelligence, personality, or character. It's increasingly difficult to work on the project when the progress you expected isn't happening and when it feels like you're consumed by the goal of proving yourself.

A trusted colleague suggests that you might have a fixed mindset. They suggest that you should learn methods to change your mindset to a growth mindset. Your colleague tells you that having a growth mindset might help you approach your project strategically.

In this module, you'll learn about and identify fixed and growth mindsets, and about how inner dialogue influences mindset.
