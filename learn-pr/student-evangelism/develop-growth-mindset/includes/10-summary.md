In this module, you learned about fixed and growth mindsets. You've discovered that your mindset is important because it affects the way you lead your life.

You explored how to use metacognition to recognize when you have a fixed mindset and change it to a growth mindset. For example, when you have a limiting thought such as, “I can’t do this,” you know to replace it with an empowering one, such as “I can’t do this…*yet*.”

When faced with a challenging project or task, you discovered that having a growth mindset can help you learn new skills or recover from setbacks. You also learned that making mistakes is a necessary part of learning.

You also explored new ways to approach challenges. These include asking a peer or a mentor for help and celebrating your progress rather than expecting perfection.

A growth mindset can help you empathize with the mindsets of others and help you support them. Now when you provide feedback to your peers, you can do so in a way that supports their growth mindset.
