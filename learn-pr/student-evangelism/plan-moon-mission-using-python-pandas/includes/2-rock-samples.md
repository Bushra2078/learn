Moon rocks are a huge part of the scientific discovery and understanding of our universe and planet. They can tell us about how planets and moons were formed and guide us as we prepare for further space exploration. 

NASA's [Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/) has the list of all extraterrestrial samples from the Moon and much more, this module will focus on those collected from the Moon. Across the six Apollo missions that landed humans on the Moon, and the three Luna missions that landed robotic probes onto the Moon, we've successfully returned 383 kilograms (over 800 pounds) of rocks, soil, core samples. All of these samples have been categorized and photographed and are available to view on the [NASA Lunar Sample and Photo Catalog](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/samplecatalog/index.cfm).

This catalog is not just interesting for the casual space enthusiast, but critical to active researchers and educational institutions who might be inspiring the next generation of space rock scientists. You can actually request samples for [research](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/sampreq/requests.cfm), [education](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/education/index.cfm), or [public displays](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/education/public_display.cfm). The challenge for the curation office then is to make sure that there is enough sample of different kinds of lunar matter to continue the collective understanding of our universe and planet. 

This is especially difficult for two reasons:
1. We cannot simply send an astronaut up to the Moon to collect a bit more of a particular type of rock. 
2. When astronauts do land on the Moon again, it is sometimes difficult for them to identify specifically what type of sample they are collecting. 

Moon rock samples go through a thorough analysis and cleansing done by experts here on Earth and it is the curators who develop an understanding of what samples they have, what requests for samples they get, and what is the most challenging part of ensuring research can continue. This module begins to explore how you can use data and a bit of Python coding to come up with an understanding of what we have, and make recommendations for what the next pair of astronauts should look for when they land on the Moon again as part of the Artemis program in 2024. 

Before continuing, make sure you spend time going through the [Lunar Sample and Photo Catalog](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/samplecatalog/index.cfm) because, while this module will focus on weights, types, and number of samples per Apollo mission, there are a lot of other details that you could use to expand on the analysis and therefore develop even better recommendations for the astronauts.
