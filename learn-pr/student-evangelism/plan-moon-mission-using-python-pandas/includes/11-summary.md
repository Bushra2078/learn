You've watched Fei Fei design, prototype, test, and ultimately succeed at creating a rocket that launched her to the Moon. And you've experienced a taste of what NASA scientists and engineers might analyze to determine how to account for every ounce of weight on a rocket. It's now clear why data-science skills and practices are so critical to space exploration. 

NASA might have a lot more information and clearer standards than we can decipher online for this analysis, but the exploration and understanding of data from multiple sources is pervasive throughout many other industries as well. This means that you can apply the knowledge and skills you've acquired in the journey you just completed to solving countless other problems. 

In this module, you have:
- Gathered information about samples brought back from the Moon via the Apollo missions.
- Acquired data about the types of spacecraft and rockets used for the Apollo and upcoming Artemis missions.
- Compiled DataFrames, or tables, of that data, which tells stories and provides insights.
- Created a prediction of how much sample weight could be returned from the Artemis missions.
- Made a recommendation for the amount and types of rocks the Artemis astronauts should focus their efforts on, based on the rocks that are currently being used for research here on Earth.

The data journey can take many turns. With your new data-wrangling skills, you should feel empowered to find other datasets or cut the data that's used here in new ways. By doing so, you'll discover and uncover new information about space exploration and Moon sample recovery, or about any other problem you might be interested in.

This module is part of a multimodal learning experience. [Follow along with a video walkthrough of the module in a new tab](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG?azure-portal=true).

And with that, Fei Fei ends her journey to the Moon.
