Passion, determination, creativity, and persistence are the qualities necessary to go beyond what we think is possible. These are the qualities and skills that have propelled humans into space and that have driven Fei Fei to reach the Moon in a rocket she designs in the new movie [*Over the Moon*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26DIABx44Tw?azure-portal=true) on Netflix. When it comes to Moon missions, whether you're Fei Fei or a NASA engineer, the most critical step is preparation.

In the film, we see Fei Fei focus on ensuring a safe flight to the Moon. She starts with what she knows: fireworks, model rockets, and inventions of her own. She works through the math on paper and tests her hypothesis with scaled-down versions of the rocket she will eventually use to fly into space. She takes inspiration from what is around her to finally design a rocket that uses magnets to deliver enough speed and thrust to launch her into the sky. She then relies on fireworks to give her the last push through our atmosphere.

Her calculations are precise, she takes into account her and Bungee's weight, and she remembers to bring food and a way to even use the restroom! Everything she does to prepare for her journey into space is what real engineers and scientists do all around the world. We can see similarities with NASA's Apollo missions, which were the first to land humans on the Moon. 

The challenge that Fei Fei runs into is one of weight: she hasn't taken into account an unexpected companion, Chin. Chin sneaks onto her rocket just before takeoff, and his extra weight completely throws off her calculations, making it impossible to reach the Moon. We saw this in real life too, during Apollo 13, when one of the five engines stopped two minutes early. While Fei Fei had extra weight, the Apollo 13 crew lost thrust. The result can be the same: not enough thrust-to-weight ratio to break through Earth's atmosphere. 

NASA, however, did have a lot more contingency plans to ensure the safety of its astronauts. Luckily, the rocket could still reach space without that last push from the fifth engine. The Apollo 13 onboard crew and on-Earth team had a number of challenges ahead of them; but one thing was always true: they were determined to ensure the safety of the astronauts, even if that meant changing the final plan and not landing on the Moon.

Fei Fei, on the other hand, still was able to land on the Moon, with the help of some of Chang'e's friends. Her mission was not only to find Chang'e, but also to prove to her father that Chang'e exists and that true, eternal love is real. The brave astronauts who have landed on the Moon have done something similar for us here on Earth. They have brought back samples of Moon rock, soil, and core to help us get one step closer to understanding how our universe, Earth, and life began. 

In this module, you will take inspiration from both Fei Fei and NASA scientists to explore data related to the Apollo missions and the rock samples that were returned to Earth. You will learn data cleansing and manipulation techniques that are critical to developing the machine learning models and AI that aid humankind in preparation for space exploration.

This module is part of a multi-modal approach to learning, which means that you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr. G Learn TV video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG?azure-portal=true).

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will begin to develop the skills to: 

- Create a clear representation of data from many sources.
- Use Python and pandas to explore data. 
- Use data cleansing techniques to get a clear representation of data.
- Hypothesize how much rock sample astronauts might bring back on the Artemis missions.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code, with the Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/learntocode/?utm_source=MSLearn&utm_medium=direct&utm_campaign=PartnerLessons?azure-portal=true)
- A local Python environment set up, as seen in [Discover the role of Python in space exploration](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/introduction-python-space-exploration-nasa/)
