quiz:
  content: "For the following questions, a die (singular form of 'dice') means a fair, 6-sided die, with the sides having values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The chance of an outcome for one roll doesn't depend on outcomes of any previous or future rolls."
  title: Check your Knowledge
  questions:
    - content: 'Wilton rolls a die four times. What are the chances that all four rolls are a 5?'
      choices:
        - content: '1/6'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: '4/6'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: '(1/6)^4'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct, the probability of rolling a 5 in 1 roll is 1/6, and we want that to happen four times, so it's (1/6)*(1/6)*(1/6)*(1/6).
    - content: 'Wilton rolls a die four times. What are the chances that all four rolls are the same value?'
      choices:
        - content: '(1/6)^4'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: '(1/6)^3'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'P(all four rolls are the same value) = P(all four rolls are 1)+P(all four rolls are 2)+P(all four rolls are 3)+P(all four rolls are 4)+P(all four rolls are 5)+P(all four rolls are 6) = 6*(1/6)^4 = (1/6)^3 '
        - content: '(6/6)^4'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'Wilton rolls a die four times. What are the chances that at least two of the values are different?'
      choices:
        - content: '1-(1/6)^4'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: '1-(1/6)^3'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'P(at least two of the values are different) = 1- P(all four rolls are the same value) by the compliment rule '
        - content: '1-(6/6)^4'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'Suppose you roll two 6-sided fair dice, what is the probability that at least one of the two dice shows a 6?'
      choices:
        - content: '(1/6)^2'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: '(1/6)+(1/6)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect
        - content: '11/36'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: P(at least one of the two dice shows a 6) = P(first dice shows a 6) + P(second dice shows a 6) - P(both dice shows a 6) = (1/6)+(1/6)-(1/36)
