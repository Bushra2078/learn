We created our protype, which enables us to visualize how our project would look like as well as the tools we would need to bring it to life. In this section, we cover how we can narrow down on the key features for our product and build a Minimal Viable Product. A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is the simplest version of your product your users can use.

An MVP is a tangible product that you can use to test and validate your prototype with customers.

## Step 1: Use Bing Chat to narrow down your product features

In this step, we will ask Bing Chat to suggest some features we can build for our product.

### Steps

1. Copy the sample prompt provided below and make any edits you want
2. Paste it into Bing chat

### Sample Prompt

_Hey Bing, from what I have shared so far about my idea, I now want to implement and start building. Can you help me narrow down the main features my product should have?_

### Sample Response

_Hello, this is Bing. I'm happy to hear that you want to implement and start building your idea. I can help you narrow down the main features your product should have. Based on what you have shared so far about your idea, here are some possible main features:_

_A feature that allows the user to register and manage their devices, such as sensors, cameras, drones, and satellites. The user should be able to add, edit, delete, and configure their devices according to their needs and preferences._

_A feature that enables the user to view and monitor the data collected from their devices, such as the location, status, battery level, and signal strength of each device. The user should also be able to access the live or recorded video or audio feed from their cameras or drones._

_A feature that leverages AI to analyze and process the data from the devices, such as detecting, identifying, and tracking wildlife and human activities and threats. The feature should also use AI to generate insights and predictions based on the data, such as the behavior, movement, and population of wildlife and the risk, impact, and trend of human-wildlife conflict._

_A feature that utilizes AI to provide alerts, recommendations, or interventions to the user based on the data and insights. The feature should also allow the user to customize the type, frequency, and mode of the alerts, recommendations, or interventions. For example, the user can choose to receive a text message, a phone call, or a push notification when an alert is triggered. The user can also choose to accept, reject, or modify a recommendation or an intervention._

_A feature that enables the user to generate and download reports based on the data and insights. The feature should also allow the user to select the time period, the format, and the content of the reports. For example, the user can choose to generate a weekly, monthly, or yearly report in PDF, Excel, or PowerPoint format. The user can also choose to include the summary, the details, or the graphs of the data and insights._

_I hope these main features help you with your implementation and building. If you need more assistance, please let me know. ðŸ˜Š_

But before we focus on each feature separately, let us ask Bing chat to help identify the tools and services we will need to put this together.

## Step 2: Select a feature and flesh out more details on implementation

In this step, we select one of the features and brainstorm with Bing Chat how we can have it implemented and the tools we may need. This will start preparing us to understand the workload that is ahead of you to bring this idea to life.

Now let's focus on each feature/ functionality separately.

### Steps for a specific feature

1. Copy the sample prompt provided below and make any edits you want
2. Paste it into Bing chat

### Sample Prompt for a specific feature

_We are building a wildlife AI system. How can we create a dashboard for users to view and manage the data collected? In addition, suggest which tools/ frameworks/ languages we need to successfully build our application. Summarize the response in bullet points._

### Sample Response for a specific feature

_To create a dashboard for users to view and manage the data collected from your wildlife AI system, you can follow these steps:_

_Choose a suitable IoT platform that can handle the data collection, processing, visualization, and device management. [For example, you can use AWS IoT, Azure IoT, Google Cloud IoT, or ThingsBoard](https://bing.com/search?q=tools+and+frameworks+for+IoT+and+AI+development)[1](https://bing.com/search?q=tools+and+frameworks+for+IoT+and+AI+development)._
