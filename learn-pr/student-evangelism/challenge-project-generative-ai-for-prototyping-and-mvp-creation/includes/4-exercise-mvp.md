We created our protype, which enables us to visualize how our project would look like as well as the tools we would need to bring it to life. In this section, we cover how we can narrow down on the key features for our product and build a Minimal Viable Product. A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is the simplest version of your product your users can use.

An MVP is a tangible product that you can use to test and validate your prototype with customers.

## Step 1: Use Bing Chat to narrow down your product features

In this step, we will ask Bing Chat to suggest some features we can build for our product.

### Steps

1. Copy the sample prompt provided below and make any edits you want
2. Paste it into Bing chat

### Sample Prompt

```
Hey Bing, from what I have shared so far about my idea, I now want to implement and start building. Can you help me narrow down the main features my product should have?
```

### Sample Response
![Project features](./media/poject-features.png)

But before we focus on each feature separately, let us ask Bing chat to help identify the tools and services we will need to put this together.

### Sample Prompt on tools/services for our project

```
Thanks for the help so far. To successfully implement these features, which tools/ services will I need to get? Please use a list and respond in short bullet points and categorize the tools per feature/ functionality.
```

### Sample Response on tools/services for our project

## Step 2: Select a feature and flesh out more details on implementation

In this step, we select one of the features and brainstorm with Bing Chat how we can have it implemented and the tools we may need. This will start preparing us to understand the workload that is ahead of you to bring this idea to life.

Now let's focus on each feature/ functionality separately.

### Steps for a specific feature

1. Copy the sample prompt provided below and make any edits you want
2. Paste it into Bing chat

### Sample Prompt for a specific feature

```
We are building a wildlife AI system. How can we create a dashboard for users to view and manage the data collected? In addition, suggest which tools/ frameworks/ languages we need to successfully build our application. Summarize the response in bullet points.
```

### Sample Response for a specific feature

Bing will give us an overview of the different tools we may need to ensure we successfully implement a product. We can ask Bing for ideas on how we can use this in the project as follows:

> [!NOTE]
>If you're a student, you can have 100USD free Azure credits to use it in your technology. Learn more about it, [at Azure for Studens](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-114050-bethanycheum).
> If you're new to azure, you can sign in and try azure for 30-days, register [at Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=academic-114050-bethanycheum)

Repeat step 2 for each feature until you have a clear understanding of how you can build the final product.

## Step 4: Now to the exciting part: Building our MVP.

You now have a proper guide to the technical requirements to implement your project. Next step is for you (and your team) to start building. Bing chat has helped us identify tools that you would need to install, so a good flow of events from here would be:

1. Review your sketch designs to ensure that you are clear on what you are building
2. Set up your local or virtual developer environment such as [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces?WT.mc_id=academic-114050-bethanycheum) to begin the project

### [Optional] Keep working with Bing chat

Here are some additional ways in you can keep using bang chat throughout your project development cycle. Be creative on how you engage the tool to guide your development or unblock you if you get stuck.

#### Example: Ask help on how to build specific components and on libraries to use

Note: Explore asking Bing chat for some code samples too

#### Sample Prompt on different components/libraries

```
Can you guide me on how to create the calendar of emotions on react native?
```

#### Sample Response on different components/libraries

![Resources for calendar of emotions](./media/emotional-calendar.png)

As a student you have free access to [GitHub Copilot](https://education.github.com/pack?WT.mc_id=academic-114050-bethanycheum), that will be your coding buddy as you bring your MVP to life. You can use GitHub Copilot on various IDEs including Visual Studio, JetBrains, Neovim and Visual Studio Code.

But before you leave to create your awesome project, finish this module to identify more opportunities for you to share your project globally in a global student competition and access founders' programs for additional support to launch your very own startup.

## Step 5: Free deployment services to share your project with others

The purpose of building an MVP is to ensure that you can be able to test and validate your ideas. In addition, it gives you an opportunity to finally put your product to potential customers. We can ask Bing to give us ideas of how we can deploy our product, for example:

### Sample Prompt on deployment

```
Part of my solution is a website, and I am also thinking of building my company website. As a student, how can I deploy websites using Microsoft services or free tools to avail this to my users?
```

This should give you ideas on different tools and services you can use to deploy your project.

## Next Steps

Whether you are building a website, an application or an API there are various tools you can utilize to deploy your solution, be sure to modify the prompt to match your needs. Some additional resources you can use to deploy your solution are:

- [Deploy your company website on Azure using Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/azure-static-web-apps/?WT.mc_id=academic-114050-bethanycheum)
- [Deploy your web application with Azure using Azure Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/deploy-a-website-with-azure-app-service/?WT.mc_id=academic-114050-bethanycheum)
- [Publish your API on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/import-and-publish?WT.mc_id=academic-114050-bethanycheum)
