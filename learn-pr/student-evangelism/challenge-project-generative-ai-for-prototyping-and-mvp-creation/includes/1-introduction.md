Imagine if you could use artificial intelligence to generate prototypes for your ideas. What if you could simply describe your idea in natural language, and let AI do the rest? That is the goal of this module, that is designed to help you create your own prototype with the help of Generative AI.

Whether you want to build a mobile app, a website, a game, or a physical device, today, you can use AI to help you generate a prototype that matches your description from natural language. Our goal is to enable creators to explore their ideas without being limited by their technical skills or resources, and to foster a culture of innovation and creativity.

By the end of this module, you will learn how to use Bing Chat to guide you on how to create prototypes/ mock-ups of your solution and on implementing the project.

## Alternative Tools

You need Bing Chat to do this exercise. It involves text and image generation. If you don't have Bing Chat, you can use other tools, but you may need to change some steps. Here are some places where you can find these tools:

- Bing Image Creator at [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create?WT.mc_id=academic-114050-bethanycheum)
- ChatGPT at [OpenAI](http://openai.com/)
- Dalle-2 at OpenAI - [OpenAI](http://openai.com/)

You can use other platforms if you would like, just note that the directions are intended for Bing Chat so you might have to adapt a few things specifically when it comes to image creation.
