In this module, you learned what APIs are and how to build your own API and retrieve data from it. You also learned how to discover museum collections via museum APIs. You learned about APIs that are completely open and APIs that require access tokens. Finally, you learned about various libraries that help you access and work with APIs.

A great next step would be to discover the many APIs available to you. You could start with this [list of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?azure-portal=true).
