In this module, you learned what APIs are and how to build your own API and retrieve data from it. You also learned how to discover museum collections via their own APIs, whether they be completely open or require access tokens. Finally, you learned about various libraries that help in accessing and working with APIs.

A great next step would be to discover the many APIs available to the developer. One such list is this [list of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?azure-portal=true).
