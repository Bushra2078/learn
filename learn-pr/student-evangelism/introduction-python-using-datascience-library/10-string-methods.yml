  title: Check your Knowledge
  questions:
    - content: 'What will x + y evaluate to?'
      choices:
        - content: 'error'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Python will recognize x and y as numbers and the command will execute without errors.
        - content: '10'
          explanation: Correct.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: '"xy"'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. x and y is not regognized as strings in python without quotation marks, so string concatenation rules doesn't apply here.
    - content: what will y + z evaluate to?
      choices:
        - content: '6'
          explanation: Correct. z is assigned to 8/2 = 4 at the end, so y+z will evaluate to 2+4 = 6.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: error
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. x, y, z all evaluates to integers, so the command will execute without errors.
        - content: '4'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect.'

    - content: 'assume that all years have exactly 365 days (no leap years), and the following 4 lines are executed
"seconds_per_minute = 60
minutes_per_hour = 60
seconds_per_hour = 3600
hours_per_day = 24"
Which evaluates to the number of hours in a day?'
      choices:
        - content: seconds_per_minute
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The variable name is reflective of what it evaluates to
        - content: 'hour_per_day'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. There is no variable named "hour_per_day"'
        - content: 'hours_per_day'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.
    - content: Suppose you wanted to calculate the number of seconds in a day. Which of the following options correctly calculates the number of seconds in a day?
      choices:
        - content: seconds_per_minute * seconds_per_hour
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. seconds_per_minute * seconds_per_hour will return the number of seconds in 60 hours.
        - content: hours_per_day * seconds_per_hour
          explanation: Correct.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: seconds_per_minute * seconds_per_minute * 60
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. This also evaluates to the number of seconds in 60 hours
