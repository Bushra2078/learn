  questions:
    - content: 'The expression top_50_songs.where("num_plays", are.greater_than(1000000)) returns a table of all songs played more than 1,000,000 times. Which of the following expressions returns the same result?'
      choices:
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where(num_plays > 1000000)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.The column name should be in quotes and tbl.where should be used with an are. function or an array of True anf Falses"
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where("num_plays" > 1000000)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. tbl.where should be used with an are. function or an array of True anf Falses"
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where(top_50_songs.column("num_plays") > 1000000)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct."
        - content: 'top_50_songs.column("num_plays") > 1000000'

          isCorrect: false
    - content: 'Which of the following code will return a table containing the 100 highest ranked songs?(including the song ranked at 100)'
      choices:
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where("rank" > 100)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect'
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where("rank", are.above(100))'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect.'
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where("rank" < 100)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where("rank", are.above_or_equal_to(100))'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.
    - content: 'Which of the following code will fail to return a table containing just the songs by "Taylor Swift"'
      choices:
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where("artist_name" == "Taylor Swift")'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct. tbl.where needed two arguments or an array only tontaining True and Falses. This syntax is neither, so it will result in an error.'
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where("artist_name", "Taylor Swift")'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. are.equal_to() is used by default by tbl.where when there is a second argument, so this syntax will return the correct table as well.'
        - content: 'top_50_songs.where("artist_name", are.equal_to("Taylor Swift"))'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
