  content: 'The following commands are executed in order, what would python display? We first run six = "6"'
  title: Check your Knowledge
  questions:
    - content: 'str(six)'
      choices:
        - content: '"six"'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Python evaluates the arguments to the function first, sees that six is internally memorized as '6', then evaluates str('6').
        - content: '"6"'
          explanation: Correct
          isCorrect: true
        - content: error
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect, Python can convert string to string.
    - content: 'float(six)'
      choices:
        - content: '6.0'
          explanation: Correct. Python evaluates the arguments to the function first, sees that six is internally memorized as '6', then evaluates float('6'), which evaluates to 6.0.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: '6'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. 6 is an int, not a float, python usually displays floats with a decimal point.
        - content: error
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. the string "6" can be converted to a float.'

    - content: '"5"+"5"'
      choices:
        - content: '10'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. The "5" is a string, and string addition cannot output an integer.'
        - content: '"10"'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. The "5" is a string, and string addition does not follow the rules of normal arithmetic.'
        - content: '"55"'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. String addition(concatenation) just puts the two strings together.
