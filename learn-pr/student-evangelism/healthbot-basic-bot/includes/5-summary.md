This module introduces the user to the Healthcare Bot Platform and also helps them to create their first scenario. The user can now effectively create a basic scenario. The canvas is a place to drag and drop blocks. We simply connect them to decide the flow of the bot. The "Code" option lets the user go through a Json format of the graphical steps. This was a basic informative bot without any interrupting or breaking scenario involved. The upcoming module will show the user to enhance the bot with much more advanced Functionalities!
