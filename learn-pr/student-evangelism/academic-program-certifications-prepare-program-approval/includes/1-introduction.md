This module broadly explores the program approval process for new degree programs that implement Microsoft Certifications. 

The University of Lincoln in the UK recently designed a new degree program with certification that they've implemented for computer science courses. Throughout this module, some of the general approaches adopted by that university for implementing Microsoft Certification will be used as a  case study. Referencing their approach will support contextualizing the academic processes at other higher education institutions. 

In this module, you'll learn about the general program approval process at higher education institutions, with a focus on programs that implement Microsoft Certification. We'll identify and describe the key stakeholders involved in the program approval process. These individuals serve on panels that review the proposed program in detail. Faculty roles that are part of the program approval process vary across institutions and regions. 

For examples of the terminology and roles that are part of the US program approval process, see [The Curriculum Approval Process: A Resource Guide for Trustees and Administrators](https://ccleague.org/sites/default/files/trustees-resources/curriculum_approval_process_publication.pdf?azure-portal=true). 

For examples at a university in the UK, see [Principles for Approval of
Northumbria Awards](https://northumbria-cdn.azureedge.net/-/media/corporate-website/new-sitecore-gallery/services/academic-registry/documents/qte/programme-design-and-approval/principles-for-approval-of-northumbria-awards-edited.pdf?modified=20180530103151&azure-portal=true).

This module includes how to prepare for a program approval meeting. During the meeting, the panel reviews the program rationale and curriculum, and its members direct questions to the program leader and key members of the teaching team. The meeting involves a rigorous review of the program learning outcomes, curriculum, and student outcomes. 

When you've completed this module, you'll understand the program approval process generally and be able to identify the key stakeholders involved in program approval.
