The program approval process is the culmination of the program development process. This takes the form of an institution-hosted approval meeting and is a common approach in higher education.

The approval panel includes the stakeholders that we identified earlier in this module. Specifically, the panel likely has a chairperson who manages the agenda, a quality process officer who ensures that standards are met, student representation, and external academic and industry examiners.

The value of including an industry advisor is significant, because it helps ensure that industry requirements inform program design. The program leader might be asked to recruit suitable external academic and industry examiners for the panel.

In the context of implementing a Microsoft Certification in a program, the approval panel directs relevant questions to the program leader. 

A key member of the panel will be a faculty administrator with knowledge on academic program standards. For example, the administrator can provide guidance on the quantity of academic credits for implementing certifications at the course and program level. Because this isn't a common approach in higher education, it's worthwhile for the program leader to explore whether there are any institutional strategies or guidance documents that support it.

The  primary rationale for implementing certifications is to emphasize transferable industry skills and enhance graduate employability. 

Additionally, the course learning outcomes should be broadly mapped to the appropriate certification outcomes. Some higher education institutions offer a relatively new type of short course in the Micro-credential category. Such short courses can be used for certification and embedded in larger academic courses for optional academic credit or run as standalone courses.

For a Masters program, a program approval event often takes several hours. It might even last a full day for a bachelorâ€™s program, because of the number of courses and outcomes to evaluate. 

The structure of a program approval event broadly aligns with the following format:

1. Meeting of an approval panel to identify areas for discussion
1. Introduction and context setting by the program team
1. General discussion between panel and program team
1. Feedback to program team from panel

The approval panel pays particular attention to curriculum design and program learning outcomes. This is to ensure that courses meet program outcomes and learning outcomes. The program leader should ensure that courses meet these outcomes prior to the program approval event.
