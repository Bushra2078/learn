The program approval event is an intensive process. Two key factors in achieving program approval success are robust preparation and understanding quality assurance processes early in the program development stage, particularly their effect on implementing certifications for program graduates.  

The program team must prepare extensively for the event to ensure that they can respond appropriately to panel queries, which might range from applicant recruitment and inclusivity to technical content and the employability of graduates. 

The impact of a positive approval event is that the new program can be launched on time, and students will have access to the new opportunities the program affords them. 

From an institutional perspective, the impact of implementing certifications is that it will positively influence graduates' employability outcomes.
