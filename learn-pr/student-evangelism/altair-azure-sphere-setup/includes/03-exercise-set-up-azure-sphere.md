```

### Install PowerShell

Install the latest version of PowerShell on your computer.

- [PowerShell on Linux](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux)

### Install the real-time core GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for Linux

Install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for Linux

1. Download the latest [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads?azure-portal=true).
2. Install the downloaded package. The following installs the toolchain in the /opt folder.

    ```bash
    sudo tar -xjvf gcc-arm-none-eabi-<version-number>-major-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2 -C /opt
    ```

3. Update your path. Open ~/.bashrc and add to the end.

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-<version-number>-major/bin
    ```

4. Optional: The real-time core debugger relies on the *libncurses.so.5* library. Depending on your system setup, this library may already be install, if not, then run the following commands.

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    sudo apt-get install libncurses5
    ```

## Recommended Visual Studio Code Extension

The Peacock extension allows you to change the color of your Visual Studio Code workspace. The Peacock extension is useful when you have multiple instances of Visual Studio Code open.

   1. Open Extensions sideBar panel in Visual Studio Code, or from the menu, select View â†’ Extensions.
   1. Search for Peacock.
   1. Select Install.
   1. Select Reload, if necessary.

## Delete existing applications on Azure Sphere

   azsphere device enable-development
   ```

## Enable real-time core development

### Windows 10 users

1. Open the Windows **PowerShell command line** as **Administrator**, and run the following command to enable real-time core development on the device.

   ```azsphere
   azsphere device enable-development -r
   ```

### Linux users

1. Open the Linux **Terminal** and run the following command to enable real-time core development on the device.

   ```bash
   azsphere device enable-development -r
   ```

## Clone the AzureSphereAltair8800 GitHub repository

> [!NOTE]
> Clone the *Altair project* to a folder close to the root folder on your computer. For example, **c:\lab**, or **~/**. The reason is that the Azure Sphere build process uses CMake which can struggle with long path and folder names.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AzureSphereCloudEnabledAltair8800/AzureSphereAltair8800.git
```

## Update and test your Azure Sphere installation

When the Altair emulator project was released, it targeted version 10 of the Azure Sphere APIs and version 21.07 of the Azure Sphere SDK. It is likely you installed a more recent version of the Azure Sphere SDK.

Follow these steps to update the configuration files for all high-level Azure Sphere projects in the **Altair8800Emulator** folder.

The **Update_config**

1. Open a **Command prompt**.
1. Navigate to the **Altair8800Emulator** folder you cloned to your computer.
1. Run the **update_Config** PowerShell script.

    ```pwsh
    pwsh ./tools/build-tools/update_config.ps1

    ```

> For your information. The **update_config** updates the **cmake/azsphere_config.cmake** file for each high-level Azure Sphere project in the **Altair8800Emulator** folder you cloned.

Test you can build the Altair 8800 projects.

1. From the **command prompt**
1. Ensure you are still in the **Altair8800Emulator** folder you cloned to your computer.
1. Run the **Build_all** PowerShell script.

    ```pwsh
    pwsh ./tools/build-tools/build_all.ps1

    ```

1. Check the build completion message to confirm a successful build. The build completion message will be similar to `Build All completed successfully. Elapsed time: 00:00:17`. If the build process fails, check that you installed all the required components. On Windows, check you added Ninja and Cmake to the Path.

1. Exit the command prompt.
