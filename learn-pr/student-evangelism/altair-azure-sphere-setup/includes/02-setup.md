In this unit, you'll learn how to:

1. Install the Azure Sphere SDK on your Windows 10 or Linux computer.
1. Claim your Azure Sphere device.
1. Set up Azure Sphere for application deployments.

## Steps to install

The steps you'll need to take are:

- **Install Azure Sphere SDK**: so that you work with the **azsphere** command-line utility.
- **Claim your device**: by using an Azure Sphere tenant. Each device is claimed once, and after you claim your device, you can't move it to a different tenant. Claiming the device associates its unique, immutable device ID with your Azure Sphere tenant. The Azure Sphere Security Service uses the device ID to identify and authenticate the device.
- **Configure Azure Sphere for network connection and update the device OS**: The Azure Sphere device checks and receives OS updates and application updates from the Azure Sphere Security Service each time it boots. Azure Sphere can also communicate with services such as Azure IoT Hub.

## Configuration steps

The steps you follow are:

1. Install Visual Studio Code
1. Install the Azure Sphere SDK.
1. Claim your Azure Sphere device.
   1. Sign in to Azure Sphere.
   1. Create a new tenant.
   1. Set the default Azure Sphere tenant.
   1. Claim your Azure Sphere device.
1. Configure the Azure Sphere Wi-Fi network.
1. Update the Azure Sphere OS.
1. Enable app development on the device.

After you complete this unit, the components you need will be installed and your development environment will be set up to develop Azure Sphere applications.
