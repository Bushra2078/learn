### Visualization

Tables are a powerful way of organizing and visualizing data. However,
large tables of numbers can be difficult to interpret, no matter how
organized they are. Sometimes it is much easier to interpret graphs than
numbers.

In this chapter, we will develop some of the fundamental graphical
methods of data analysis. Our source of data is the [Internet Movie
Database](http://www.imdb.com), an online database that contains
information about movies, television shows, video games, and so on. The
site [Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com) provides many
summaries of IMDB data, some of which we have adapted. We have also used
data summaries from [The Numbers](http://www.the-numbers.com), a site
with a tagline that says it is "where data and the movie business meet."

### Scatter plots and line graphs

The table `actors` contains data on Hollywood actors, both male and
female. The columns are:

|  |  |
|--|--|
|**Actor**|Name of actor|
|**Total Gross**|Total gross domestic box office receipt, in millions of dollars, of all of the actor's movies|
|**Number of Movies**|The number of movies the actor has been in|
|**Average per Movie**|Total gross divided by number of movies|
|**#1 movie**|The highest grossing movie the actor has been in|
|**Gross**| Gross domestic box office receipt, in millions of dollars, of the actor's #1 Movie|

In the calculation of the gross receipt, the data tabulators did not
include movies where an actor had a cameo role or a speaking role that
did not involve much screen time.

The table has 50 rows, corresponding to the 50 top grossing actors. The
table is already sorted by `Total Gross`, so it is easy to see that
Harrison Ford is the highest grossing actor. In total, his movies have
brought in more money at domestic box office than the movies of any
other actor.

``` python
actors = Table.read_table(path_data + 'actors.csv')
actors
```

``` output
| Actor              | Total Gross | Number of Movies | Average per Movie | #1 Movie                     | Gross |
|--------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Harrison Ford      | 4871.7      | 41               | 118.8             | Star Wars: The Force Awakens | 936.7 |
| Samuel L. Jackson  | 4772.8      | 69               | 69.2              | The Avengers                 | 623.4 |
| Morgan Freeman     | 4468.3      | 61               | 73.3              | The Dark Knight              | 534.9 |
| Tom Hanks          | 4340.8      | 44               | 98.7              | Toy Story 3                  | 415   |
| Robert Downey, Jr. | 3947.3      | 53               | 74.5              | The Avengers                 | 623.4 |
| Eddie Murphy       | 3810.4      | 38               | 100.3             | Shrek 2                      | 441.2 |
| Tom Cruise         | 3587.2      | 36               | 99.6              | War of the Worlds            | 234.3 |
| Johnny Depp        | 3368.6      | 45               | 74.9              | Dead Man's Chest             | 423.3 |
| Michael Caine      | 3351.5      | 58               | 57.8              | The Dark Knight              | 534.9 |
| Scarlett Johansson | 3341.2      | 37               | 90.3              | The Avengers                 | 623.4 |

**Terminology.** A *variable* is a formal name for what we have been
calling a "feature", such as 'number of movies.' The term *variable*
emphasizes that the feature can have different values for different
individuals--the number of movies that actors have been in varies
across all the actors.

Variables that have numerical values, such as 'number of movies' or
'average gross receipts per movie' are called *quantitative* or
*numerical* variables.

### Scatter plots

A *scatter plot* displays the relation between two numerical variables.
You saw an example of a scatter plot in an early section where we looked
at the number of periods and number of characters in two classic novels.

The Table method `scatter` draws a scatter plot consisting of one point
for each row of the table. Its first argument is the label of the column
to be plotted on the horizontal axis, and its second argument is the
label of the column on the vertical.

``` python
actors.scatter('Number of Movies', 'Total Gross')
```

![Scatter plot of number of movies and total gross.](../media/40-visualization-8-0.png)

The plot contains 50 points, one point for each actor in the table. You
can see that it slopes upwards, in general. The more movies an actor has
been in, the more the total gross of all of those movies--in general.

Formally, we say that the plot shows an *association* between the
variables, and that the association is *positive*: high values of one
variable tend to be associated with high values of the other, and low
values of one with low values of the other, in general.

There is some variability. Some actors have high numbers of
movies but middling total gross receipts. Others have middling numbers
of movies but high receipts. That the association is positive is simply
a statement about the broad general trend.

Later in the course we will study how to quantify association. For the
moment, we will just think about it qualitatively.

Now that we have explored how the number of movies is related to the
*total* gross receipt, let's turn our attention to how it is related to
the *average* gross receipt per movie.

``` python
actors.scatter('Number of Movies', 'Average per Movie')
```

![Scatter plot of number of movies against the average gross receipt per movie.](../media/40-visualization-11-0.png)

This is a markedly different picture and shows a *negative* association.
In general, the more movies an actor has been in, the *less* the average
receipt per movie.

Also, one of the points is high and off to the left of the plot.
It corresponds to one actor who has a low number of movies and high
average per movie. This point is an *outlier*. It lies outside the
general range of the data. Indeed, it is far from all the other
points in the plot.

We will examine the negative association further by looking at points at
the right and left ends of the plot.

For the right end, let's zoom in on the main body of the plot by just
looking at the portion that doesn't have the outlier.

``` python
no_outlier = actors.where('Number of Movies', are.above(10))
no_outlier.scatter('Number of Movies', 'Average per Movie')
```

![Average gross per movie for actors that have appeared in more than 10 movies.](../media/40-visualization-14-0.png)

The negative association is still clearly visible. Let's identify the
actors corresponding to the points that lie on the right-hand side of
the plot where the number of movies is large:

``` python
actors.where('Number of Movies', are.above(60))
```

``` output
| Actor             | Total Gross | Number of Movies | Average per Movie | #1 Movie           | Gross |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Samuel L. Jackson | 4772.8      | 69               | 69.2              | The Avengers       | 623.4 |
| Morgan Freeman    | 4468.3      | 61               | 73.3              | The Dark Knight    | 534.9 |
| Robert DeNiro     | 3081.3      | 79               | 39                | Meet the Fockers   | 279.3 |
| Liam Neeson       | 2942.7      | 63               | 46.7              | The Phantom Menace | 474.5 |
```

The great actor Robert DeNiro has the highest number of movies and the
lowest average receipt per movie. Other fine actors are at points that
are not far away, but DeNiro's is at the extreme end.

To understand the negative association, note that the more movies an
actor is in, the more variable those movies might be, in terms of style,
genre, and box office draw. For example, an actor might be in some
high-grossing action movies or comedies (such as Meet the Fockers), and
also in a large number of smaller films that may be excellent but don't
draw large crowds. Thus the actor's value of average receipts per movie
might be relatively low.

To approach this argument from a different direction, let us now take a
look at the outlier.

``` python
actors.where('Number of Movies', are.below(10))
```

``` output
| Actor           | Total Gross | Number of Movies | Average per Movie | #1 Movie                     | Gross |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Anthony Daniels | 3162.9      | 7                | 451.8             | Star Wars: The Force Awakens | 936.7 |
```

As an actor, Anthony Daniels might not have the stature of Robert
DeNiro. But his seven movies had an astonishingly high average receipt of
nearly $452 million dollars per movie.

What were these movies? You might know about the droid C-3PO in Star
Wars:

![C-3PO](../media/c-3po-droid.png)

That's [Anthony
Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Daniels) inside the
metallic suit. He plays C-3PO.

Mr.Â Daniels' entire filmography (apart from cameos) consists of movies
in the high-grossing Star Wars franchise. That explains both his high
average receipt and his low number of movies.

Variables such as genre and production budget have an effect on the
association between the number of movies and the average receipt per
movie. This example is a reminder that studying the association between
two variables often involves understanding other related variables as
well.

### Line graphs

Line graphs are among the most common visualizations and are often used
to study chronological trends and patterns.

The table `movies_by_year` contains data on movies produced by U.S.
studios in each of the years 1980 through 2015. The columns report this data for each year:

- Total domestic box office gross, in millions of dollars, of all movies released
- Number of movies released
- Highest grossing movie

``` python
movies_by_year = Table.read_table(path_data + 'movies_by_year.csv')
movies_by_year
```

``` output
| Year | Total Gross | Number of Movies | #1 Movie                            |   |   |
|------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|---|---|
| 2015 | 11128.5     | 702              | Star Wars: The Force Awakens        |   |   |
| 2014 | 10360.8     | 702              | American Sniper                     |   |   |
| 2013 | 10923.6     | 688              | Catching Fire                       |   |   |
| 2012 | 10837.4     | 667              | The Avengers                        |   |   |
| 2011 | 10174.3     | 602              | Harry Potter / Deathly Hallows (P2) |   |   |
| 2010 | 10565.6     | 536              | Toy Story 3                         |   |   |
| 2009 | 10595.5     | 521              | Avatar                              |   |   |
| 2008 | 9630.7      | 608              | The Dark Knight                     |   |   |
| 2007 | 9663.8      | 631              | Spider-Man 3                        |   |   |
| 2006 | 9209.5      | 608              | Dead Man's Chest                    |   |   |

... (26 rows omitted)
```

The Table method `plot` produces a line graph. Its two arguments are the
same as those for `scatter`: first the column on the horizontal axis,
then the column on the vertical. Here is a line graph of the number of
movies released each year over the years 1980 through 2015.

``` python
movies_by_year.plot('Year', 'Number of Movies')
```

![Number of movies released per year from 1980 to 2015.](../media/40-visualization-23-0.png)

The graph rises sharply and then has a gentle upwards trend though the
numbers vary noticeably from year to year. The sharp rise in the early
1980s is due in part to studios returning to the forefront of movie
production after some years of filmmaker driven movies in the 1970s.

Our focus will be on more recent years. In keeping with the theme of
movies, the table of rows corresponding to the years 2000 through 2015
have been assigned to the name `century_21`.

``` python
century_21 = movies_by_year.where('Year', are.above(1999))
```

``` python
century_21.plot('Year', 'Number of Movies')
```

![Number of movies released per year from 2000 to 2015.](../media/40-visualization-26-0.png)

The global financial crisis of 2008 has a visible effect--in 2009
there is a sharp drop in the number of movies released.

The dollar figures, however, didn't suffer much.

``` python
century_21.plot('Year', 'Total Gross')
```

![Total movie gross per year from 2000 to 2015.](../media/40-visualization-28-0.png)

The total domestic gross receipt was higher in 2009 than in 2008, even
though there was a financial crisis and a much smaller number of movies
were released.

One reason for this apparent contradiction is that people tend to go to
the movies when there is a recession. ["In Downturn, Americans Flock to
the
Movies,"](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/movies/01films.html?_r=0)
said the New York Times in February 2009. The article quotes Martin
Kaplan of the University of Southern California saying, "People want to
forget their troubles, and they want to be with other people." When
holidays and expensive treats are unaffordable, movies provide welcome
entertainment and relief.

In 2009, another reason for high box office receipts was the movie
Avatar and its 3D release. Not only was Avatar the \#1 movie of 2009, it
is also by some calculations the second highest grossing movie of all
time, as we will see later.

``` python
century_21.where('Year', are.equal_to(2009))
```

``` output
| Year | Total Gross | Number of Movies | #1 Movie |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| 2009 | 10595.5     | 521              | Avatar   |
```
