Before you start the module, you need to set up your virtual environmentâ€”some of the units and assignments can be viewed interactively through Jupyter notebooks.

If you are not interested in viewing the content interactively, feel free to skip the steps below.

## You will need:

A Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at https://azure.microsoft.com.

A Microsoft Azure Student subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for an Azure for Student Subscription at https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students.

A Visual Studio Codespaces environment based on the MicrosoftDocs/inferentialthinking code repository. This environment provides a hosted instance of Visual Studio Codespaces, in which you'll be able to run the interactive notebooks.

## To set up a Visual Studio Codespaces environment:

1. Open [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://online.visualstudio.com/environments/new?azure-portal=true&name=MicrosoftDocs&repo=MicrosoftDocs/inferentialthinking) in a new browser tab; and if prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

1. If you don't already have a Visual Studio Codespaces billing plan, create one. Then create an environment with the following settings:

- Environment Name: A name for your environment - for example, inferential thinking.

- Git Repository: MicrosoftDocs/inferentialthinking

- Instance Type: Standard (Linux) 4 cores, 8GB RAM

- Suspend idle environment after: 30 minutes

1. Wait for the environment to be created. This will take around a minute.

1. Wait for another minute or so while the environment is set up for you. It might look like nothing is happening, but in the background we're installing some components you'll need for the exercise. You'll see the following things happen:

1. A list of notebook (.ipynb) files will appear in the pane on the left.
