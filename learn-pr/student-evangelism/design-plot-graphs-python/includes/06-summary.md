You have explored one of the most powerful tools in any Data Scientists belt: visualization. In today's world, data is plentiful as it is generated every second and is present everywhere, giving rise to popular terms like "Big Data". While Tables are great, they're often not the most intuitive and can get hard to interpret especially as they increase in size. To make the tables easier to interpret, we need alternate methods to visualize data as studied in the module.

Here are some of the learning objectives achieved in this module.

- Learned different fundamental graphical methods of data analysis: Scatter Plots, Line Graphs, Bar Charts, and Histograms.
- Studied categorical and numerical distributions and the difference between them.
- Compared two different datasets through Overlaid Graphs in the datascience Library.
