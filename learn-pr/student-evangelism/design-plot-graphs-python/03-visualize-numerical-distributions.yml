quiz:
  questions:
    - content: 'Which bin contains the most number of players?'
      choices:
        - content: 'bin [0, 2)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. We look for the bar with the largest area, since the area of a bar is equal to the percent of data values that are in the corresponding bin. The areas of the bins are (2 - 0) * 17.64 = 35.28, (4 - 2) * 11.39 = 22.78, (12 - 4) * 3.60 = 28.8, (18 - 12) * 1.60 = 9.6, and (26 - 18) * 0.45 = 3.6. The first bin [0, 2) has the greatest area with 35.28.
        - content: 'bin [2, 4)'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'bin [4, 12)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'bin [12, 18)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'bin [18, 26)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: 'Which bin contains the least number of players?'
      choices:
        - content: 'bin [0, 2)'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'bin [2, 4)'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'bin [4, 12)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'bin [12, 18)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'bin [18, 26)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.We look for the bar with the largest area, since area of a bar is equal to the percent of data values that are in the corresponding bin. The areas for each bin is calculated using area of bar = width of bar * height of bar. Therefore the areas of the bins are (2 - 0) * 17.64 = 35.28, (4 - 2) * 11.39 = 22.78, (12 - 4) * 3.60 = 28.8, (18 - 12) * 1.60 = 9.6, and (26 - 18) * 0.45 = 3.6. The last bin [18, 26) has the least area with 3.6.
    - content: 'What proportion of players have a salary between 4 and 12 million dollars?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Somewhere between 3% and 4%'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect.'
        - content: 'Somewhere between 10% and 12%'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'Somewhere between 28% and 30%'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The proportion of players with a salary in this range is the area of the third bar from the left. (12 - 4) * 3.60 = 28.8%, which is between 28% and 30%.
