title: Design and plot graphs in Python
summary: Learn about plots and graphs in Python
abstract: |
  The UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational 
  thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that 
  data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming 
  and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, 
  document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data 
  analysis such as privacy and design.
  
  ***Produced in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley - Ani Adhikari and John Denero with Contributions from David Wagner [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html).*** 

  In this module, you will:
  - Learn different fundamental graphical methods of data analysis: Scatter Plots, Line Graphs, Bar Charts, and Histograms.
  - Study categorical and numerical distributions and the difference between them.
  - Compare two different datasets through Overlaid Graphs in the datascience Library.
