Letâ€™s consider the scenario of the logistics company for transporting fruit and other perishables. The multiple stakeholders involved (growers, retailers, transport operators and customers) all want to ensure the quality of the produce in real-time.

In this scenario, Azure IoT can help in building a secure solution on behalf of all the stakeholders. The solution provisions, connects, monitors and controls all your IoT assets end-to-end through the cloud. Without the Azure IoT solution provisioned through the cloud, the stakeholders would not be able to ensure the quality of the produce in real-time. 

The Azure IoT solution provides business value by keeping track of temperature, humidity etc. during the transportation process. The solution extends beyond telemetry by providing analytics and edge solutions to provide real-time status for the stakeholders.
