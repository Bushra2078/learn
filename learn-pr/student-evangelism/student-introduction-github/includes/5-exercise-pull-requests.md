Now that you have set up your GitHub account, created a repository, and cloned it to your local machine, let's learn how to create issues and raise a pull request (PR) in a collaborative project. 

## Create issues

1. Open your GitHub repository in your web browser.
1. Select the **Issues** tab at the top of the repository.
1. Select the green **New Issue** button.
1. Provide a descriptive title for the issue.
1. Add a detailed description, including the problem you're addressing or the feature you're suggesting. You can use labels to categorize issues (for example: bug, enhancement, feature).
1. Assign the issue to yourself or a team member, if needed.
1. Select **Submit new issue** to create the issue.

## Raise a pull request (PR)

1. After you've made changes to your local repository, commit and push those changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

1. On the GitHub page of your forked repository, a banner will suggest that you compare changes in the branch. Select the **Compare & pull request** button.

1. Give your pull request a descriptive title and provide additional context in the comment box.

1. Review the changes you've made and ensure they're accurate.

1. If your changes relate to an existing issue, you can reference the issue by adding a comment and mentioning the issue by using the pound sign ("#") symbol followed by the issue number.

1. If everything looks good, select the **Create pull request** button. Your pull request is now open for review and discussion by your team members.

If changes or improvements are requested during the review, make the necessary adjustments in your local repository and push the changes. The pull request will be updated automatically.

By following these steps, you can actively contribute to the collaborative project by creating and addressing issues, as well as raising pull requests to propose changes. This iterative process promotes teamwork, communication, and the improvement of your shared project on GitHub.
