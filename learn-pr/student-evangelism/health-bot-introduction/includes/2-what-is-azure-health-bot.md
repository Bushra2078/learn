The Azure Health Bot service is a cloud platform that empowers developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy compliant virtual health assistants and health bots. These tools take advantage of AI and help healthcare organizations to improve processes and reduce costs.

The service combines built-in medical intelligence with natural language capabilities and more. It allows healthcare organizations to give people access to trusted and relevant healthcare services and information. 

Healthcare organizations often have a wide range of users. To meet the diverse expectations of those users, the Health Bot service simplifies the process of creating a health bot. The service also simplifies the integration of the bot with existing systems in the organization that patients, nurses, doctors, and other representatives access.

To enhance the usability of the health bot, organizations can give it a personal touch by:

- Introducing custom scenarios into it.
- Integrating it with other IT systems and data sources. 

These capabilities give users a customized experience each time they interact with the health bot.

Customers such as American Nurses Foundation and Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) have been using the Azure Health Bot service to drive patient engagement in various use cases.

Kate Judge, Executive Director of American Nurses Foundation, shares with us:

> "As part of our Well-Being Initiative, we created the Stress Self-Assessment tool using the Azure Health Bot. This tool offers an anonymous way for nurses to check on themselves and receive guidance to safeguard their well-being. The bot helps nurses discover and make use of a variety of evidence-based ways to build strength and maintain health, like peer support, guided relaxation, apps with well-being tools, and webinars."  

Let's learn more about the features that make the Azure Health Bot accommodating and adaptable for its users.

### Out-of-the-box AI and world knowledge capabilities

A built-in, interactive symptom checker and medical database enables patients to have meaningful conversations with the health bot. Health Bot instances handle interruptions, topic changes, human error, and complex medical questions.  

### Configurability and extensibility

Healthcare organizations can flexibly extend a Health Bot instance to their own scenarios. The behavior of the Health Bot instance can be configured to match the organization's use cases, processes, and scenarios. The Health Bot instance can be connected to information systems like those that manage electronic medical records (EMRs), health information, and customer information.  

### Security and privacy

The Azure architecture provides the Health Bot service's ability to scale with resilience, while maintaining high standards of [privacy and security](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/complianceofferings?product=Azure). The Azure architecture helps ensure that each Health Bot instance handles privacy-protected and secure information.

### Ease of management

The management portal for the Azure Health Bot service is used to easily configure and manage the scenarios and configurations. The Health Bot service also provides an API to enable programmatic management actions; for example, programmatic import and export of scenarios from the Scenario Editor.
