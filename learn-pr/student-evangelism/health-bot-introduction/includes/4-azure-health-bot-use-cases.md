To determine if Health Bot is for you, let's see some scenarios that you can use. 

Health Bot contains built-in scenarios like the following:

- **Triage/symptom checker, based on built-in medical protocols**: The user describes a symptom to the Health Bot instance. The bot helps the user to understand the symptom and suggests how to react. For example: "I have a headache."

- **General information about conditions, symptoms, causes, and complications**: Loaded with medical content, the Health Bot instance can provide information about medical conditions, symptoms, causes, and complications. For example: "information about diabetes," "what are the causes of malaria," or "tell me about the complications of arthritis."

- **Find doctor type**: The Health Bot instance can recommend the appropriate type of doctor to treat an illness. For example: "what type of doctor treats diabetes?"

If you want to build something more detailed, here are examples of scenarios that our customers typically build as extensions by using the scenario-authoring elements:

- **Health plan inquiries**: You can customize your Health Bot instance to access health plan details, such as pricing and benefits.

- **Finding providers**: Your Health Bot instance can allow customers to search for doctors by specialty, in-network status, and other specifications.

- **Scheduling appointments**: Your Health Bot instance can be designed to allow your customers to schedule appointments easily and securely.

Now, let's examine how two kinds of companies can use the Health Bot Service:

- Insurance companies can build Health Bot instances that give their customers an easy way to look up the status of a claim and ask questions about benefits and services. Through this interaction, customers acquire better communication with the company, and the company understands the existing needs.

- Providers can build Health Bot instances that triage patient issues with a symptom checker, help patients find appropriate care, and look up nearby doctors. In this way, patients have an integrated solution that helps them with everyday healthcare issues.

- Pharmaceutical companies can build Health Bot instances that help customers to check their eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccine. The bot can provide patients with more information about the vaccine and schedule an appointment for getting their vaccines at a desired location.
