# Exercise 1 - Integrate Azure AI Speech Service into Your Canvas App

You are almost done. The last step is to make the features fully functional and maximize their capabilities. Integrating AI into your solution is what makes this level of enhancement possible. It redefines the boundaries of what can be achieved, empowering you to accomplish much more, much faster than was feasible previously. In this case, AI-enabled language transcription takes it to the next level.

## Specification
Create a Power Apps App that meets the following basic functionalities and specifications:

- Add functionality to the Microphone feature to capture what is being said and pass this input to the AzureBatchSpeech-to-text API for translation and show the result in a Text field.

- Add fnctionality to the Audio feature to read out the translated text.


## Check your work
To validate that you have completed working on the requirement for this first exercise, test your app behavior out by following these steps:
1. Run your App, Start a new translation
2. Press the Microphone control to record a speech
3. Use drop down to select translation language
4. Press the button to trigger text-to-speech
5. Listen to the translated text.

Congratulations! Your commitment paid off. You have now built a Speech Translator Application using LowCode Solution - Power Apps and Microsoft Azure AI Service.
