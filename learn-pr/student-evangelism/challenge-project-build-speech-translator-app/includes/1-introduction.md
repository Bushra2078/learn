# Introduction
One of the best way to demonstrate your skill is by working on portfolio-worthy projects. This usually start by taking up a well documented challenge.

In this module, you will build a Canvas App and integrate Microsoft AI Services into it. This will come with a lot of learning opportunities as you will have to interact with Microsoft Azure AI services as well as integrate them into the application you are building.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **_challenge project_** module where you will complete a project end-to-end based on a specification. This module is designed to be a test of your skills: there are few guidelines and no step-by-step instructions.

## About the challenge
Communication is a vital element of our everyday life. To make life more inclusive for people, we will leverage LowCode solution Power Apps to build a Speech Translator App. 

The app will use the Speech Service API from Microsoft Azure AI Service to recognize the userâ€™s speech and convert it to text as well as translate the text to the desired language. The app can also speak out the translated text using the Speech Service API. The app can support multiple languages and dialects.

By the end of this module, you'll have built a solution that addresses communication barrier in the workplace.

**Summary:** This Challenge Project will help you demonstrate your ability to analyze and translate project requirement into a solution as well as showcase your technical skill using Power Apps and Microsoft Azure AI Services.
