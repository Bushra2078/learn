One of the best ways to demonstrate your skill is by working on portfolio-worthy projects. This usually starts by taking up a well-documented challenge.

In this learning module, you'll build a canvas app and integrate Microsoft Azure AI services into it. This project comes with numerous learning opportunities as you get to interact with Microsoft Azure AI services and integrate them into the application you're building.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **_challenge project_** module where you will complete a project end-to-end based on a specification. This module is designed to be a test of your skills - there are few guidelines and no step-by-step instructions.

## About the challenge

Communication is a vital element of our everyday life. To make life more inclusive for people, we'll use low-code solution Power Apps to build a speech translator app.

The app uses the Speech service API from Microsoft Azure AI services to recognize the user's speech, convert it to text, and translate the text to the desired language. The app can also speak out the translated text using the Speech service API. The app can support multiple languages and dialects.

By the end of this module, you'll build a solution that addresses communication barriers in the workplace.

**Summary:** This challenge project demonstrates your ability to analyze and translate project requirements into a solution as well as showcase your technical skill using Power Apps and Microsoft Azure AI services.
