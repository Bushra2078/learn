To build this solution, you'll be creating custom tables and columns in Dataverse. You'll need some services in place to get started. In this unit, we'll discuss the things you need to get started.

## Project specification

Let's talk through a more detailed project description for the use case in consideration - 'Build a speech translator app with Power Apps.'

## Fabrikam, Inc

Fabrikam, Inc., is a fictitious multinational company with several employees and offices around the world. Fabrikam host an annual employee thanksgiving event that results in a gathering of over 100,000 employees across over 70 regions for a five-day celebration.

With the diversity of the participants, there are noticeable language barriers that often affect collaboration, communication, and networking. Fabrikam is looking forward to addressing this challenge in this year's event and they need you to build the solution.

## Brief requirement

* The app is accessible to only the employees of Fabrikam.
* Users should be able to select the spoken language and translation language.
* For each conversation, the app should have control buttons to read out the translated text.
* Be creative with any extra features you think can make the app more usable and accessible to the employees of Fabrikam.
