To build the solution, you'll create custom tables and columns in Microsoft Dataverse. You'll need some services in place to get started. In this unit, we'll discuss the project specification and the tools you'll need.

## Project specification

This section describes the project and requirements for the use case to build a speech translator app by using Power Apps.

### Fabrikam, Inc.

Fabrikam, Inc., is a fictitious multinational company with several employees and offices around the world. Fabrikam hosts an annual employee thanksgiving event that brings together over 100,000 employees from more than 70 regions for a five-day celebration.

The diversity of participants means that language barriers can affect communication, networking, and collaboration. Fabrikam is looking forward to addressing this challenge at this year's event and they need you to build the solution.

### Brief requirement

* The app is accessible to employees of Fabrikam only.
* Users can select the spoken language and the translation language.
* For each conversation, users can press a control button in the app to read out the translated text.
* Be creative with any extra features you think might make the app more usable and accessible for Fabrikam's employees.
