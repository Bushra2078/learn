In the scenario we outlined above, you were tasked with identifying images with deer in the park. You want to detect the proximity of deer to people within images captured from an edge device. Using a model that can identify deer images in the Azure sphere, you can capture this data to analyse people's behavior, deer, and dogs. Image classification on Azure Sphere allowed you to analyse images in near real-time on Edge devices. Based on this data, you can formulate new guidelines to improve park safety.
