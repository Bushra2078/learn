In the scenario we outlined above, you were tasked with identifying images with deer in the park. You want to detect the proximity of deer to people within images captured from an edge device. Using a model that can identify deer images in Azure Sphere, you can capture this data to analyze the behavior of people, deer, and dogs. Image classification on Azure Sphere allowed you to analyze images in near real time on edge devices. Based on this data, you can formulate new guidelines to improve park safety.
