To create a new real-time application, you'll simply start with the [HelloWorld_RTApp_MT3620_BareMetal sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples/tree/master/Samples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld_RTApp_MT3620_BareMetal) and adjust the configuration to your project. You'll be using Visual Studio Code for this module.

You use the following components:

**Azure Sphere samples repository:** This repository contains samples for the Azure Sphere platform. 

**HelloWorld_RTApp_MT3620_BareMetal:** This sample demonstrates how to create, deploy, and run MT3620 real-time capable applications. In this unit, you'll make a copy of this project and modify it as required.

**Visual Studio Code**: is a source-code editor. You use Visual Studio Code as a development tool for the IoT device.

The steps you'll follow:

1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples).
2. Create a new project based on [HelloWorld_RTApp_MT3620_BareMetal](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples/tree/master/Samples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld_RTApp_MT3620_BareMetal).
3. Adjust configuration in your source code as required.

After completing this unit, you'll be able to create a real-time application and you'll update the source code and the configuration for your real time image classification application in the next step.
