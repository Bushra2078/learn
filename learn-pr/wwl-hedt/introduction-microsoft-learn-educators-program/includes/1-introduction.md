Our world is changing at a remarkable speed. And this speed means that it is nearly impossible to predict what skills students entering the workforce will require in the next five to ten years, let alone over the span of their careers. [The Future of Jobs - Reports - World Economic Forum (weforum.org)](https://reports.weforum.org/future-of-jobs-2016/chapter-1-the-future-of-jobs-and-skills/) reports the following job-related statistics: 

- Currently, there will be 6.2 million job openings in cloud-based technology. 

- Employers struggle to find employees with the right technical skills to meet their organizational objectives. 

- Today's students want more than a diplomaâ€”they want real-world skills that make them employable from the onset. 

- Departments and faculty want the right resources to deliver innovative technical courses to meet their students' needs. 

- Employers highly value graduates who have their degree plus an industry-recognized certification.
