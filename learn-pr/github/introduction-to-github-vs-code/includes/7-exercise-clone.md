## Clone a new repository from GitHub

1. Open a new VS Code window. From the File Explorer view, you can click on "Clone Repository". You should see an option to clone from GitHub. 
   
2. You will see a list of your repositories. You can also search for any repository on GitHub from here. Search for this *insert repository name*.
   
3. Create a new terminal and enter the command `git remote -v` to confirm that VS Code set up your remote repository correctly, so that it points to the GitHub repository that you cloned from.
   
4. Use `Ctrl + P` to navigate to this file *insert name of file* and open it up. You can expand the pane called "Timeline" and you should be able to see *X* number of commits. 
   
5. Click on the commit made by the user `burkeholland`. This will open a read-only diff view so you can see all the changes associated with the commit. 
   
6. As you browse the project and open new files, ensure that the Timeline updates with the commits for each specific file.
