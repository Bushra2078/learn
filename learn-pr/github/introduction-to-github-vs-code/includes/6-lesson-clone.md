Imagine now that you want to contribute to another project that you've come across on GitHub. You'll want to bring this remote repository down to your local computer so that you can start playing around with it. You'll also want to explore the repository and understand how it works so that you can make a meaningful contribution.

## How to clone a repository

VS Code provides a feature to search for and clone any repository you want over HTTPS. Cloning a repository from GitHub will download a local copy of an existing remote repository. Usually, when you do this via the Git CLI, you have to enter your GitHub credentials. You also have to set the local repository's remote URL, which means you provide a link to the original repository that is hosted on GitHub so that when you make changes, they are pushed to the remote server. 

VS Code will simplify the experience of cloning a repository and even set up your remote URL for you, so that you can start working faster. 

Often when you clone a repository, you'll start browsing the files to understand what's happening and the history of the project. To make this more streamlined, VS Code provides a Timeline view that shows you all previous commits to each file. This is helpful when you want to gain context of the repository, see who contributed to it, and how old or recent the changes to the project are.
