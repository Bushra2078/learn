## Publish a new repository to GitHub

1. Create a new folder called `mslearn-demo` on your local computer and open it in VS Code.

2. Create a new file called `index.html` to the folder and paste in the following code:
   
`````
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>MS Learn</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>You just published a repository!</h1>
    </body>

    </html>
`````

3. After saving the file, go to the Source Control icon in the activity bar, or toggle the view by going to View -> SCM. 
   
4. Click on "Publish Repository".
   
5. Choose if you want the repo to be a public repository or private repository. 
   
   
6. Choose the `index.html` file you previously created. This will initalize the repository and push the file you've created with the commit "first commit". *If you do not select any files in this step, it is the equivalent of creating an empty repository on GitHub. You will still have to initialize the repository after it's been created on GitHub.*
   
7. You will then see a prompt to view the created repository on GitHub.
