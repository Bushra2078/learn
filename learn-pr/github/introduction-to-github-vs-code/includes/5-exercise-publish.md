1. Create a new folder on your local computer and open it in VS Code.
2. Add a file to this folder in VS Code.
3. In the File Explorer view, click on "Publish Repository".
4. Choose if you want it to be a public repository or private repository. 
5. Choose the file you previously created. This will initalize the repo and push the files you've created with the commit "first commit". *If you do not select any files in this step, you will still have to initialize the repository after it's been created on GitHub.*
6. You will then see a prompt to view the created repository on Github.
