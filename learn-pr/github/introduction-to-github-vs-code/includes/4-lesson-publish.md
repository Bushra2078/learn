To make it easier for you to start working on a GitHub project, you can authenticate with your GitHub account inside Visual Studio Code.

Now that you've got the authentication taken care of, you can start working on a project. Imagine you want to work a new project and you've started it on your local computer. You've created a new folder and added your first few files. It's good practice to back up this project on GitHub so that you can save versions of it over time as you continue to work on it or invite others to collaborate with you. 

## What does initializing a repository mean?

When you create a folder on your computer, you can initialize this folder as a local git repository. This will add a .git folder to your project and is how the Git version control system can keep track of actions and git commands. Typically, you do this by running the `git init` command in the terminal.

## What does publishing a repository mean?

After you've initialized a repository locally, you can choose to publish the repository to GitHub, a git provider that hosts your projects in the cloud. This way, you don't have to worry about your local machine running out of space or crashing, and you can also invite other contributors to work with you. Publishing your repository will connect the local repository you made and push the changes to GitHub's remote servers. This involves a few git commands, including adding a remote repository to your local one, pushing your local repository to the remote one, and authenticating with your GitHub credentials. 

## What will VS Code do?

VS Code provides a UI experience to initialize a repository, or publish it to GitHub (which will also initializes it for you). So you can start from a local folder on your computer to having a hosted project on GitHub with the push of a button and not worry about any additional Git commands.
