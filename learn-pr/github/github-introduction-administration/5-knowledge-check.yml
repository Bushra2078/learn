  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You want to grant a user the permissions required to add and remove organization members to a team. Which permission would you need to grant that user?"
    choices:
    - content: "The admin permission on a repository"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The admin permission on a repository only allows you to perform full administration-related tasks on a specific repository; it doesn't affect membership on a team."
    - content: "The maintain permission on a repository"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maintain permission on a repository only allows you to perform limited administration-related tasks on a specific repository; it doesn't affect membership on a team."
    - content: "Organization billing manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The organization billing manager permission only allows the user to handle billing related tasks; it doesn't affect membership on a team."
    - content: "Team maintainer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! As a team maintainer, the user can add and remove organization members to a team."
  - content: "As an organization owner, you want to ensure that everyone who is signed in to your corporate network can access the GitHub website without requiring a second sign-in. Which technology will you enable to accomplish this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Single sign-on"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Single sign-on is the right technology to allow network users to access the GitHub website without extra sign-ins."
    - content: "Two-factor authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Two-factor authentication requires each user to sign in by using a second means of identifying themselves, like using an authenticator app on their phones. It's not used in this scenario."
    - content: "SSH keys"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Personal Access Tokens provide access for the git client or web API by using a cryptographic key. You don't use them to access the GitHub website."
    - content: "Personal Access Tokens"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Personal Access Tokens provide access for the git client through a username and password. You don't use them to access the GitHub website."
  - content: "What's the appropriate repository permission level for contributors who will actively push changes to your repository?"
    choices:
    - content: "admin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The admin permission isn't appropriate because it provides too much access to the administration functions of the repository."
    - content: "write"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The write permission is the appropriate permission level."
    - content: "triage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The triage permission isn't appropriate because it's intended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without write access."
    - content: "maintain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maintain permission isn't appropriate because it's intended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions. It provides too much access for other users."
