GitHub administrators perform vital tasks to ensure that their organization's code and content assets are adequately protected while providing each team access to the repositories they rely on to collaborate and share their work.

Suppose you've been asked by your CIO for an adoption plan so that the entire company can benefit from GitHub.  You want to ensure every group has adequate access to the right repositories, and you want to ensure that there's a sustainable way to provide adequate permissions to the appropriate software development and content teams.  You will need to think through the kinds of tasks that administrators will need to perform, and assign the right level of access to the right administrators.  But first, you really need to understand what options are available to you from GitHub.

In this module, you will learn about the purpose and the administrative tasks at each hierarchical level.  You'll discover the various ways that administrators can configure authentication so that users can access GitHub via web browser and git client.  You'll learn about hierarchical permission levels and repository permissions, and what these permissions allow you to do in GitHub.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe GitHub's administrative tasks, hierarchical levels, permissions, and more.

## Learning objectives

- Describe how GitHub administrators can centrally manage teams and members using existing directory information services.
- Describe how GitHub can itself be used as an identity provider for authentication and authorization.

## Prerequisites
