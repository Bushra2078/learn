Our goal in this module was to develop a mental model of the roles and responsibilities for those users who perform administrations tasks for companies.  Whether it is setting up authentication schemes and enforcing organization or enterprise-wide policies, or designing cascading structures that represent the natural groupings within the company for the purpose of restricting access to appropriate repositories, GitHub supplies administrators the tools they need to flexibly control and protect the usage of their company's GitHub usage.

Hierarchical levels like Organizations, Teams, and Enterprises enable ways of setting up and controlling authentication and other security measures.  Permission levels allow for fine-grained control of specific tasks.  Repository permissions can be applied to individual users or teams of users, and cascade those permissions through child teams.

Without these types of administrative controls, it would be impossible to adequately secure a company's GitHub implementation.

GitHub administrators perform vital tasks that ensuring the security and viability of the repositories that each company relies on.
