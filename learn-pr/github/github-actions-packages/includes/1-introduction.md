Package registries allow developers to easily share and use code libraries as well as use them across development workstations. Some developers are already familiar with public package registries, like NPM or NuGet. Deploying private packages has a lot of similarities.

GitHub Packages allows development teams to share code libraries &mdash; NPM, NuGet, Maven, RubyGems &mdash; and containers directly within GitHub. These packages can be public or restricted to specific people using the same secure login for their code and packages. With GitHub Actions, you can automate
the packaging and publication of your code libraries and containers in minutes.

In this module, you'll learn how to leverage GitHub Actions to publish to GitHub Packages.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll:

- Understand what a Package Repository is and when to use it
- Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow with GitHub Actions to publish to GitHub Packages
- Validate your knowledge with an exercise that checks your ability to publish to a GitHub Packages registry
- Identify how to authenticate, install, and manage GitHub Packages

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of GitHub Actions
