Package registries enable developers to easily share and use code libraries as well as use them across development
workstations. Maybe developers are already familiar with public package registries, like NPM or NuGet. Deploying private
packages has a lot of similarities.

GitHub Packages allows development teams to share code libraries - NPM, NuGet, Maven, RubyGems - and containers
directly within GitHub. These packages can be public, or restricted to specific people using the same secure login
for their code and packages. With GitHub Actions, you can automate
the packaging and publication of your code libraries and containers in minutes.

In this module, you learn how to leverage GitHub Actions to publish to GitHub Packages.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand what a Package Repository is and when to use it.
- Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow with GitHub Actions to publish to GitHub Packages.
- Validate your knowledge with an exercise that checks your ability to publish to a GitHub Packages registry.
- Identify how to authenticate, install, and manage GitHub Packages.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge about GitHub Actions
