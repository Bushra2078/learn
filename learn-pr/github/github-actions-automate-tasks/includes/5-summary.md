In this module, you learned about GitHub Actions and how to use them in a workflow. 

You can now:

- Describe GitHub Actions, the types of actions, and where to find them
- Use GitHub Workflows to plan the automation of your software development life cycle
- Create a container action and have it run in a workflow triggered by a push event to your GitHub repository

## Next steps

To continue your journey with GitHub Actions, check out the next two modules on this learning path. There, you expand on what you've learned here and use GitHub Actions in continuous integration, continuous delivery, and implementing infrastructure as code.
