# Introduction

Imagine that you are the Github administrator for a project and you want to make sure that the code doesn't include any security vulnerabilities or errors. Manually verifying this, especially on a large code base, can be very time consuming. Your company just purchased a GitHub Advanced Security license that will help save time and effort by allowing you to use code scanning. With code scanning, you'll receive alerts indicating any problematic code, then you can quickly find the problem areas and make the necessary changes. In order to enable code scanning, you'll need to know what tools are available and what their features are. You'll also need to understand how often to perform code scanning and the types of events you can use to trigger scans.

This module introduces you to code scanning and its features. You will learn how to implement code scanning using CodeQL, third party tools, and GitHub Actions. You will also learn about the different ways you can configure code scanning to optimize your experience. 

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe code scanning
- List the steps for enabling code scanning in a repository
- List the steps for enabling code scanning with third party analysis
- Contrast how to implement CodeQL analysis in a GitHub Actions workflow versus a third party continuous integration (CI) tool
- Explain how to configure code scanning on a repository using triggering events
- Contrast the frequency of code scanning workflows(scheduled vs triggered by events)

## Prerequisites 

- A GitHub enterprise account with a GitHub Advanced Security license
- Familiarity with managing GitHub administrative settings
- Basic knowledge of GitHub Actions
