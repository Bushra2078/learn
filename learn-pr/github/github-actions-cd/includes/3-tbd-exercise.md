(Here's where we point to the Learning Lab on GitHub.)

(We should create boilerplate text that explains why:

* We're pointing you to GitHub Learning Lab (awesome integrated experience, directly in GitHub. Automated bot gives you feedback along the way.)
* Why you should come back here. (answer knowledge check questions, gain credit/badge for completing the module, learn about next steps.)

We discussed possibly having a video. What do you think?

(Provide a bit more context about the lab. Then consider using this button to make the CTA clear. I'm using `?azure-portal=true` to open the lab in a new tab.)
