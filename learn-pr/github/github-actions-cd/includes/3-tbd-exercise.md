In this exercise you'll use GitHub Learning Lab to create a GitHub repository for the exercise, trigger a continuous delivery workflow to deploy a containerized tic-tac-toe game web app to staging and production environments in Microsoft Azure, and automate the spin-up and tear-down of resources on Azure.

Be sure to try out the game when you have it deployed.

The GitHub Learning Lab has an easy to use integrated experience where you'll get feedback and instruction throughout the lab right in your GitHub repository.

Just a quick heads-up to make this exercise more enjoyable:

1. GitHub Learning Lab will be installed on your account in the first step of this lab. If you're asked, be sure to *install it on all repositories*. This will not affect the organizations that you're a member of, just the personal repositories that the lab creates for you.
1. After the install, you may be returned to their main page. To get back to your lab, just use the button on the bottom of this page again.
1. GitHub will create a repository for you to use. Give permissions to GitHub Learning Lab.
1. GitHub Learning Lab will set itself as a reviewer on your pull requests so that it can give you the next steps just in time. Sometimes reviewing your pull request will take a few minutes.
1. When you are given a link for creating or editing a file or told to open a tab, **be sure to open it in another tab in your browser**. This way you can come back to the instructions without leaving the file.
1. Comments and instructions will continue on your pull request or in an issue on your repository.
