Here we describe some of the benefits of the open-source community on GitHub.

## Setting your project and community up for success

You've decided to create an open-source program and folks have started to engage with it. What next? Building a welcoming community for your project is a long-term investment in your open-source program. Healthy, safe, and welcoming communities are the power behind the open-source ecosystem. People and their communities are often the main reason for folks to contribute -or not to contribute- to open source-projects.

As folks engage with and interact with your open-source projects, there will be some that will transition from users to contributors, and maintainers. The contributors' journey is crucial for any open-source project's sustainability.

Your goal when running an open-source program is to help reduce friction and enhance the contributors' experience. Even if someone is a casual or one-time contributor your job is making it easy to contribute to your project. A good starting point is setting expectations and ground-rules through the `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` files. Think of your project's README as the landing page for your project. Rather than a set of instructions to install your tool or framework.

Use your CONTRIBUTING to provide details about the type of contributions you're looking for and how you review and accept them. Also, explain the criteria for getting triage and commit rights to the repository.

## Open communication

Often, when working on an open-source project the documentation focus falls on technical documentation. A great way to include the community in your project is going beyond the technical docs. Items that can also be openly documented are: your project's roadmap and governance, contribution processes, and meeting minutes.

A great way to document important discussions and gather community and contributors' feedback is using [GitHub discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/about-team-discussions). This way you can start discussions with your team and the broader community. You can even reference these discussions in issues and Pull Requests.
Keeping communication public - except for certain cases such as code of conduct incidents - ensures everyone has the same information.

## Project community profiles on GitHub

To see how your project compares to community standards navigate to the main page of your repository. Under your repository name, select "Insights". In the left sidebar, select "Community". Most all files are right there to add. Think of adding templates for Issues and Pull Requests, further taking away barriers for people to report bugs, submit code, and just getting involved with your project.
