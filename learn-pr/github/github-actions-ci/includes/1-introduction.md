GitHub Actions can be used to implement continuous integration for code maintained in GitHub repositories. *Continuous integration* (CI) is the process of automating a software development team's build and test tasks so that they can be done quickly and often. This process helps elevate the team's performance by catching issues early allowing for more agility.

Suppose your are given the task of setting up continuous integration for your development team. The team is developing a web site to improve your customer's experience when seeking support for your product. The project will evolve as features are approved, so you want to make sure the team can build and test often to ensure quality and quickly integrate these features. Since the code for the project is stored in a GitHub repository, you decide to check out GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

In this module, you learn how to implement continuous integration using GitHub Actions and workflows in your GitHub repositories.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you:

- Build and test a Node.js project by using GitHub Actions and a templated workflow
- Debug a failed test using the GitHub Actions Log
- Customize your workflow with GitHub Actions to:
  - create a build artifact and save
  - get access to your build artifacts
  - test against multiple targets
  - add labels your pull requests

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub
  - For more information about GitHub, see [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github?azure-portal=true).
- Basic familiarity with GitHub Actions and workflows
  - If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Actions or GitHub Workflows, check out [Automate development tasks by using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/github/github-actions-hello/?azure-portal=true)
