In this exercise, you use GitHub Learning Lab to create a new repository that contains all of the necessary files for a Node.js project. Then, GitHub Learning Lab walks you through the process of using a template to create a CI workflow for the project. Finally, you'll customize the workflow.

GitHub Learning Lab has an easy-to-use integrated experience. You get feedback and instructionsg throughout the lab right in your GitHub repository.

A quick heads-up to make this exercise more enjoyable:

1. GitHub Learning Lab is installed on your account in the first step of this lab. If you are asked, be sure to *install it on all repositories*. This will not affect the organizations that you are a member of, only the personal repositories that the lab creates for you.
1. After the install, you may be returned to the main page. To get back to your lab, just use the button on the bottom of the page.
1. GitHub will create a repository for you to use. You need to give permissions to GitHub Learning Lab.
1. GitHub Learning Lab will set itself as a reviewer on your pull requests. This is so that it can give you the next steps at the appropriate time. Sometimes reviewing your pull request will take a few minutes. **TODO-what takes a few minutes, the review or the steps**
1. When you are given a link for creating or editing a file or told to open a tab, **be sure to open it in another tab in your browser**. This way you can come back to the instructions without leaving the file.
1. Comments and instructions will continue on your pull request or in an issue on your repository.
