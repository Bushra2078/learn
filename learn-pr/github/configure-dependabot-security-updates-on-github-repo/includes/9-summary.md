The goal of this module was to explain how you can use GitHub tools to help manage your dependencies and identify vulnerabilities that can affect the security of your project. 

GitHub Dependabot is enabled by default for all public repositories. You can also use the Dependabot features in private repositories by enabling the dependency graph and Dependabot. When enabled, Dependabot alerts notify you of vulnerabilities in your dependencies and security updates automatically generate pull requests that try to fix them. Version updates also automatically generate pull requests to update your dependencies to the latest nonbreaking version.

You learned how to configure your notifications based on how you want to receive alerts about vulnerabilities in your repository. You also learned how to use the security digest email as a concise way to receive a daily or weekly summary of alerts. 

Finally, you learned about dependency review and how to configure the dependency review action to analyze dependency changes on every pull request. Using these tools makes it easier to understand and manage your dependencies to better protect your projects on GitHub.
