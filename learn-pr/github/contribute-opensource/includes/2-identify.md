Here, we discuss how you can get started with open-source contributions. We'll also use issues and tags to find tasks to contribute to.

# Finding projects to contribute to on GitHub

There are many ways to contribute to open-source projects. The most common, and perhaps the easiest way to start is thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use.

Perhaps while reading a project's README you find a broken link, a typo or a series of outdated instructions. These are all great opportunities to pitch in and contribute to the project.
