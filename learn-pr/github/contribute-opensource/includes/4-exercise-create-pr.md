You've learned how to create a pull request when there's guidance - either in a pull request template, or in a `CONTRIBUTING` file. But what if a project doesn't (yet) offer that guidance and documentation on conventions? A best practice writing a commit message, and subsequentially your pull request, is the following: 

Your Git commit message subject line should complete the following sentence:
If applied, this commit `<will your subject line here>` 
It contains a succinct description of the change using the imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" nor "adds". Limit your subject line to 50 characters, start with a capital letter, and don't end with a period (.). You can use emoji in your subject line, and `@`-mention other GitHub users, although not everyone is a fan of such frivolity.  

For the body of your message and pull request, continue to use present tense, and make sure to include the motivation for the change. Contrast this with the previous behavior. Use the real estate at your disposal to explain the *what* and *why* vs. the *how*.

Your commit message is only as to the point as the content that you're about to submit. Commit / submit for review small, isolated sets of changes. This also increases the likelihood of your changes getting merged into the project. 

## Exercise
With the lessons from the previous module and the above in mind, now go back to a pull request you opened recentlt (or: navigate to the pull requests tab of a project you're watching), and find out how a good subject line can make all the difference. Consider updating a pull request accordingly.
