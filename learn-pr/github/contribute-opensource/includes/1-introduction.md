Open-source software heavily relies on the community for its long-term sustainability. One way to contribute to open-source projects is by making contributions to the project's repository and conducting code reviews.

Suppose you have been using open-source libraries for your projects and at work for quite some time. In the spirit of open-source, you have decided to contribute back to some of these libraries and frameworks.

You first need to find a project to contribute to on GitHub as well as familiarize yourself with the project and its community standards. You will also need to identify tasks to contribute to and learn the best practices to submit your contributions.
As you contribute to the project, you realize that a crucial part is to communicate with the project's maintainers, ask for help and review your contributions. You might want to immerse yourself in the project's community further and connect with other contributors.
And as you contribute to one project, you might find other projects could also benefit from a similar feature or API. And you might release an open-source project yourself. We just made a full circle!

In this module, you will learn how to submit a successful contribution to an open-source project on GitHub by adopting assistance best practices.
