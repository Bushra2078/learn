## Get involved in the community
You've added context to an issue, contributed a code review, maybe even submitted a pull request of your own. Now you want to immerse yourself further in the community around the project. You'll find frequent contributors to the project in the comment section for issues and pull requests, or you can select "Insights" in the repository's navigation, and then select "Contributors" to find other active community members. Visit their GitHub profiles, sometimes they'll suggest ways to get in touch with them.

You can also find likeminded folks by attending meetups or conferences on open source (topics), or - when the project or ecosystem is big enough - around the project you're interested in. Find (archives with) talk recordings for events past, podcasts, newsletters, mailing lists...

Some projects have centralized communication, often referenced on the project's website or in the README - a Discord server, Slack community, Gitter, IRC, regular "Office Hours", you name it! 

## Code-reusability
Code, and solutions, can sometimes be reused across projects. Solved a very scoped issue for one project? Chances are other projects can benefit from it as well! You can:
- Publish as a stand-alone library (dependency), 
- Mirror the project with your added functionality, 
- Or [create a GitHub Action](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/github-actions-automate-tasks/) for others to include in their workflow

The first option is probably the best course of action when your bit of code is like a plugin that could be used across web development projects. Mirroring or forking a project with the addition of your code is useful when you're solving a narrow use case for a small subset of customers, or even a single customer. Consider that you'll need to keep your fork up to date with the upstream repository if you want to benefit from for instance security patches. 

GitHub Actions are packaged scripts that automate tasks in a software development workflow in GitHub. The 2 different types of Actions are container actions and JavaScript actions. You can submit your Action to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) for discoverability.

For all three of the suggested paths, consider that you're now a maintainer of a project. People will come to you with praise, questions, and... complaints. Are you ready for such a commitment? If your project takes off people's apps might depend on your bit of code. Can you involve more people to take some of the potential load off? Do you have time to add documentation, triage issues, and review suggestions from people you've likely never met before? Consider your "bandwidth", and rather set expectations in your project's README, or release your code in a public "Gist", or in a blog post. Code doesn't need to be on GitHub to be open source after all.
