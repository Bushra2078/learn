In this module, you learned how to find projects to contribute to on GitHub. You discovered how to familiarize yourself with the project and its guidelines. We covered how to use the issue tracker and labels to find tasks to work on. You read about how to communicate effectively with project maintainers and how to conduct code reviews. You also learned that via GitHub Sponsors you can financially support your favorite projects and open-source contributors.

You learned that writing a succinct description of the changes you make to a project using the imperative, present tense, and explaining the _what_ and _why_ vs. the _how_, increases the likelihood of your changes getting merged. You can look for opportunities to re-use the code you've written for one project, as long as your library / piece of code solves a very scoped problem.
