In this unit, we discuss how you can get started with open-source contributions. We'll also use issues and tags to find tasks to contribute to.

There are many ways to contribute to open-source projects. Making your first contribution can often be a scary experience. But it shouldn't be. Open-source is a place for everyone and contributions happen at all levels.

## Finding a open-source project that needs contributions

You can get started by thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use. Contributing is easier when you're familiar with the project and its community.

Perhaps while reading a project's README you find a broken link or some typos. Maybe you noticed something isn't working as expected or the documentation is out of date. These are all great opportunities to help and contribute to the project.

> [!TIP]
> One important tip: **all** kinds of contributions are valuable. Your level of experience or knowledge of the project does not matter here, we all have something we can contribute. Be confident in yourself, the most important thing here is the will to help.

## Using GitHub search

You can also use GitHub search to explore topics and related projects.
You can head to [https://github.com/search](https://github.com/search) and type your topic word.

Let's say you're interested in Machine Learning.

You can then narrow your search clicking on **Topics** on the left sidebar.

From there, you can find repositories relevant to your search keyword and repositories curated by community members.

## Familiarizing with an open-source project

Something worth mentioning here is that every open-source community is different. After you've found a project, you'll need to familiarize with the project and its participation guidelines.

Most projects will have these documents at the top level of the repository.

- **LICENSE**: the project must contain an [open-source license](https://choosealicense.com/). If the project doesn't have a license, it's not open source.
- **README**: the README usually serves as the welcome page for the project. It usually provides information on how to get started using the project. It's also common for it to add information on how to engage with the community.
- **CONTRIBUTING**: as its name suggests this document provides guidance on how to contribute to the project. It usually describes how the contribution process works and details on how to set your development environment.
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT**: the code of conduct sets ground rules for community members. By doing so, it helps make the community a safe and welcoming environment for all.

Though not all projects have a CONTRIBUTING or CODE OF CONDUCT, having these documents is a good indication of how friendly and welcoming a project is.

Open-source contributors and maintainers come from all over the world. Projects usually have multiple communication channels to organize discussions and ask for help.
A good way to familiarize yourself with the community is reading through some of these communication channels.

- **Issue tracker**: where folks discuss issues and tasks related to the project. To find the issues in GitHub, you can navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub and add `/issues` to the end of the URL (for example [https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues)).
- **Pull Request**: where folks discuss and reviews changes to the project. You can find it in GitHub by adding `pulls` to the project's URL (for example [https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pulls](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pulls)).
- **Chat channels and forums**: some projects use chat channels (such as Slack, Gitter, and IRC) or forums (such as Discourse) for conversations and discussions.

## Identifying tasks to work on

Great, you have found a project, read the contribution guidelines and now you're ready to submit your contribution!

Perhaps you've already identified something to work on such as fixing broken links or update the docs. A good way to find beginner-friendly issues to help with is visiting the project's `/contribute` URL (for example [https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/contribute](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/contribute)).

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-contribute.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Contribute to a project' section on GitHub":::

You'll notice that most of the issues displayed in the `contribute` URL will have labels such as `good-first-issue`, `help wanted`, `beginner-friendly`, and so on. Labels are often used to provide top-level information of the issue and the type of help needed.

You can head to the labels page (for example [https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/labels](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/labels)) and select issues that have labels like `help wanted`, `discussion`, or other relevant labels to the type of contribution you're interested in.

As you explore issues, you might also notice that some have other issues or pull requests linked.

## Sponsoring a project

There are many ways to contribute to open source. You can financially support the folks who build and maintain the open-source ecosystem through code, leadership, mentorship, design, and beyond.

Open source heavily relies on volunteer work. GitHub Sponsors allow you to fund projects and individuals. To help them keep doing their open-source work, while giving them the recognition they deserve.

If a project is eligible for sponsorship through GitHub sponsors, you'll find a **Sponsor** button on the project's main page.

You can select the sponsorship tier and if you want your contribution to be public.

## Unit Recap

In this unit, you learned how to get started with open-source contributions. From choosing a project to work on to use GitHub issues and labels to identify tasks to work on.

Here is a handy checklist when interacting with a project for the first time:

- Does it have a license?
- Are issues and pull requests discussions used actively by maintainers and contributors?
- Does the project use labels like `help wanted` or `good first issue` for newcomers?
- Does the project have a Code of Conduct?
- Does the project have clear Contributing Guidelines?

Finally, remember that all contributions are welcome, and the open-source ecosystem greatly benefits from your ideas and participation.
There are many ways to contribute to open source, from submitting code or engaging in project discussions to sponsoring projects through GitHub sponsors.
