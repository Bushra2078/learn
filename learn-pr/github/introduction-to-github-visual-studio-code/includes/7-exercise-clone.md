Let's see how you can use Visual Studio Code to start a new project by cloning the project from an existing repository on GitHub.

## Clone a new repository from GitHub

1. Open a new VS Code window. From the File Explorer view, you can click on **Clone Repository**. You should see an option to clone from GitHub.

2. Select the **Clone from GitHub** option from the dropdown and you will find a list of your repositories. You can also search for other repositories on Github. Search for a repository using this path "MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-python-products" and select the first option.

3. Choose a location on your computer where you want the repository to be cloned into.
4. Select **Open** from the pop-up that appears after VS Code has cloned the repository:

## Comparing changes in commit history to gain context

1. Open the `README.md` file from the file explorer. Once you have the file in the editor, expand the **Timeline** Pane

7. Select the commit made by the user *Burke Holland*. This will open a read-only diff view so you can see all the changes associated with the commit. The green highlight shows that Burke has added those lines to the original content
