In this exercise, you'll authenticate to GitHub using Visual Studio Code. You'll also learn how to control your signed-in status and which extensions in Visual Studio Code can use your authentication.

## 1 - Install extension and sign in to GitHub

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code installed. From the **Help** menu, select **Check for Updates**, and then install the latest version, if necessary.

2. Select the extensions icon on the activity bar. Search for the **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** extension and install it.

4. Select **Authorize Visual-Studio-Code**.

   > [!TIP]
   > Depending on the browser you're using, you may be prompted to allow `https://vscode.dev` to open the application. Select **Open** to continue.

  Your Visual Studio Code window reopens, and you're signed in. You can double check by selecting the account icon again and seeing your GitHub username.

## 2 - Manage trusted GitHub extensions

1. To see all the extensions that are using your GitHub account, select the account icon, select your GitHub username, and choose **Manage Trusted Extensions**.
