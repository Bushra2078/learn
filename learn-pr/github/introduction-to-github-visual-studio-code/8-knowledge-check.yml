        - content: "Right-click the extension and select 'Manage Trusted Extensions'"

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While this will work, it's an extra step that isn't required."
        - content: "Right-click files and select 'Add to .gitignore'."

          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Deselecting items to publish when prompted after initiating the publish process will automatically create a .gitignore file and add the deselected files."
    - content: "How do you set the 'origin' remote for a repository that you clone from Visual Studio Code"
      choices:
        - content: "It is set automatically by Visual Studio Code."

        - content: "It is set automatically by Git."
          isCorrect: false
