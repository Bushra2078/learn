# User Authentication

Here, you'll learn about two recommended authentication systems employed by GitHub Enterprises, and how to perform a basic but important 2FA audit for user compliance.

When it comes to user authentication, security should be the number one thing that comes to mind. Strong security is essential. It seems like every month or so a company reports a data breach or some credentials being stolen due to inefficient security processes or simply a lack of up-to-date security features. Establishing secure user authentication can be a difficult task if user adoption requires long and frustrating steps to authenticate. Ask any security professional and they'll mention several ways that companies authenticate their users.

But, there are two recommended authentication methods which can be implemented when authenticating your users on GitHub; SAML SSO and multi-factor authentication, also known as 2FA.

## Authentication with SAML SSO

SAML authentication is a process used to verify user identity and credentials against a known identify provider. Now days, your company may likely already be using this. If so, you can link your existing IdP to GitHub for user sign-in management. Below is a high-level overview of the process that occurs with enabled SAML SSO within your GitHub Enterprise.

- Before enabling SAML SSO with your GitHub Enterprise, an Administrator needs to connect the GitHub organization to a supported IdP.
- Next, when a member accesses resources within an organization that uses SAML SSO, GitHub redirects the member to the IdP to authenticate.
- After successful authentication, the IdP redirects the member back to GitHub where the member can access the organization's resources. This means that even after configuring SAML SSO, members of the GitHub organization will continue to be prompted to log into their user accounts on GitHub.

### Enforce SAML SSO for your organization

It's important to note that if you have enabled SAML SSO across your organization, you will need to enforce authentication after the setting has been enabled in order to make it an authentication requirement. As the organization administrator, you do this by selecting *Your organizations*, then click on *Settings*, and then choose *Organization security*. Under SAML single sign on, select *Require SAML SSO authentication for all members of the organization*.

After you enforce authentication for an organization, GitHub will then remove any members of the organization that have not yet authenticated successfully with your SAML IdP.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that GitHub will not remove members of the _enterprise_ that have not yet authenticated successfully with your SAML IdP. The member will be prompted to authenticate with your SAML IdP the next time the member accesses the enterprise's resources or tries to authenticate after the setting has been enabled.

## Multi-factor authentication or 2FA

Two-Factor authentication is an additional level of security available to GitHub Enterprise accounts. With 2FA, a member in your organization is required to log in with username and password, and also provide a secondary form of authentication which only they know or have access to. You can require organization members, outside collaborators, and billing managers to enable two-factor authentication for their personal accounts by selecting an organization security setting.

Keep in mind that before you can require organization members, outside collaborators, or billing managers to use two-factor authentication, they must enable two-factor authentication setting for their account on GitHub. You will need to communicate this requirement to your team via email or some other means of communication.

> [!warning]
> When you require the use of two-factor authentication for your organization, all accounts that do not use 2FA will be removed from the organization and lose access to its repositories. This includes bot accounts.

For more detailed information about 2FA, see [Securing your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

### Options to identify with 2FA

Only users who legitimately need access to your organization's data should have it. Insufficient data security could lead to an attack to breach of important data. One way to ensure that your organization is meeting basic security requirements can be accomplished by enabling 2FA. When you require 2FA, a malicious actor needs more than just a user's password and username to access an account. 2FA makes it much harder for malicious actors to access your organization's data because they do not have access to the physical devices of your users.

The codes used for 2FA expire in a short amount of time. Once expired, the login attempt is no longer valid and the access request is canceled. By enabling 2FA, your user's accounts will be better protected from malicious attacks and data breaches. In your GitHub enterprise, your users have three ways that they can authenticate with 2FA; security keys, TOTP, and SMS.

#### Security Keys

With security keys, your enterprise can achieve a higher level of user security and protection. With two-factor authentication enabled, security keys provide a strong, convenient, and phishing-proof option for 2FA. Authentication with a security key requires that TOTP or SMS authentication has already been completed. On most devices, you can use a physical security key over USB or NFC. A user can register a new security key through accessing their profile setting following the security keyâ€™s documentation. Utilizing these keys is the most secure form of 2FA, because they are nearly impossible for a malicious party to replicate. When using a security key, none of the sensitive information ever leaves the physical security key device. Authentication with a security key is the most secure way to authenticate, but it's secondary to authentication with a TOTP application or a text message, so your users will need to complete one of the following authentication methods to be able to configure the key.

#### TOTP

GitHub recommends using a cloud based TOTP app to configure 2FA. TOTP applications are more reliable than SMS, especially for locations outside the United States. TOTP apps support the secure backup of your authentication codes in the cloud, and can be restored if you lose access to your device.

#### SMS

If your users are not able to authenticate using a TOTP mobile app, they can authenticate using SMS messages. This form of 2FA relies on the assumption that the user is the only person with access to their mobile device. GitHub does not support authentication via SMS in all countries. Before an Administrator allows users to authenticate via SMS, they should confirm it is supported in the country where the users are located.

### Audit 2FA for User Compliance

You can review which organization owners, members, and outside collaborators have enabled two-factor authentication by navigating to the right corner of GitHub.com, click your profile photo, click **Your organizations**, then select the name of the desired organization. Under the organization name, click on the **People** tab and then select the **2FA** option. From here, you'll be able to see which members in the organization have enabled two-factor authentication as well as outside contributors.

Revoking access for users in your enterprise who are not compliant is possible, but you will need to contact them outside of GitHub to relay the reason they no longer have access to your organization. Communication to non-compliant users is traditionally done through email notification.
