User authentication has traditionally been achieved using a User ID and password. A password is a single factor form of authentication. The fundamental issue with single factor authentication is that it's easier for any bad actor with knowledge of the sign-on information to impersonate the valid user. To prevent a breach of security for a user account, there are authentication tools available on GitHub to promote security best practices and even enforce a security policy for all GitHub users with the organization.

Controlling access to your company's data is foundational for a secure GitHub Enterprise. GitHub is committed to helping enterprises on their security journey, and has additional authentication practices to allow for more secure account access and a better user experience. In a GitHub Enterprise, most organizations want to require additional levels of authentication for better security. Enterprise System Administrators can enforce authentication and authorization security policies across an organization. This allows you to ensure that users are required to sign on securely to access the correct permissions in repositories. This also includes access and tools for auditing user access and activity, identity maintenance, and authentication compliance. As an administrator, you should work with your internal resources to identify what type of authentication and authorization is appropriate. This module provides an overview of the authentication and authorization options available to you in your GitHub organization or GitHub Enterprise.
