<!--GitHub Administration for Enterprise support and adoption-->

As your organization's GitHub administrator, one of your responsibilities is to take advantage of the tools GitHub provides to large businesses. GitHub Enterprise packages these tools in one place, with features to improve operations for organizations with hundreds or thousands of employees, rapid arrival and departure of collaborators, and international clientele.

Suppose your organization lands a major software development contract, it'll need to expand its workforce and capabilities right away. However, with greater headcount comes more authentication and more code that will require review for critical errors and vulnerabilities. Your organization's leaders have decided that GitHub's Enterprise package provides the necessary enhanced service. As an administrator, you need to assist with the setup of the Enterprise automation and upkeep tools.

In this module, you'll learn how GitHub Enterprise can make your administrative duties easier.
