Software security is always an important topic, and it spans the entire software development lifecycle. While much focus is afforded to the process of writing secure code and locking down infrastructure, it's as important to protect the processes that happen elsewhere in DevOps. 

Suppose you are managing an important GitHub repository. You want to enforce the highest level of security, but also want to offer a welcoming experience for contributors. Unfortunately, being secure often introduces friction that hampers everyone's productivity. To mitigate this overhead, GitHub offers a variety of automated features that enable you to efficiently administer a secure repository without slowing everyone down.

In this module, you learn how to build, host, and maintain a secure GitHub repository.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Enable vulnerable dependency detection for private repositories
- Detect and fix outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities
- Automate the detection of vulnerable dependencies with Dependabot
- Add a security policy with a `SECURITY.md` file
- Remove a commit exposing sensitive data in a pull request
- Keep sensitive files out of your repository by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file
- Remove historical commits exposing sensitive data deep in your repository

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub

It is recommended that you complete [Introduction to GitHub](/learn/modules/introduction-to-github) before beginning this module.
