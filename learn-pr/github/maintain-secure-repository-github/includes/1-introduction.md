Software security is always an important topic, and it spans the entire software development lifecycle. While much focus is afforded to the process of writing secure code and locking down infrastructure, it's as important to protect the processes that happen elsewhere in the lifecycle.

Suppose you are managing an important GitHub repository. You want to enforce the highest level of security, but also want to offer a welcoming experience for contributors. Unfortunately, being secure often introduces friction that hampers everyone's productivity. To mitigate this overhead, GitHub offers a variety of automated features that enable you to efficiently administer a secure repository without slowing everyone down.

In this module, you learn how to build, host, and maintain a secure GitHub repository.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Recognize the importance of securing your repository and shifting left in the development lifecyle
- Identify the tools, GitHub features, and best practices to establish a secure development strategy
- Keep sensitive files out of your repository by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file
- Identify how to detect and fix outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities
- Recognize additional security features for advanced code scanning and secret scanning


## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub
