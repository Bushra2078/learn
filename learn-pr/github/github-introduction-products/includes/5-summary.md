Your goal in this module was to understand and then describe GitHub's various products, features, and licensing terms.

To accomplish this goal, you learned about the intricate nature of the relationships between plans, account types, teams, repository permissions, and organization permission levels.  You learned about each product in depth, reviewing each feature that is available with each option, how it is priced, and certain additional licensing consideration for metered or per-use services.

Without completely understanding GitHub's products and licensing, you may not be provisioning and optimizing your GitHub usage within your organization.  Conversely, understanding GitHub's products, features, and licensing has a significant impact on its usage inside of your organization.
