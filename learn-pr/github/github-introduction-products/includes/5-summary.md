Your goal of this module was to understand and then describe GitHub's various products, features, and licensing terms.

To accomplish this goal, you learned how plans, account types, teams, repository permissions, and organization permission levels are all connected.  You learned about each product, reviewing features available with each option and how they are priced. You also learned about some additional licensing considerations for metered or per-use services.

Without completely understanding GitHub's products and licensing, you may not be provisioning and optimizing your GitHub usage within your organization.  Conversely, understanding GitHub's products, features, and licensing has a significant impact on its usage inside of your organization.
