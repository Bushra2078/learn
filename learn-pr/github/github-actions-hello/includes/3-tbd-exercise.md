In this exercise you'll use GitHub Learning Lab to create a GitHub repo, a container action that will print a greeting in the action's log file, and a workflow that triggers on a push to this repo.

The GitHub Learning Lab has an easy to use integrated experience where you'll get feedback and instruction throughout the lab right in your GitHub repo.

Just a quick heads-up to make this exercise more enjoyable:

1. You'll need to install GitHub Labs on your account in the first step of this lab. Be sure to *install it on all repositories*. This will not affect the organizations that you are a member of, just the personal repositories that the lab creates for you.
1. After you install GitHub Labs, you will be returned to their main page. To get back to your lab, just use the button on the bottom of this page again.
1. GitHub will create a repo for you to use. You'll need to give permissions to GitHub Labs.
1. GitHub Labs will set itself as a reviewer on your pull requests. This is so that it can give you the next steps just in time. Sometimes this will take a few minutes.
1. When you are given a link for creating or editing a file, **be sure to open that link in another tab**. This way you can come back to the instructions without leaving the file.
1. Comments and instructions will continue on your pull request or in an issue on your repo.
