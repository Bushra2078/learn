In this module, you learned about GitHub Actions and how to use them in a workflow. 

You can now:

- Describe GitHub Actions, the types of actions, and where to find them
- Plan an automation of your software development life cycle with GitHub Workflows
- Create a container action and have it run in a workflow triggered by a push event to your GitHub repository
