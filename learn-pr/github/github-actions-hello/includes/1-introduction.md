GitHub Actions help your software development team to be agile and competitive in today's marketplace by allowing you to automate your software development lifecycle tasks. 

Suppose you manage a team that is developing a web site to improve your customer's experience when seeking support for your product. This is an important project to upper management and they want a high quality site published quickly. You need to ensure your team is producing code that builds, is tested, and can be deployed quickly when a feature finishes development. On top of that, your IT department would like to automate creating and destroying the infrastructure this project will need. You decide to use *continuous integration* (CI) and *continuous delivery* (CD) to automate the build, test, and deploy tasks, and *infrastructure as code* (IaC) to automate IT's needs.

There are several tools to choose from to help you achieve this goal. Since you are using GitHub for your code repository, you decide to investigate GitHub Actions to provide the automation you need.

In this module, you are introduced to GitHub Actions and GitHub Workflows. In subsequent modules, you will use what you learn here to implement continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Describe GitHub Actions, the types of actions, and where to find them
- Plan an automation of your software development life cycle with GitHub Workflows
- Create a container action and have it run in a workflow triggered by a push event to your GitHub repository

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub](https://github.com?azure-portaql=true) account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub
  - (For more information about GitHub, see [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github?azure-portal=true).)
