GitHub Actions help your software development team to be agile and competitive in today's marketplace by allowing you to automate your software development lifecycle tasks. 

Suppose you manage a team that is developing a web site to improve your customers' experience when they contact product support. This project is important to upper management. They want a high-quality site and they want to publish it soon. You need to ensure your team is producing code that builds, is tested, deploys quickly when a feature finishes development. On top of that, your IT department would like to automate creation and tear down of the project's infrastructure. You decide to use *continuous integration* (CI) and *continuous delivery* (CD) to automate the build, test, and deployment tasks. You're also going to adopt *infrastructure as code* (IaC) to automate IT tasks.

There are several tools to choose from to help you achieve this goal. Since you are using GitHub for your code repository, you decide to investigate GitHub Actions to see if it provides the automation you need.

In this module, you are introduced to GitHub Actions and workflows. In subsequent modules, you will use what you learn here to implement continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Describe GitHub Actions, the types of actions, and where to find them
- Plan an automation of your software development life cycle with GitHub Actions workflows
- Create a container action and have it run in a workflow

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub](https://github.com?azure-portaql=true) account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub
  - (For more information about GitHub, see [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github?azure-portal=true).)
