  questions:
  - content: What is GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)?
    choices:
    - content: "An automated tool for managing project dependencies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of Dependabot, not GHAS."
    - content: "An application security solution that empowers developers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GHAS is a security solution that empowers developers by embedding security features into their workflow to help prevent vulnerabilities and credential leaks in source code."
    - content: "A tool for analyzing source code for security vulnerabilities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of code scanning, which is a part of GHAS, but not the full definition of GHAS itself."
    - content: "A platform for tracking the full impact of changes to dependencies in a project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of Dependency Review, a feature of Dependabot within GHAS, but not the full definition of GHAS."
  - content: "How does code scanning contribute to the security of a software development project?"
    choices:
    - content: "By preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is more related to secret scanning, not code scanning."
    - content: "By automating the management of project dependencies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of Dependabot, not code scanning."
    - content: "By analyzing source code for potential coding errors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a general description of static analysis, which is a technique used in code scanning, but it does not fully describe the contribution of code scanning to security."
    - content: "By analyzing source code for potential coding errors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a general description of static analysis, which is a technique used in code scanning, but it does not fully describe the contribution of code scanning to security."
  - content: "Which GitHub feature is powered by CodeQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "Code scanning"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "CodeQL runs queries that scan code for errors."
    - content: "Dependabot"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Dependabot ensures the reliability of dependencies."
    - content: "The GitHub Advisory Database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The GitHub Advisory Database keeps track of vulnerabilities in dependencies."
  - content: "What does the term 'shifting left' mean?"
    choices:
    - content: "Embedding security team members into development teams."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although security teams should collaborate with other teams, this isn't the meaning of 'shifting left' ."
    - content: "Implementing security best practices after reviews are completed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Security shouldn't be considered as an isolated, post-development exercise."
    - content: "Incorporating security principles early in the software development lifecycle"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Security should be considered at each development phase."
  - content: "Which technology does GitHub use to authenticate one application with another?"
    choices:
    - content: "Branches"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Branches are a copy of the repository for a developer to use."
    - content: "Secrets"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Secrets are encrypted authentication keys."
    - content: "Environment variable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Environment variables aren't used for authentication."
  - content: "What's a common cause of security breaches?"
    choices:
    - content: "Users remove packages from projects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Package removal isn't a common cause of security breaches."
    - content: "Developers share their code with other developers outside their organization."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sharing code isn't a common cause of security breaches."
    - content: "Administrators delay patching a system after updates are available."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Failing to promptly patch a system leaves it vulnerable to attacks or exploits."
