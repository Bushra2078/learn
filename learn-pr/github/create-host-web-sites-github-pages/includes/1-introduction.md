GitHub Pages are free static web sites hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Using standard technologies like YAML and Markdown, anyone can build and maintain a site in minutes.

Suppose you want to set up a basic web site to share information about the project you're working on. It might be a personal site, like as resume or portfolio. Or it might be a professional site, like a user guide or developer reference. With GitHub Pages, you can spin the site up in minutes and enable anyone with a basic understanding of Markdown to contribute to it. You also get all the benefits of GitHub for source control, including branches and pull requests.

In this module, you learn how to set up and use GitHub Pages to host both personal and professional sites.
