In this module, you learned how to install the CodeQL CLI, set up a database for CodeQL, and run a CodeQL analysis in this database. You learned about the QL language, uploading SARIF files, and the requirements for 3rd party tools to upload SARIF results. You also reviewed information about how to understand the CodeQL scan results and navigate alerts within the code scanning console window. Finally, the module discussed how to troubleshoot common problems and best practices for CodeQL and the QL language.
