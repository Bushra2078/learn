In this module, you learned about phishing, how to identify it and what to do if you receive an email that looks suspicious. 

You learned about what makes a good password. You learned how to use passphrases to make your credentials even more secure, why you should ensure you use a unique password for each account, and how to store your credentials securely in a password manager.

You also learned about how to add an additional layer of security to your accounts by using multi-factor authentication. 

What should you do now? Get started securing yourself today by taking the following action:

1. Install a password manager and go through the setup instructions.
1. Set up MFA on your password manager.
