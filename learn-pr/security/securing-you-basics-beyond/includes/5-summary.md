In this module, you learned about phishing, how to identify it and what to do if you receive an email that looks suspicious.

You learned how to use passphrases to make your credentials even more secure, why you should ensure you use a unique password for each account, and how to store your credentials securely in a password manager.

You also learned about how to add an additional layer of security to your accounts by using multi-factor authentication.

What should you do now? Get started securing yourself today by taking the following actions:

- Install a password manager and go through the setup instructions.
- Configure MFA for your password manager.
- Change any passwords or passphrases for accounts where you used the same ones, and store the new ones in your password manager.
