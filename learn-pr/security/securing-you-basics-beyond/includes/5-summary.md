In this training session, we explored:

- Avoiding phishing 
- Creating and using strong passphrases
- Why every account needs a unique password
- Password managers and how they should be used to securely store your passwords and secrets
- Why multi-factor authentication is a great way to add another layer of security to your accounts 

What should you do now? Get started securing yourself today by:

1. Installing a password manager and go through the setup instructions. 
1. Setting up MFA on your password manager.
1. Getting started on changing any passwords or passphrases for accounts where you may have used the same ones previously. 
    1. Set up MFA on those accounts, too!

As our online neighborhood continues to evolve, it is always important to continue learning. The strategies shared here may change over time, and so should our understanding of how to secure our identities.

The resources below highlight additional areas to explore, and even more ways to secure yourself online. As security truly starts with us, the more knowledge and understanding we have around securing our personal information, the harder it will be for criminals to get access to it.
