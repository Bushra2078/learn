There is way to add another, very strong layer of security to your account credentials. Let's review how *multi-factor authentication (MFA)*, sometimes referred to as *two-factor authentication (2FA)*, can protect your accounts much better than just using a password or passphrase, even after a data breach.

## Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - easier than it sounds

Having complex and unique passphrases and passwords is a great step toward securing your accounts. But that still doesn't protect you if a company has a data breach and exposes your password. For this type of scenario, you can improve your accounts' security even more by using MFA. This approach gives you another different, effective layer of security.

Let's begin with *factors*. A factor in this scenario is just a type of secret. Using MFA means using *more than one type of secret* to verify your identity. It’s like having another type of password required to sign in, after providing the first password.

There are three general types of factors:

- *A thing you know*: A password, passphrase, or personal identification number (PIN).
- *A thing you have*: Your smartphone or a special USB security device.
- *A thing you are*: Biometric information such as your fingerprint or your face (often used to as a way to unlock a smartphone).

Let's look at an example of using MFA to log into an account:

- You enter your user name. This is your identity.
- You enter your password. This is the first factor, something you know.
- You tap an approval button on a smartphone app. The phone and the app are the second factor, something you have.

In the example, you used MFA to log into an account with two factors: a password and an app on a physical device you had in your possession.

## Why MFA?

Why is MFA so important? As we mentioned earlier, billions of records have been leaked over the last few years. Let’s assume one of your usernames and passwords has been leaked. If you don’t use MFA, a criminal could take that username and password combination and log into one of your accounts and do bad things.

This is where MFA increases the security of your account. Even if your username and password have been stolen or leaked, *if you have MFA turned on*, your account information should still be safe. Why? Because nobody can log in without that last step. The thief may have your username and password, but not the other factor. It’s like another password, but one that is stored differently, not with the other information that is frequently stolen. Many reputable services now encourage or even require that you turn on MFA. But even if they don't, you should turn on and use MFA wherever you can.

Unless you are a special target of very capable criminals, anyone intending to abuse your username and password will not have access to your fingerprints, your phone, or your USB security device. Just having an additional factor as a part of logging into any of your accounts adds a layer of security that most criminals will not be able to work around.

When the next data breach occurs and more usernames and passwords are exposed to the world, all you will need to do is change the passwords for those accounts. Depending on the type of breach or attack, if you have MFA turned on, your data should still be secure.

What is the most important thing you should secure using MFA? Your password manager! All reputable password managers allow you to set up MFA to keep your secrets as secure as possible.

> [!TIP]
> You should always use MFA with any accounts that allow it. If you don't like the idea of using an app on your smartphone, Yubico makes an easy-to-use device called a [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/?azure-portal=true). These can be used as very effective personal security devices for supporting MFA-enabled accounts.

## MFA apps and other options

How do you set up MFA? Follow the instructions for the account you want to secure. While they may be slightly different from account to account, they should provide clear, easy-to-follow instructions, and most of them will show you how to set up and use an authenticator app on your smartphone, such as [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator/?azure-portal=true). If you're not sure where to start, look in your account's security settings for terms like "MFA", "2FA" (two-factor authentication), or "multi-step verification".

Your account may require a specific authenticator application, or it may give you the option to choose from several. Use the option that works best for you.

Lastly, please note that your account may only give you the option to use cell phone text messages to receive a *one-time code* for use with MFA. This works by generating a new code each time you attempt to log in. You will be required to enter that code each time in order to finish logging in. While this is not as secure as using an authenticator application on your phone, since text messages can be intercepted, it is still much better than not using MFA at all. If that’s your only available option, you should still use it.

If you enable MFA for every account you can, your accounts will be even more secure that if you use a strong password or passphrase. The extra security this gives your account is definitely worth the extra couple of seconds it will take to sign in.
