As you probably know, staying secure online is a challenge. The Internet and devices connected to it are constantly changing, adapting to modern advancements in technology. Unfortunately, the criminals keep changing their tactics too, adapting to the same advancements that make using the internet more convenient.

If you think about the Internet as a neighborhood, one where you do common tasks such as email, banking, or shopping, you should think about who your *neighbors* are. Some of these neighbors are dangerous. They include organized crime gangs intent on stealing personal account information, hackers who will use your computers to attack other victims, automated downloads that install malicious software to keep you from using your computer until you pay (ransomware), and even government-backed hackers who may be on a mission to steal intellectual property or destabilize governments.

While most of your online activity probably doesn’t directly expose you to crime, odds are good that you know someone who has been a victim of some kind of computer-related crime, including computer viruses, malware, identity theft, or data breaches. If it hasn’t happened to you and if you don’t protect yourself, it’s just a matter of time before you will be directly affected. So what can you do to keep yourself safe, without having to be a cybersecurity expert?

We have good news! Securing your passwords, account information, and other sensitive data may be easier than you think. We will show you simple steps you can take to protect yourself from the most common threats active today.

In addition, we have designed these steps to be easily shared with friends and family! If you’re the kind of person who likes to help others, we’ll be sharing a simple set of tools and techniques you can pass along (including the link to this training, of course).
