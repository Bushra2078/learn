The first use of the computer password was used at MIT in the 1960s so that many people could use the same computer without all using the same account. Unsurprisingly, the first data breach happened in the 1960s too.  In 1965, William D. Matthews from MIT found a flaw in an IBM mainframe computer’s software and exploited the flaw to print all the users’ passwords.

Let’s start with the basics. What are passwords for? A password is simply the proof that you are the owner of the username you use when logging in to a system. Without the password, a username by itself will not grant access to an account. Passwords become even more important later, because we can also use a second password of sorts to get even more secure!

## What are credentials?

Credentials are the combination of a username and a password. The username is the identifier of your user account, such as an email address or customer number. The password is the *secret* part of your credentials. Some accounts let you create a special username, different from your email address, whereas others will require that you use your personal email address. In any case, the username was never intended to be a secret, but the password is.

## Why is one great password not enough?

It isn't farfetched to assume that some of your data has probably already been stolen or leaked. If you use the same password across more than one service or website, an attacker could easily reuse a stolen password to access more of your accounts and data.

However, if you use different passwords for each of your accounts, then if that password is stolen, only that account is in danger. Compare that with having to change every password for each of your accounts, if you used the same password for all your accounts.

But how do you remember a different password for every account? What if you have dozens or hundreds of accounts? How can you safely protect all those passwords? If you want to do it securely, there are a couple of good options:

- Write them all down on paper and store that paper in a safe, secured place, like a safe. How is this safe? Hackers usually can’t physically get to your safe and open it.
- Use a password manager. How is this safe? Password managers are designed to be very secure, with the key known only to the person that set it. They are also convenient, making them more likely to be used!

Since storing a notebook of passwords in a safe is not convenient, the password manager is the better option for almost everybody who uses a computer and/or smartphone. A password manager will be your safest option, if you treat it carefully. In this case, *carefully* means that you should: 

- Use a passphrase
- Use *multi-factor authentication* to secure it.

Don’t worry about the *multi-factor authentication* yet. It’s not nearly as complicated as it sounds, and we will go over that a little later in this training.

## What's even better than a password?

What is a passphrase and how is it different from a password?

In the past, the recommendation for a strong password was to use 8 characters, with at least one uppercase character, number, and a special character such as !, :, *, or #,. The problem with this guidance is that it resulted in passwords that were easy for a hacker to crack, and were hard for people to remember. So when someone had to create a password like that, they were more likely to come up with the simplest password possible that met those rules, and then probably reused it everywhere possible. Though a single, complex password conveniently works around to meet password requirements, using the same complex password in multiple places is far less secure than having different simple passwords for each of your accounts.

One famous example is the password *Pa$$w0rd*. In this example, you can meet all of the criteria, yet this password is very high on the list of the top 1,000 most commonly used passwords. Hackers also have access to large lists of the top 1,000,000 most commonly used passwords for making password cracking even easier for them. In case you think you have a password that is unguessable, you should know that tools exist that will use *brute force*, to try every combination of all characters in order to guess your passwords. Computers are good at guessing quickly, so be careful to not assume your password can never be guessed.

## Creating a secure and complex password/passphrase

What is better than any complicated, short password? A long, complicated password. Unfortunately, they tend to be difficult to type and that much more challenging to remember.

But there is another approach available that is easier to type and remember: a passphrase. A classic example is "correct horse battery staple", immortalized in the web comic [XKCD #936](https://xkcd.com/936/?azure-portal=true).

In this example, the four words are actually much harder for a computer to guess than a shorter, much more complicated-looking password. Comparatively, these words are clearly easier to remember than something long with complex characters.

Pick any four words from objects in the room around you and add a fifth word, anywhere in the middle, representing something unique to you. You have just created a fantastic passphrase! Take for example: *speaker card soda antenna sheetrock*. If you use that passphrase to secure your password manager, you will be very safe. Add another word, or some complex combination of characters, and you’ll be even better off.

Ok, you now have a great passphrase, and are ready to make sure all of your accounts have totally different, complicated passwords or passphrases. How can you conveniently keep track of them all, while still being secure?

## Password managers to the rescue!

In the past decade, *password managers* have been developed to make it easy for you to keep your accounts secure without having to memorize all your passwords. A password manager is a tool that securely locks up all of your passwords until you need them, similar to a safe. You then access your passwords by using your one easy-to-remember and hard-to-crack passphrase. Password managers also encrypt the data stored in them to ensure that if the files themselves were stolen, the data residing in them would be inaccessible without the passphrase.

The first step is to research and select a trusted password manager. These are the five most commonly used, convenient, and highly-rated password managers according to [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/best-password-managers/). They work in all browsers, on Windows, Mac OS, and most smartphones.

- Bitwarden
- NordPass
- Dashlane
- 1Password
- KeePassXC

To take any of these for a test run, simply download the app to your computer or smartphone, and give it a try. Some of these are available for free, with added features available to paid versions. As these are commonly available with browser extensions, make sure to install the extension for your browser to make using them even simpler.

## I’ve installed my password manager... What’s next?

At this point you should update your passwords to make sure they are complex, or are not being reused in multiple places. This is a great opportunity to change all your passwords, and tie your accounts to your password manager. Some password managers will generate complex passwords for you as you make changes in the accounts that need new passwords. Good password managers will also record the updates for you, so you won’t have to enter that information twice.

With your accounts and passwords now stored and secured, you'll be able to view and manage login information from just one place. Similarly, you can add and store other confidential information like addresses, credit card numbers, or your passport number. 

Luckily, most of the steps from here are automated. For example, when you visit a website or app, your login information for that site will automatically fill in. As long as you unlock your vault with the single passphrase, you can log into your other accounts automatically afterwards. If you are concerned about someone else being able to use your password manager if you step away from the computer, you can configure your password manager to automatically re-lock itself after a minute, or any time frame you would prefer.

When you're done using your online accounts, you can simply close or lock the password manager. This will make sure your passwords are unavailable to anyone else that you may share a computer with.

## More reasons to use a password manager

One of the best things about password managers is that you can have your data securely synchronized across multiple devices. For example, if you update a password on your laptop, it will also be updated in your phone app.

If you are worried about whether the data is stored securely, you should also know that the data stored in the password managers recommended earlier can’t be accessed by anyone without knowing your passphrase. The companies behind the recommended password managers do not know what your passphrase is, as part of the design for securing a password manager.

But wait, there’s more! Password managers can also allow you to share some passwords with family members, without having to share your passphrase. You can even and provide an emergency access option to a trusted family member for all of the secured information, should you want a backup plan.

Password managers are convenient, secure, simple to use, and will do most of the hard work for you. Of course, you will have to add your accounts, but that is an activity you only need to do once. After that, all you need to remember is your master passphrase to get into your vault of secure passwords.

## How your passwords get exposed

There are currently billions of username and password combinations for sale, but there are even billions more available for free. Where did they all come from? Previous breaches. There are thousands of breaches every year, and those breaches expose all kinds of personal data, along with account information including usernames and passwords.

What is a "breach" and why should you care? A breach is what happens when information that is supposed to be kept private gets exposed instead. In other words, your data gets leaked. This matters because that information can be used for many bad things: identity theft, blackmail, harassment, and other crimes. Even an account you may not care about, like an email account you don’t use any more, could be used by an attacker to pretend to be you. They can send email with malware to your contacts, or to sign up for other accounts with your name. This is just one of the many things that can be done with a stolen account.

You can go to [';--have i been pwned?](https://HaveIBeenPwned.com) and see if one or more of your accounts has been leaked in one of the thousands of tracked, public data breaches. You can even check any of your passwords to see if they have been exposed through a breach.

If you find that your information shows up here, don’t worry. Change the passwords for any identified accounts, and store your new account information in your password manager.
