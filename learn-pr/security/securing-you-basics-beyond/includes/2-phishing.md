Here is a common scenario: you are looking through your emails and you see something from one of your social media accounts. Everything looks official. It asks you to log in to your account and verify your contact information is correct. You click on the link in the email, and log into what looks like your account.

Unfortunately in that moment, an attacker has successfully stolen your account login information.

This email-based, *social engineering* technique is called *Phishing*. Attackers successfully use this technique very frequently, regularly sending [over billions of phishing emails every year.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/12/11/the-quiet-evolution-of-phishing/)

But there is good news: You can avoid it! Through the next sections, we'll learn more about phishing and how you can protect yourself to avoid becoming a victim.

## Introduction to phishing

Phishing emails are usually written in a way to convince you to do one of two things: 
1. Click a link and navigate to a dangerous webpage or…
1. Click on an attachment, which runs a dangerous program.

One of the most common phishing goals is to collect your personal information, such as your username and password. If the attacker is successful, the attacker will use your stolen information to access your account, along with other accounts, under the assumption you use the same password everywhere. 

Another common phishing goal is to deliver *malware*, a type of malicious software. Often included as an attachment, opening one of these bad attachments could result in running a program that could degrade/harm your computer, or even lock you out from it permanently. Of course, *social engineering* is leveraged again to make the attachment look harmless. You'll often see examples that are made to look like bank statements or pictures. 

One of the most infamous types of *malware* is the dreaded *ransomware*, capable of permanently locking you out of your computer, without the ability to recover any of your personal files.   

> [!TIP]
> If you are permanently locked out of your computer, and suspect it may be ransomware, there are rare cases where ransomware decryption keys are made available for free. These decryption keys allow you to unlock your computers and get your data back. You can get more information here: [NoMoreRansom.org](https://www.nomoreransom.org/). But this is no excuse to take a relaxed approach to phishing attachments. Most ransomware attacks will not be fixed with this option.

Here is a simple and entertaining example: [LICENSE INFO AS NEEDED]

Phishing is one of the most common threats on the internet, affecting everyone, regardless of their background. In 2019 alone, the [FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported over 450,000 complaints, recording more than $3.5 billion in losses to individuals and businesses.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2019-internet-crime-report-released-021120) This only represents a small number of the actual cases. In other words, it is very popular, and unfortunately a very successful way for a criminal to steal your data.

> Similar to phishing, tech support scams use *social engineering* to get you to provide your personal information, username and password, credit card details, etc.

## Why does phishing work so often?

Phishing is designed to be as believable as possible. Attackers have been using the same approach since the first phishing emails in the 90s. Much of the time, they try to take advantage of your good nature, your desire to help, or your desire to solve a problem.

Attackers know what emotions get people to respond. For example, they will send an email to get you to click a link quickly by telling you something needs to happen urgently. One common example is *Your account has been closed*.

Another common approach is to offer something too good to be true. The attacker will tell you that you’ve won an award or that they need you to manage their huge sums of money.

One other common approach that attackers will use is to take advantage of your curiosity, maybe by making a fake job offer, pretending to be an old friend, or asking for help for their fake nonprofit.

## What can you do to protect yourself?

First, recognize phishing! Here are some common features of phishing attacks that you should be on the lookout for:

- **Attachments** - If your email has an attachment that you don’t expect, it could be phishing, and that attachment could be dangerous.
- **Unusual hyperlinks** - Be aware of any links in emails. If you hover over a link and the destination looks odd, it could be a dangerous website. One click is all it takes to go to a bad website, get ransomware, or other malware installed on your computer or smartphone.
- **Urgency** - If something says you need to do something *right now*, it could be a phishing email. Remember, your bank usually doesn’t reach out to you with no warning using an email subject of *We are cancelling all of your accounts!*
- **Bad spelling or grammar** - Phishing emails are often full of unusual writing, spelling, and grammar errors. If the email looks suspicious, you should avoid interacting with it.
- **Fake sender** - If the email address looks unusual or is someone you don’t recognize, best to treat it as a phishing email.

In the image below, you can see an example of an email with all of these red flags.

Now that you recognize phishing email, let’s talk about the second way to protect yourself. It’s easy. Don’t do anything! That’s right. If you don’t click any links and don’t open any attachments in a phishing email, you should be safe.

If you aren’t quite sure about an email from a friend or family member, you still don’t need to click any links or open any attachments. You can give them a call or send a text message and ask if they sent you anything.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to do everyone a favor, please use the *report phishing* feature that may be present in your email app or website. This will notify the email provider to the phishing email addresses used, and permanently add them to a spam list if identified as phishing. You'll not only be protecting yourself, but everyone else that uses email.

You don’t have to be afraid of all your email, but you do need to pay close attention to unusual email. If you notice any phishing characteristics, just remember to not do anything with that email, other than reporting it.

Pay attention to your gut. If you can recognize signs of phishing, you’ll be safer!
