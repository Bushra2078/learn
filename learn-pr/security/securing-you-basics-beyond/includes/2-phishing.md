Imagine you are looking through your email and you see what looks like an alert from one of your social media accounts. Everything looks official. It asks you to log in to your account and verify your contact information is correct. You click the link in the email and log into what looks like your account.

Unfortunately, in that moment, an attacker has successfully stolen your account login information.

This email-based, *social engineering* technique is called *phishing*. Attackers use this technique frequently, sending [over a billion phishing emails every year.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/10/17/how-office-365-learned-to-reel-in-phish/?azure-portal=true)

There are ways to identify and protect yourself from phishing. Let's take a closer look at phishing and how you can protect yourself to avoid becoming a victim.

## What is phishing?

Phishing email is written to convince you to do one of two things:

- Click a link and navigate to a dangerous webpage.
- Open an attachment that runs a dangerous program.

> [!NOTE]
> In this training, the term *clicking a link* is used to represent clicking a link with a mouse, tapping a link on a phone, or using any other type of assistive or other device to activate a link.

One of the most common phishing goals is to collect your personal information, such as your username and password. If the attacker is successful, they will use your stolen information to access your account, and in some cases, any other accounts you use that same username and password for.

Another common phishing goal is to deliver malicious software, called *malware*. Opening one of these dangerous attachments could result in running a program that could harm your computer, or even lock you out of it, unless you pay a ransom. This malware is known as *ransomware*.

Phishing is one of the most common threats on the internet. In 2019 alone, the [FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported over 450,000 complaints, recording more than $3.5 billion in losses to individuals and businesses.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2019-internet-crime-report-released-021120?azure-portal=true) This only represents a small number of the actual cases. In other words, it is a popular and successful way for a criminal to steal your data.

## Why does phishing work so often?

Phishing is designed to be as believable as possible. Attackers have been using the same approach since the first phishing emails were sent in the 1990s. Much of the time, they try to take advantage of your good nature, your desire to help, or your desire to solve a problem.

Attackers know what emotions get people to respond. For example, they will send an email to get you to click a link by telling you something needs to happen urgently. One common example is an email that says your account has been closed. While this might seem like something serious at first, remember that most businesses won't send you an email saying that they've closed your account with no warning.

Another common approach is to offer something too good to be true. The attacker will tell you that you’ve won an award or that they need you to manage their large sums of money.

One other common approach that attackers will use is to take advantage of your curiosity. For example, they may make a fake job offer, pretend to be an old friend, or ask for help for their fake nonprofit.

## What can you do to protect yourself?

First, recognize phishing! The following video has some guidance on what to look for, and how to handle a possible phishing email. Let's take a look.

Here are some common features of phishing attacks that you should be on the lookout for:

- **Attachments**: If your email has an attachment that you don’t expect, it could be phishing, and that attachment could be dangerous.
- **Unusual hyperlinks**: Be aware of any links in emails. If you hover over a link and the destination looks odd, it could be a dangerous website. One click is all it takes to go to a website that looks just like a legitimate one, designed to capture your login information or even run malware.
- **Urgency**: If something says you need to do something *right now*, it could be a phishing email. Remember, your bank usually doesn’t reach out to you with no warning using an email subject of *We are canceling all of your accounts!*
- **Bad spelling or grammar**: Phishing emails are often full of unusual writing, spelling, and grammar errors. If the email looks suspicious, you should avoid interacting with it.
- **Fake sender**: If the email address looks unusual or is someone you don’t recognize, you should treat it as a phishing email.

In the image below, you can see an example of an email with all of these red flags.

Now that you can recognize phishing email and know to not click any links or open any attachments, let’s talk about what else you can do. Your email application or website probably has the *report phishing* feature. Using this feature will notify the email provider and help prevent similar email in the future. And, of course, you can delete the phishing email too.

If you aren’t sure about an email from a friend or family member, you still don’t need to click any links or open any attachments. You can give them a call or send a text message and ask if they sent you anything.

You don’t have to be worried of all your email, but you do need to pay close attention to anything that looks unusual or suspicious. If you notice any signs of phishing, just remember to not do anything with that email other than reporting it and deleting it.
