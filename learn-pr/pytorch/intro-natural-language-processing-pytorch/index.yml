title: Introduction to Natural Language Processing with PyTorch
summary: In this module, we will explore different neural network architectures for dealing with natural language texts. In the recent years, **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) has experiences fast growth as a field, primarily because performance of the language models depend on their overall ability to "understand" text, and that can be trained in unsupervised manner on large text corpora. Thus, pre-trained text models such as BERT simplified many NLP tasks, and dramatically improved the performance.
