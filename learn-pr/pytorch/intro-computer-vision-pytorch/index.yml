title: Introduction to Computer Vision with PyTorch 
summary:   In this module, you will get an introduction to Computer Vision using one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, PyTorch! We'll focus on the image classification task to learn how neural networks can be used to classify handwritten digits, see how convolutional neural networks work and how they improve image classification, and then learn to use pre-trained networks and transfer learning to train models that can solve real-world problems, such as cats vs. dogs classification on real photographs.
