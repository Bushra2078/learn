  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "How do the number of parameters in a convolutional layer and dense layer correlate?"
      choices:
        - content: "A convolutional layer contains more parameters"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A convolutional layer contains small filters that have the same weights for the whole image"
        - content: "A convolutional layer contains less parameters"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, a convolutional layer contains small filters that have the same weights for the whole image"
    - content: "If the size of an input image is **3x320x200**, what would be the size of the tensor after applying a 5x5 convolutional layer with 16 filters?"
      choices:
        - content: "16x316x196"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This is correct"
        - content: "3x316x196"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "First dimension should correspond to the number of filters"
        - content: "16x3x320x200"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Color dimension goes away after applying filters. Also, do not forget that sliding window reduces the spatial dimension."
        - content: "48x320x200"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Color dimension goes away after applying filters. Also, do not forget that sliding window reduces the spatial dimension."
        - content: "The size of input image is 3x320x200, what would be the size of the tensor after applying 5x5 convolutional layer with 16 filters?"
          isCorrect: false
    - content: "Which layers do we apply to significantly reduce spatial dimension in multi-layered CNN?"
      choices:
        - content: "Convolution"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolution layer only slightly reduces the dimension of the image"
        - content: "Flatten"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Flatten is used to reshape spatial tensor into a linear vector"
        - content: "MaxPooling"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Pooling layers (such as MaxPooling or AveragePooling) are used to decrease the dimension, usually by a factor of 2"
    - content: "Which layer is used between convolutional base of the network and final linear classifier?"
      choices:
        - content: "Convolution"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolution layers are used in convolutional base"
        - content: "Flatten"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Flatten is used to reshape spatial tensor into a linear vector"
        - content: "MaxPooling"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Pooling layers are often used to reduce the dimension in between convolutional layers"
        - content: "Sigmoid"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Sigmoid is usually used after the final layer to get the probability output"
