In this module, we will learn how to perform different computer vision tasks using [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org), one of the most popular Python libraries for building neural networks. 

We'll start with an introduction to small Dense Neural Networks (DNNs), then build on that knowledge to dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Lastly, look at how we can use pre-trained models in transfer learning to improve our results with smaller data sets.
