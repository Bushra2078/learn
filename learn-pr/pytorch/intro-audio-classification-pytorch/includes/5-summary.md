Congratulations on building an audio binary classification speech model!  

You now have a better understanding of how an analog audio turns to digital sound, and how to create spectrogram images of your wave files. You used the PyTorch Speech Commands dataset, parsed the classes down to `yes` and `no`, and then looked at ways to understand and visualize audio data patterns. From there, you took the spectrograms, created images, and used a convolutional neural network to build your model.

You can expand on this knowledge by looking at other datasets and sounds, the `MFCC` transformer, and then building your model.
