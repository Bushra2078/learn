In this module we introduced the key concepts to building machine learning models and implemented those concepts with PyTorch. We built a Computer Vision model that could classify images of T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boots. Now that you learned some of the basics of machine learning concepts, keep working through the Microsoft Learn content to learn more about building different types of machine learning models with PyTorch.
