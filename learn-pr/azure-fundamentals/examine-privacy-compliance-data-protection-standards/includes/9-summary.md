In this module, you learned about Microsoft's approach to privacy, security, and compliance. You explored resources specific to online services, including Azure, and how governments can use Azure to meet their specific security and compliance needs.

The security team at Tailwind Traders now has a better understanding of what resources are available to help it protect its data in the cloud and stay compliant:

 -  The [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement?azure-portal=true) provides trust in how Microsoft collects, protects, and uses customer data.
 -  The [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter?azure-portal=true) provides you with documentation about compliance standards and how Azure can support your business.
 -  The [Azure compliance documentation](/azure/compliance/?azure-portal=true) includes detailed information about legal and regulatory standards and compliance on Azure.

Keep in mind that compliance status for Azure products and services doesn't automatically translate to compliance for the service or application you build or host on Azure. You're responsible for ensuring that you achieve compliance with the legal and regulatory standards that you must follow.

Most services are the same on both Azure Government and global Azure. But there are some differences that you should be aware of. To learn more, [compare Azure Government and global Azure](/azure/azure-government/compare-azure-government-global-azure?azure-portal=true).
