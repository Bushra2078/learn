Traditionally, protecting access to systems and data involved the on-premises network perimeter and physical access controls. 

With people increasingly being able to work from anywhere, the rise of bring your own device (BYOD) strategies, mobile applications, and cloud applications, many of those access points are now outside of the company's physical networks.

_Identity_ has become the new primary security boundary. Accurately proving that someone is a valid user of your system, with an appropriate level of access, is critical to maintaining control of your data. This identity layer is now more often the target of attack than the network.

## Meet Tailwind Traders

## How will Tailwind Traders secure access to their cloud applications?

Tailwind Traders' mobile workforce is increasing, as are the number of applications Tailwind Traders runs in the cloud.

Retail employees located around the world are issued tablet devices from which they can create custom orders for customers, track delivery schedules, and plan their work schedules.

Delivery drivers are permitted to use their own mobile devices to access scheduling and logistics applications. Some delivery drivers are permanent employees of Tailwind Traders; others work on short-term contract.

Tailwind Traders uses Active Directory to secure their on-premises environments. They need to ensure that only employees can sign in and access their business applications. Tailwind Traders also needs to ensure that short-term staff can access these applications only when they're under active contract.

How can Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) help Tailwind Traders consistently secure all of their applications, both when accessed from their intranet and from public networks?

## Learning objectives
