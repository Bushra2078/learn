In this module, we wanted to help Tailwind Traders choose the right serverless computing technology for their business scenarios.  When they needed to build a solution that pulled code logic from an existing C# Windows Service, we helped them choose Azure Functions.  When they needed to orchestrate a workflow to improve customer retention after a negative shopping experience, we helped them choose Azure Logic Apps.  In both of these cases, we noted how it would be possible to choose the other serverless computing service, however we tried to help them consider the decision criteria we outlined and choose the right service for the scenario.

Without serverless computing, Tailwind Traders would be forced to set up and manage their own computing infrastructure for these business scenarios.  They would have needed to closely monitor the services to determine if they needed to scale the service, and would have likely wasted money in the process with either too much or too little computing resources dedicated to their solution.  Additionally, we may have had to design, write, test, and maintain custom code to get similar results.

By helping Tailwind Traders select the right serverless computing solutions, they were able to deploy new functionality that improved customer satisfaction with their ecommerce platform.
