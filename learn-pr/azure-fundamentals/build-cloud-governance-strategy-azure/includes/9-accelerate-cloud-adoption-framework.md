The [Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) provides you with proven guidance to help with your cloud adoption journey. The Cloud Adoption Framework helps you create and implement the business and technology strategies needed to succeed in the cloud.

Tailwind Traders needs to control its cloud environment so that it complies with several industry standards, but it's not sure where to start. It has existing business requirements, and it understands how these requirements relate to its on-premises workloads. These requirements also must be met by any workloads it runs in the cloud.

You've been tasked with investigating what's available on Azure and to define and implement the governance strategy for Tailwind Traders. You decide to start with the Cloud Adoption Framework.

## What's in the Cloud Adoption Framework?

As mentioned in the video, Cloud Adoption Framework consists of tools, documentation, and proven practices. The Cloud Adoption Framework includes these stages:

1.  Define your strategy.
2.  Make a plan.
3.  Ready your organization.
4.  Adopt the cloud.
5.  Govern and manage your cloud environments.

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-framework-stages-9b54ccbe.png" alt-text="A flow diagram showing the Cloud Adoption Framework stages define strategy, plan, ready, adopt, and govern and manage.":::


The govern stage focuses on cloud governance. You can refer back to the Cloud Adoption Framework for recommended guidance as you build your cloud governance strategy.

To help build your adoption strategy, the Cloud Adoption Framework breaks out each stage into further exercises and steps. Let's take a brief look at each stage.

### Define your strategy

Here, you answer why you're moving to the cloud and what you want to get out of cloud migration. Do you need to scale to meet demand or reach new markets? Will it reduce costs or increase business agility? When you define your cloud business strategy, you should understand [cloud economics](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/cloud-economics?azure-portal=true) and consider business impact, turnaround time, global reach, performance, and more.

Here are the steps in this stage.
