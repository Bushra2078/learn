      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The `docker images` command returns a list of the images available on your container host, which are images that have already been pulled down."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The `docker commit` command commits to a new container image all the changes you made to a container."
