Creating accessible content helps users to better understand and interact with your content. Microsoft 365 provides built-in accessibility features and tools to ensure everyone can create accessible content. In this module, we explore how to utilize these applications to create accessible headings/titles, images, color, and multimedia. Youâ€™ll learn how to use the Microsoft 365 Accessibility Checker and Accessibility Assistant to get help creating and editing documents, presentations, emails, and websites that are accessible to people with disabilities.
