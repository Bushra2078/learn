"Support through multiple ways" is another important foundational accessibility concept. Providing players with multiple ways to complete a single task can support player success for a host of different game scenarios and experiences. 

In this unit, you'll be introduced to accessibility best practice principles derived from the concept of "multiple ways of task completion."

## Providing multiple ways to navigate menus

Complex menu trees can commonly introduce inaccessible experiences for players. Navigating through nested menus to locate a specific setting can be very cognitive and physically demanding for some players with cognitive, visual, or physical disabilities. The following approaches provide players with multiple paths to locate desired settings within a menu.

### Accelerator prompts

One way to provide an alternate means of navigating through menu trees is on-screen shortcuts or accelerator prompts. For example, the following image from the Forza Horizon 4 launch screen provides players with a prompt to press the “X” button to open the settings menu. This option allows players to bypass the traditional launch flow and immediately open the accessibility settings menu if needed.

### Quick settings

Flexibility for menu navigation can also be supported at the platform level. For example, the following image of the Xbox Platform’s Quick Settings menu allows players to quickly toggle accessibility settings on or off. This menu can be easily opened through a two-step process; pressing the guide button, then pressing the view button. Players can adjust accessibility settings without having to close the game or application they currently have open.

## Providing multiple ways to complete objectives

Game objectives may require a series of actions to be completed in a specific order. Consider creating alternative paths to help ensure that players with disabilities can still achieve objective completion.

Stardew Valley is an example of a game that allows players to complete collectible item-based tasks through multiple approaches:

- Providing players with multiple ways to complete collectible item tasks. For example, in the following image, a player is viewing the “Missing Bundle” task. The game lists six potential item options that can be collected to complete this task. However, players only need to collect five of the six items for task completion. Therefore, if one of them items is too challenging to collect, they can bypass collecting that item specifically and still complete the same task.

- Additionally, the game provides multiple ways in which these items can be found. While players can traditionally acquire collectible items by farming them, fishing for them, or defeating enemies, they can also purchase some of the items at various locations in the game.  

## Providing multiple ways of engaging in combat

The complexity and speed of in-game combat situations can introduce inaccessible experiences for various players. When games provide multiple ways to defeat enemies, players can approach combat-related tasks in ways that align with their needs and preferences, and still be successful.

### Long-range weapon options

Some players may find close combat scenarios inaccessible. These situations often require players to rapidly press controls to generate short-range attacks like punches or swinging a sword. When games provide alternate ways to inflict enemy damage, such as long-range weapons, players can slowly defeat enemies from afar.

For example, in the following image from the game Minecraft Dungeons, players can defeat enemies face-to-face with their melee weapon. They can also choose to level up their long-range weapons like arrows and explosives to defeat enemies from afar, taking breaks when needed.

## Providing multiple ways of meeting input demands

Completing any game task first requires some form of input from the player. Meeting input demands can be challenging from both a hardware and software perspective. Consider providing players with "multiple ways" of meeting these input demands.

### Quick time events (QTEs)

Game events that require a player to rapidly press a specific combination of buttons, or select specific areas on their screen, can introduce barriers to access. These types of events place high demands on a player’s hand-eye coordination, visual acuity, finger dexterity, cognitive processing, and more.

Consider providing players with multiple ways to complete quick time events. Alternative options that are less physically demanding include settings to reduce input demands to a single button or the ability to bypass quick time events altogether.

For example, in the following screen capture from the Assassin's Creed Valhalla game, players can choose between one-time press, hold, or repeated presses for quick time events. Another option has been added to bypass QTEs entirely in some boss encounters.

### Input device support

In addition to software features and settings, supporting multiple types of input devices for a single game or platform also works to support accessible experiences for more players.

Game experiences may traditionally rely on input devices that are specific to the type of platform on which the experience is running. Consider the following examples:

- Mobile games are designed to optimize touch-screen input.
- Console games are optimized to support game controllers.
- PC games generally optimize for a mouse and keyboard.
- Virtual Reality experiences can be heavily motion-based.

Imagine a scenario where a developer only supports keyboard and mouse input for their PC game. A player with a fine motor disability who can't access keyboard and mouse input would be excluded from playing that game. If this game were to support multiple input types, including controllers and game pads, this player would then be able to use their assistive technology inputs through a device like their Xbox Adaptive Controller.
