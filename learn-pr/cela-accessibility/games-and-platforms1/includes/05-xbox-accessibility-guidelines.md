You're now familiar with some of the foundational accessibility best practice concepts that can be broadly applied across gaming experiences. With a broadened understanding of these general concepts, more detailed guidance is likely needed.

For example, you know that the best practice principle of "customization" means providing players with options to adjust the size and color of text. However, questions regarding the extent of size and color options you should provide are still unclear in the context of your specific game. This is where detailed resources on accessibility best practices such as the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines (XAGs) can be a valuable tool.

This unit provides an overview of the content within the XAGs, and general instructions on how to navigate this resource to find guidance related to the products and experiences you create.

## What are the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines?

The [Xbox Accessibility Guidelines](https://aka.ms/xags) are a set of game accessibility best practices that have been developed in partnership with industry experts and members of the Gaming & Disability Community. They were initially released by Microsoft in January 2020.

These guidelines are intended for the following audiences and use cases:

 - For designers as a catalyst for generating ideas
 - For developers as guardrails when they develop their games
 - For test teams as a checklist to validate the accessibility of their titles

> [!NOTE]
> The XAGs aren't intended to function as a checklist to validate any type of compliance or legal requirements. Instead, they seek to ensure that the user experience in a game offers a base level of accessible support that makes games enjoyable and playable for as many players as possible.

The guidelines are separated into 23 individual sections, or XAGs, that focus on specific aspects of inclusive game design. These topics include best practices for the following sections:

The XAGs are updated about every six months. Before the update, feedback from developers and gamers is incorporated into existing XAGs or used to inform the creation of new XAGs.

## How can developers use the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines?

To make the best use of the guidance provided in the XAGs, it's important to understand individual XAG components and how they can be used to help you go through the document.

The following video introduces each XAG component and describes how developers can use the components to guide accessibility best practice implementation.
