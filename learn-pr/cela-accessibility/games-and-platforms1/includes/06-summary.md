In this module, you’ve learned about foundational accessibility best practice principles for games and platforms. You’ve also been introduced to the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines (XAGs) as a comprehensive resource to guide accessible game development.

Let’s recap some of the key learnings presented:

- A general understanding of foundational accessibility concepts that can be broadly applied to game development is an important first step in making best practice implementation more approachable for developers.
- These foundational concepts include the notion of customization, representation through multiple channels, and multiple ways of task completion.
- The Xbox Accessibility Guidelines can be used as a reference for targeted guidance on specific game areas. Each XAG topic provides a detailed description of the players impacted, which individual game areas to apply best practices, implementation guidelines, and other resources and tools to promote clarity and comprehension.
