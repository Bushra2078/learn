Determining a starting point when it comes to best practice implementation can prove difficult. An understanding of the foundational accessibility concepts that many specific best practice guidelines are based on can help make this process more approachable.

One of those foundational concepts revolves around providing customizable experiences. When customization options are provided across all aspects of a game experience, more players can enjoy the same game in a way that's optimized for their specific needs and preferences. Regardless of the general game mechanic, element, or component, the concept of customization applies throughout.

In this unit, you’ll be introduced to some game and platform examples where the concept of customizable experiences is broadly implemented across the following areas:

- Visual Settings
- Audio Settings
- Game Difficulty Settings
- Notification and Visual Distraction Settings
- Input Controls and Mapping
- Additional Mechanics and Game Elements

## Customization of visual elements

Players should be able to customize visual aspects of their interface including the size, color, style, and placement of elements. This allows players to create a visual experience that supports their individual needs and preferences. Examples of visual elements that commonly benefit from player customization include the following areas.

### Text-based visual elements

Allow players to customize text displayed in menus, chat boxes, captions and subtitles, and other areas where text is present. Specifically, you can provide text customization options like:

- Text Size: Provide an option for players to customize the size of text. This is shown in the following image of the Gears 5 accessibility settings menu. Players can adjust the text size for menu and subtitle text.

:::image type="content" source="../media/subtitle-size.png" alt-text="The options screen from Gears 5 is displayed. Subtitle Size is highlighted and is set to large.":::

- Text Color: Provide players the ability to choose the color of text and its background. For example, the following image of the Xbox Platform captioning settings shows the provided customization options for font color, background color, and window color of subtitle text.

:::image type="content" source="../media/caption-background-color.png" alt-text="The captioning screen on Xbox. The Background Color option is selected and set to Blue.":::

- Font Style: Provide font type customization settings. For example, in the following screen capture from the Xbox Platform caption settings, players can choose between eight different font style options including serif and sans serif choices.

### Heads-up display elements

Allow players to customize the size and position of their heads-up display. For example, the following image from Minecraft Dungeons, a comparison between the heads-up display scaled to 70%, versus the heads-up display scaled to 150% is displayed.

:::image type="content" source="../media/hud-size.png" alt-text="Two sets of screenshots from Minecraft Dungeons. They demonstrate how the Hud Scale setting can be set between 70% to 150%.":::

### Visual elements within the game environment

Allow players to customize any relevant visual elements that inform gameplay. Examples of in-game visual element customization can include:

- Enemy outline color: Allow players to customize the colors and appearance of indicators like enemy color rings. Players can choose colors that they find easiest to see. For example, in the following image of the accessibility menu from Minecraft Dungeons, players can choose the enemy outline color from a wide range of color options.

:::image type="content" source="../media/enemy-outline-color.png" alt-text="The accessibility menu in Minecraft Dungeons. Enemy Outline Color is selected and the color is set to pink.":::

- Visual Assists: Allow players to enable and disable other visual indicators that inform game play like the presence of outlines around objects and enemies. For example, in the following image of the settings menu from the Outer Worlds, players can turn on outlines that appear around objects that can be interacted with.

:::image type="content" source="../media/interaction-outlines.png" alt-text="The UI settings in the game The Outer Worlds. The Interaction Outlines checkbox is selected and checked.":::

## Customization of audio settings

Audio output is another major area where customization options are important in adhering to best practice guidelines. Some examples of audio customization options can include:

### Volume customization

Allow players to customize the volume of each audio channel separately from one another. For example, in the following image of the Grounded audio settings menu, players can adjust the Master Volume, Effects Volume, Music Volume, UI Volume, Dialogue Volume, and Voice Chat Volume individually.

:::image type="content" source="../media/audio.png" alt-text="The audio options menu in Grounded. The player is given sliders to control the master, effects, music, UI, dialogue, and voice chat volume.":::

### Audio channel customization

Allow players to customize aspects of their audio channel output. For example, the following image of the Xbox Platform’s Accessibility Audio settings allows players to turn on mono output to combine all audio channels into one. This supports players with asymmetrical hearing loss who may miss certain spatial audio cues depending on their location.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mono-audio.png" alt-text="The audio accessibility menu on the Xbox. The Mono Output setting is highlighted and unchecked.":::

## Customization of game difficulty

Allow players to customize the difficulty of the game. Providing customization options for both overall difficulty and individual game mechanic difficulty are equally important. Examples of these two types of customization include the following areas.

### Overall game difficulty

By providing players the ability to adjust overall game difficulty, you can support players who prefer to minimize challenge and enjoy the storyline. For example, in the following image of the Outer Worlds “Select Difficulty” menu, players can choose between Story, Normal, Hard, and Supernova. Each difficulty level provides a detailed description of what players can expect in terms of enemy health, damage, and other aspects of gameplay that contribute to difficulty.

:::image type="content" source="../media/difficulty.png" alt-text="The difficulty settings screen in The Outer Worlds. Story is selected with a description of how it impacts gameplay. It reads, Use this mode if you enjoy story more than combat. In Store Mode, enemies have less health and do less damage.":::

### Difficulty of individual mechanics and components

Individual game mechanics can also influence overall difficulty. In addition to overall game difficulty customization, players should be able to customize individual game mechanics that contribute to overall difficulty. This supports players who generally prefer a certain difficulty level, but are blocked by a very specific mechanic or factor.

The game Don't Starve, for example, is a survival game that imposes challenges related to gathering food and resources, protecting one's character from dangerous weather, and staying safe from enemies. In the following image of the Don’t Starve Together World Generation customization menu, players can customize the amount of available food and resources, the presence of each individual enemy in the game, and the length and duration of each weather "season." This allows players to eliminate or lessen enemies so they can focus on gathering resources, or any combination of supports and challenges they prefer.

:::image type="content" source="../media/dont-starve-difficulty.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Custom presets menu in Don't Starve Together. The Forest tab is selected.":::

## Customization of notifications and visual distractions

Allow players to customize aspects of the experience that may cause distraction. Distractions can include notifications or popups at the game or platform level, animated content, and more. Customizing an experience to eliminate distractions irrelevant to the players current focus can create a more accessible experience. Examples of these types of customization include the following areas:

### Notification customization

Allow players to customize the amount of time and location in which notifications are shown. For example, in the images below of the Xbox Preferences Settings for Notifications, players can choose which types of notifications they’d like to receive on-screen alerts for, how long those alerts will remain on their screen, and the area of the screen they will appear.

:::image type="content" source="../media/platform-notification-timing.png" alt-text="The notification timing preferences screen on Xbox. Choose how long your banner notification pops up for is highlighted and 30 seconds is selected.":::

:::image type="content" source="../media/notification-placement-bottom-right.png" alt-text="The notifications preferences screen on Xbox. A 3x3 grid is displayed on the right side of the screen and the lower-right box is highlighted with a check in it.":::

### Animated content

Allow players to customize on-screen content that is moving, blinking, scrolling, or otherwise animated. This is important during game experiences where players are required to read text on screen but can become distracted or disoriented by background movement. For example, in the following video capture of from the Forza Horizon 5 accessibility settings menu, players can enable and disable background movement while they navigate their menu settings.

## Customization of additional elements and mechanics

The principle of customization should be applied throughout as many aspects of the game and platform experience as possible. There are many areas beyond the initial visual, audio, difficulty, and auto-playing content covered in this unit that would benefit from customization options. Be sure to consider all aspects of the experience you are developing.
