Assistive technologies are products or tools commonly used by individuals with disabilities to help them complete daily tasks. In the context of gaming, common assistive technologies can include software like screen narration programs, magnification tools, closed captioning, and more. Also, players may use hardware-based assistive technologies like adaptive keyboards, mice, controllers, and other specialized input devices.

While accessibility should ideally be embedded into your work, it is still important to ensure that players can use the assistive technologies they already own while gaming.

Imagine a player who is blind. They use screen narration software on their PC that reads text and visual elements aloud, which helps them complete school assignments. They recently heard about a new PC game that can be played through audio cues alone, an incredibly important game feature for players who are blind. They purchase and start up the game, but the screen narration software on their PC is not compatible with it. The player knows they launched the game app but does not know what the contents of the initial game launch screen are because these elements are not being narrated aloud.

Although the game itself could be partially accessible for this player because in-game play can be fully navigated via audio cues alone, they are still blocked from this experience because they cannot navigate the main menu to locate the start button without screen narration. If the platform or title had ensured that their products were compatible with third-party screen narration software, or provided game title or platform-level screen narration software, then this player might have been able to navigate to the in-game play.

In this module, you will be introduced to common hardware and software assistive technologies that players with disabilities may use to improve access to gaming experiences. You will learn about the impact of assistive technologies on player experiences, the importance of supporting assistive technology compatibility within your title, platform, or hardware device.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe common hardware and software assistive technologies that players with disabilities may use while gaming and apply these learnings within the context of game title, platform, and hardware development to best support individual player needs as they relate to assistive technology access while gaming.
