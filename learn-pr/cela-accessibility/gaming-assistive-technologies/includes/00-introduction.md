Assistive technologies (AT) are products or tools used by individuals with disabilities to perform daily tasks. Devices like wheelchairs, prosthetics, hearing aids, adaptive eating utensils, and more are considered AT. AT products are also commonly used to access technology. 

In gaming, players with disabilities may use hardware and software-based technologies to support accessible experiences. Common examples include screen readers, magnification tools, and adaptive input devices.

Consider the following scenario: a player with low vision uses a high contrast setting on their PC to enhance the readability of text. When they launch a new game title, however, many of the elements in the game title's UI are missing or obscured. It's apparent that the game is displaying incorrectly due to incompatibility;s with the player's platform-level high contrast settings.

This player requires a high contrast display for play. They search the game title's menu but cannot find an in-game high contrast setting. Disappointed in their recent purchase going to waste, the player abandon's the game. They know they won't be able to play it without compatible AT to support their visual needs. As a developer, you hear about this experience and are hoping to learn more about the AT that players with disabilities use to ensure that the future products and experiences support accessible AT experiences. 

In this module, you'll be introduced to common hardware and software assistive technologies that players with disabilities may use to improve access to gaming experiences. You will learn about the impact of assistive technologies on player experiences, the importance of supporting assistive technology compatibility within your title, platform, or hardware device.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

 - Describe common hardware-based gaming assistive technologies and how their use can impact player experiences.  
 - Describe common gaming software-based features and tools and how their use can impact player experiences. 
 - Determine appropriate methods to support assistive technology users when developing games and platforms.
