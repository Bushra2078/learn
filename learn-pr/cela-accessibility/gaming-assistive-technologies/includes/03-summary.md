In this module, you've learned about common hardware and software technologies that players with disabilities may use while gaming. Let's take a look at some of the things we've covered:

What assistive technologies do players with disabilities commonly use and why is it important to provide access to these assistive technologies in your game titles, platforms, and hardware devices?

- Common hardware assistive technologies used in gaming include adaptive controllers, mouth-based inputs, switch buttons, adaptive joysticks, adaptive mice, adaptive keyboards, eye control devices, hearing aids, and cochlear implants.
- Common software assistive technologies used in gaming include screen narration tools, high contrast settings, magnification tools, captioning, software remapping, and player-to-player communication tools.
- When these assistive technologies are provided, players with disabilities who require these resources to access gaming experiences are less likely to be excluded.
