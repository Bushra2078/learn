In gaming, assistive hardware devices often consist of accessible versions of inputs like controllers, mice, and keyboards. These devices may come in sizes or form factors that differ from traditional input devices to provide players with disabilities access points that work for their individual levels of strength, dexterity, range of motion, and more. Other hardware assistive technologies that are important to be aware of in the context of gaming include devices like hearing aids and cochlear implants. This unit will introduce some common hardware assistive technologies that are helpful to be aware of if you are interested in game accessibility.

### Adaptive hardware gaming inputs

Adaptive or accessible controllers usually refer to custom input devices that are designed to provide access to all inputs needed to play a game for a specific player's needs.

### Switch Access

Switches are essentially buttons of varying sizes that players may use if they are unable to access the buttons on standard input devices like controllers, keyboard keys, or left and right click on a mouse due their size, layout, or amount of force required to press the button down.

- Switches:
  - Different sizes
  - Different activation forces required
  - Keep note of mounting points
  - Head
  - Leg
  - Feet
  - Large sizes
  - Bite switches

### Adaptive joysticks

Joysticks that vary in size, tension, and access may also be used by players with disabilities who have difficulty accessing the thumb sticks on a standard controller or using a mouse.

- Joysticks:
  - Ultrastik
  - U shaped handle
  - One-handed joysticks (don't add PDP)
  - WFE
  - quadstick
  - Mindful of players whose hands are tied up with FPS double sticks and cant access buttons as readily

### The Xbox Adaptive Controller

One common hardware device used in the gaming accessibility space is the Xbox Adaptive Controller. The Xbox Adaptive Controller essentially functions as a hub for transmitting inputs from adaptive devices to Xbox consoles, mobile devices running iOS, and PC platforms running Windows 10. Players can choose from the various types of buttons, joysticks, and more that meet their access needs, plug them into the XAC, then connect their XAC to the console, PC, or mobile device. Many of the individual buttons and joysticks can be plugged directly into the Xbox Adaptive Controller to be used on the platforms compatible with the controller.

### Hearing aids and cochlear implants

Players may also use hearing devices like hearing aids or cochlear implants. These players may be unable to use headphones while gaming. Wearing over-the-ear headphones with these devices may cause discomfort for players, especially if contact between the hearing aid and headphone is made, resulting in unwanted feedback noises. Additionally, players with certain kinds of hearing devices that sit inside of the ear may be unable to use in-ear headphones due to lack of space.

Some hearing aids and cochlear implants can be connected to phones, tablets, and other technologies via Bluetooth. This can enable players who use hearing devices an ability to have sound output from their device channeled directly into their hearing device, avoiding the need to use headphones. Platform and hardware developers may consider supporting the ability to wirelessly pair hearing devices to a game controller, console, or other platform for these players. Additionally, hardware developers working on gaming headsets should consider including users with hearing aids and cochlear implants throughout the product development process to create headsets that can be worn by these players without causing interference.

### Hardware considerations for gaming accessibility

Whether you are a current or aspiring game title developer, platform developer, or hardware developer, it's important to be aware of the common hardware assistive technologies players may be using. Some key points to consider regarding these technologies include the following:

- An understanding of how users interact with their input devices can provide important context around the software-based accessibility features or settings your game or platform can provide, and why they are important. Players with limited mobility in their hands and fingers may be using other body parts to activate buttons. When quick-time events in a game are optimized for players who are swiftly moving their fingers to mash buttons, players using body parts like their head, knee, elbow, foot, etc. may not be able to move their larger body parts as quickly or easily as their thumbs. Understanding how input demands for the same exact game level can more difficult for players who are gaming in their own adaptive ways can be helpful when assessing your game titles accessibility barriers and scoping potential solutions.
- This awareness is valuable for documenting input compatibility between various types of hardware devices and your game title or platform. Players may be unable to use a standard controller but may be able to access a mouse and keyboard for game inputs. They would like to know whether a game supports mouse and keyboard input before purchasing a game title. Similarly, devices like the Xbox Adaptive Controller only support adaptive hardware devices connected via USB if they emit HID joystick or HID gamepad outputs. Therefore, a keyboard that uses HID keyboard, would not work when plugged into the Xbox Adaptive Controller. Providing clear documentation on the types of devices your game title, platform, or hardware devices support can help players make informed purchases when choosing new gaming products if they know they have specific input access needs.
- This awareness can help guide inclusive and accessible software efforts. It's important to remember that supporting adaptive or alternate hardware uses benefits many gamers, in addition to people with mobility-related disabilities. For example, players without vision are likely unable to use inputs that require hand-eye coordination like a mouse. If they cannot see where UI elements are located on the screen, they may have difficulty moving their cursor to those elements. In cases like this, supporting a wide array of hardware devices like keyboards, switch access and more for gaming experiences will enable more players to enjoy your title or platform.
