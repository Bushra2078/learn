You're now familiar with some of the common software-based assistive technologies used by players. AT, however, also includes hardware and physical devices.

In this unit, you'll learn about some common hardware AT devices used for gaming access. This unit also discusses important considerations for developers regarding the impact of AT hardware use on player experiences. These insights can help guide the approaches developers can take to support players who use these technologies.

## What are the common types of hardware assistive technologies used in gaming?

Many hardware AT devices may be referred to as "adaptive" input devices or  "adaptive controllers." In general, these devices provide players who have difficulty using standard input devices like commercial controllers, a mouse and keyboard, etc. with an accessible alternative.

In the following video, you'll learn about some common AT devices like the Xbox Adaptive Controller, switch buttons, mouth-operated joysticks and more.

## Hardware considerations for accessible game development

When supporting a player’s ability to use the assistive input device of their choice, considerations around compatibility and usability of these devices within the context of a specific game or platform should be assessed.
You have been introduced to unique challenges that players who use these input devices may experience. Next, you will learn about approaches that can be taken by developers to support these players.

### Consider device compatibility

When creating games or platform experiences, it’s important to assess accessible input devices that players might use and make intentional efforts to support compatibility with these devices. In cases when the developer is not able to support a device, they should provide players with clear documentation that outlines the limitations. The following video describes points that should be considered when evaluating device compatibility at the game, platform, and hardware levels.

### Consider challenging game mechanics

Developers  should be familiar with gaming assistive technologies including awareness of how players with disabilities physically interact with these technologies and the unique challenges that game mechanics may pose.

The following video describes challenges encountered by developers and approaches they can take to help lessen physical input demands for players that use assistive input devices.
