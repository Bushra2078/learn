Contrast settings, as discussed in the introductory scenario, is just one of many types of software-based assistive technologies commonly used in gaming.

In this unit, you'll be introduced to other common software settings and tools. Additionally, you will learn how to best support players who use these technologies when creating new gaming experiences.

## What are the common types of software assistive technologies used in gaming?

Software-based assistive technologies  The following software-based programs and tools are used by players with disabilities to access technology in gaming contexts:

### Screen readers

Screen readers are a form of assistive technology that renders text or image content on screen aloud as speech or braille output. They are commonly used by individuals who are blind or have visual disabilities in which adjusting text size or color is not enough to render the text readable. Additionally, screen readers can be used by individuals with cognitive or learning disabilities that make reading difficult, or younger players who have no yet learned to read. In gaming, screen readers should essentially convey what is happening within the game UI in a way that is at parity to the experience a sighted user would have.

### Contrast settings

Some players may use high contrast modes at the platform-level on their devices. High contrast modes are intended to enhance the visibility of on-screen elements by changing color schemes or simplifying backgrounds. For example, High Contrast Mode is the name of a tool on the Xbox Platform that helps users more clearly distinguish elements on their screen by eliminating background images unnecessary to UI navigation and making the focus indicator stand out more prominently against the UI. It is primarily used by those with low vision, but is also beneficial to neurodiverse users, as the contrast mode simplifies the visual aspects of the user interface that some may find less distracting and therefore easier to navigate. High Contrast Mode is a console setting and is not applied to experiences outside of the Xbox platform navigation.

### Color filters

Color filters are typically settings or features that allow users to improve the visibility of elements on screen by applying. They are most commonly used by players with color blindness, and can help improve a player's ability to distinguish the difference between colors on screen. Color filters are another assistive technology that may be provided at the platform level for players. These filters may or may not work with specific applications or game titles on a platform depending on the technology and compatibility.

### Magnification tools

Magnification typically enlarges a portion of a screen or all of a screen so users can more easily see words and images. In gaming contexts, magnification tools can allow players to zoom in on specific areas of their gameplay environment to get a clearer look at the contents on screen. Magnification tools can help players with low vision enlarge screen elements to the point where they can be read or interpreted. Additionally, magnification tools can help players who are using small screens like mobile devices, or are playing on screens that are further away, making screen elements appear small.

### Accessible Player-to-player communication tools

Online player communication tools like voice chat may be inaccessible for players with disabilities who cannot hear what others are saying aloud. Additionally, players who cannot speak aloud or choose not to, will be unable to respond to other players in the voice channel. Assistive technologies like speech-to-text and text-to-speech are intended to make communication experiences between players accessible. These tools are provided by the gaming platform, however, it's important to ensure that platform-level assists are compatible with your game title specifically.

- Speech-to-text: Transcribes incoming speech from other players into text on-screen in real time so players who cannot hear voice chat can read what other players have said aloud on their screen.
- Text-to-speech: Converts text typed by the player into synthesized audio that is read aloud. This essentially allows players who cannot speak verbally to have their thoughts expressed to the rest of the players in their party aloud.

Text on the screen reads, Turn on speech-to-text to transcribe other players’ voices into text on your device, when you are in a system party chat.":::


### Captioning

Captions translate noise and dialogue from the game into text that appears on-screen. Captioning is useful for players who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing as they can help identify important audio cues, the character that is currently speaking, and what that character is saying. Captions are also used by players who do not have hearing-related disabilities but prefer to have the text appear on screen because they are in a loud environment or find that they can more easily remember storylines by reading text in addition to listening to it. Captions are another important assistive tool that can support players at the platform and individual game title levels to ensure audio is accessible.

### Input remapping

Input remapping allows players to reassign the functions on their standard input devices. Remapping capabilities are helpful in allowing players with limited mobility to change the arrangement of their controls through software. For example, if the default assignment for sprinting in a game is right stick-click and a player with a thumb injury finds performing that action difficult, they can remap the sprint function to a different button on their controller that is easier to activate via software.

:::image type="content" source="../media/input-remapping.png" alt-text="The Xbox Accessibility Controller Profile 1 settings screen is shown. Text on the screen reads, “Choose a button to map. Or press and hold a button.” Below the “A Button” list item is selected. Below, a “Map to” setting is displayed that is also set to “A Button.” Additional checkboxes are also shown, including “Swap sticks,” “Invert right stick Y axis,” “Invert left stick Y axis,” “Swap triggers,” and “Turn on vibration.” To the right, an Xbox controller is shown with a “Restore to default” button below it.":::

## Software considerations for game accessibility

In addition to common hardware assistive technologies, an awareness of common software assistive technologies, settings, and tools players may need to access gaming experiences is also important. Some key points to consider regarding these technologies include the following:

1. When developing game titles, it's important to assess whether or not assistive tools are supported by the platform(s) your title will ship on. If these tools are available at the platform level, are players able to use them in your title specifically? Either way, you should consider providing these tools at the game title level. This will ensure that regardless of the platform a player is on, these tools will provide a more accessible experience.
2. When developing gaming platforms or platform features, it's important to assess whether or not the platform provides these assistive tools. If players cannot navigate the platform because it's not accessible, they will not be able to launch the games, applications, and other aspects of the platform that they wish to use. Additionally, platform developers can assess whether the assistive tools provided are accessible for game titles to use. For example, if a player has screen narration turned on at the platform level, are game titles able to access this information and enable screen narration upon game title launch as well?
