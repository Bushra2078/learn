The introductory scenario in this module describes a player who uses a software-based assistive technology. In gaming, many players commonly use hardware-based AT devices as well. Examples of hardware-based assistive technologies include input devices like large mountable buttons, adaptive joysticks, and mouth operated controls.

This unit introduces common hardware assistive technologies used by players with disabilities. The unit describes how the use of these devices can impact the experiences of the players using them. These insights can help guide the approaches developers can take to support players who use these technologies.

## What are the common types of hardware assistive technologies used in gaming?

Adaptive or accessible game input devices are intended to match the functionality of traditional input devices, but in a physical form factor that has been adapted to meet the needs of an individual player. Examples of assistive gaming input devices include the following:

 - Switch Buttons: These are buttons of diverse sizes that can be used in place of standard gaming input devices like the buttons on a standard controller or keys on a keyboard. Unlike standard input devices that are typically activated by the press of a player’s finger, switch buttons can be mounted anywhere. Switch buttons help enable players to activate buttons with their palms, elbows, knees, head, and other body parts.
 - Adaptive Joysticks: These are joysticks that vary in size, tension, and access options. These devices may be used by players with disabilities who have difficulty accessing the thumb sticks on a standard controller or difficulty using a mouse.
 - Adaptive and Custom Controllers: The Xbox Adaptive Controller functions as a “hub” for transmitting inputs from hardware, like switches or adaptive joysticks, to gaming platforms. Supported platforms include Xbox One and newer consoles, mobile devices running the latest iOS and Android  operating systems,   and PC platforms running Windows 10 or higher.

The following video provides a discussion of these devices in greater detail and shows players using these devices in real gaming environments.

## Hardware considerations for accessible game

When supporting a player’s ability to use the assistive input device of their choice, considerations around compatibility and usability of these devices within the context of a specific game or platform should be assessed.
You have been introduced to unique challenges that players who use these input devices may experience. Next, you will learn about approaches that can be taken by developers to support these players.

### Consider device compatibility

When creating games or platform experiences, it’s important to assess accessible input devices that players might use and make intentional efforts to support compatibility with these devices. In cases when the developer is not able to support a device, they should provide players with clear documentation that outlines the limitations. The following video describes points that should be considered when evaluating device compatibility at the game, platform, and hardware levels.

### Consider challenging game mechanics

Developers  should be familiar with gaming assistive technologies including awareness of how players with disabilities physically interact with these technologies and the unique challenges that game mechanics may pose.

The following video describes challenges encountered by developers and approaches they can take to help lessen physical input demands for players that use assistive input devices.
