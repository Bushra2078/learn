  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following best describes the use of switch buttons for gaming access?"
    choices:
    - content: "Buttons that players use to switch between first- and third-person camera views. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a player may assign this action to a switch button, the purpose of switch buttons are not limited to the switching camera view function alone."
    - content: "Buttons that are the same size as the buttons on traditional game input devices but can be mounted anywhere."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it is true that switch buttons can be mounted where a player needs them, they come in various shapes and sizes."
    - content: "Buttons that are used by players who typically cannot access a standard keyboard or controller."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Switch buttons are utilized in gaming by individuals who are unable to press any or all of the keys on a keyboard or buttons on a controller required to activate game functions."
  - content: "Which of the following statements does NOT describe why it is important for developers to become familiar with the hardware-based assistive technologies players use?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ensure that players using assistive devices can participate in all aspects of the game, regardless of the body parts or movements they use to activate their controls."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement would be considered one of the important reasons that developers should become familiar with hardware AT."
    - content: "To ensure the games and platforms they create support a multitude of different input types (controller, mouse, keyboard, etc.) that assistive technologies are 'seen' as."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement would be considered one of the important reasons that developers should become familiar with hardware AT."
    - content: "To ensure that multi-player servers distinctly call out players who are using assistive devices to other players on the server for visibility."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This option does not accurately describe the importance of developers becoming familiar with hardware AT discussed in this module. While multiplayer servers that clearly distinguish the general type of input (mouse and keyboard vs controller) that players seek out may be considered valuable by some players, calling out an individualâ€™s specific AT, such as an eye gaze bar or Xbox adaptive controller, is not suggested or recommended. It's also not an important or feasible reason for developers to broaden their knowledge about hardware AT."
