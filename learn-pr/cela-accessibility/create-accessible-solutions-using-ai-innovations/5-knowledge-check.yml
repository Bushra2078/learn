  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the benefit of allowing keyboard interaction for AI copilots?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows users to use voice commands instead of typing. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Voice commands are not the same as keyboard interaction. Allowing keyboard interaction for AI copilots does not imply that users can use voice commands instead of typing."
    - content: "It allows users to access the system without downloading any software."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Keyboard interaction is a feature of the user interface, not the installation process. Users may still need to download software to access the system, depending on the platform and the device."
    - content: "It allows users to navigate and interact with the system using the keyboard. "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "People with disabilities may use assistive technology to navigate these systems. By ensuring they are keyboard access, people who use the keyboard can easily use the AI tools."
    - content: "It allows users to customize the appearance and layout of the system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Keyboard interaction does not change the visual appearance of the AI system."
  - content: "What is the benefit of providing simple and clear prompt suggestions for AI copilots?"
    choices:
    - content: "It reduces the amount of data and bandwidth required by the system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Reducing the amount of data and bandwidth required by the system is not a benefit of providing simple and clear prompt suggestions, but rather a technical feature of the system. Prompt suggestions are designed to help users generate content that meets their needs, not to optimize the system's performance."
    - content: "It increases the accuracy and reliability of the system's output."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Increasing the accuracy and reliability of the system's output is not the main purpose of user testing and evaluation, but rather a possible outcome of it."
    - content: "It makes the system understandable by a global audience and avoids complex terms."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By providing clear prompt suggestions, people with disabilities can easily select these prompts to generate clear content that meets the needs of the user. It enhances the security and privacy of the system and the user's data."
    - content: "It enhances the security and privacy of the system and the user's data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Enhancing the security and privacy of the system and the user's data is not the main purpose of user testing and evaluation, but rather a design principle that should be followed throughout the development process."
  - content: "What is the main purpose of user testing and evaluation of accessible and inclusive AI solutions?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ensure the solution meets user expectations and requirements and does not produce any unintended consequence or harm."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: " User testing and evaluation can help identify and address any potential issues or risks related to usability, accessibility, inclusion, fairness, accountability, and transparency of the solution."
    - content: "To compare the performance of the solution with other existing solutions in the market."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Comparing the solution with other solutions might be useful for benchmarking or marketing purposes, but it does not necessarily reflect the user satisfaction or acceptance of the solution."
    - content: "To showcase the features and benefits of the solution to potential customers and investors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Your main priority should be the users of your system, and customers and investors will benefit."
    - content: "To comply with the ethical and legal standards and regulations for AI solutions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "User testing should aim to evaluate the solution from a broader perspective, considering the needs, expectations, and values of different user groups, and not only the individual preferences of some users."
  - content: "Why is it important to involve a diverse and representative sample of users in user testing and evaluation of accessible and inclusive AI solutions?"
    choices:
    - content: "To gain a competitive advantage over other AI solutions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Involving a diverse representative sample of users does not necessarily give a competitive advantage over other AI solutions"
    - content: "To persuade customers and investors to buy or support the solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Persuading customers and investors to buy or support the solution is not the main goal of involving a diverse representative sample of users, but rather a possible outcome of creating a more user-centered and trustworthy solution."
    - content: "To satisfy the personal preferences and opinions of the developers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The developers' personal preferences and opinions may not reflect the needs and expectations of the target user group and may introduce bias or discrimination in the design and development of the solution."
    - content: "To avoid any bias or discrimination in the design and development of the solution. "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By involving a diverse representative sample of users, you can avoid any bias or discrimination in the design and development of the solution and ensure that it meets the needs and preferences of all potential users. This can also enhance the accessibility, usability, and trustworthiness of the solution."
