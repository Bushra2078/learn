It’s essential that we build a future where people of all abilities benefit from technology. People with disabilities have a fundamental right to access technology. And breakthroughs such as generative AI, when done in an accessible manner, can be a game changer for people with disabilities.

Two examples of how AI can remove barriers and help people with disabilities be their best selves are “energy management” and “discoverability.”

- **Energy management**: The spoon theory explains that people living with chronic illness, chronic pain, and disability have limited energy resources. They also expend more energy on everyday tasks than people without illness and disability. With a virtual assistant to support design and other tasks, AI gives these individuals some of their time back, producing the joy of barrier-free creativity.  
- **Discoverability**: Another often ignored barrier to equal access to technology is discoverability. This is the degree to which something, especially a piece of content or information, can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system. Technology can become so feature-rich that many people may not know anymore what is available or what can be done with a tech solution.  

The following video explains how an individual with disabilities leverage [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) as their “everyday AI companion” to enhance productivity, creativity, energy management, and discoverability.
