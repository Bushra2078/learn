Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform many domains and industries across education, health, entertainment, and business. By enabling new ways to interact, communicate, and assist – AI can also offer new opportunities and solutions for accessibility.

However, AI also poses ethical and social challenges for accessibility. These challenges include managing AI systems for privacy, fairness, accountability, inclusiveness, and transparency. If not done responsibly, AI could create new barriers or risks for people with disabilities, such as the digital divide, bias or discrimination, and the loss of control or agency. Therefore, it's important to understand the principles and practices of responsible and inclusive AI for accessibility. 

## Which AI tech is used in accessible solutions? 

Simply put, AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Four key AI technologies used regularly in creating accessible solutions include:  

- **Machine learning** - This is often the foundation for an AI system and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data. 
- **Computer vision** - Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images. 
- **Natural language processing**- Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language and respond in kind. 
- **Speech recognition** - Also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR) or speech-to-text enables a program to process human speech into a written format.  
- **Generative AI** - Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.
