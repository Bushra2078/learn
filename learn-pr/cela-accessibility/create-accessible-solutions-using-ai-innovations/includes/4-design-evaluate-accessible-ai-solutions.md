While generative AI can greatly enhance productivity for people with disabilities, itâ€™s also important to understand the challenges and risks for accessibility they pose when not built responsibly, especially related to **biases** and **ableism**. 

- **Biases** are the unfair or inaccurate assumptions or preferences that affect the data, algorithms, or outcomes of generative AI. An example of bias is the lack of representation or diversity of people with disabilities in the data sets or models used for generative AI, which can lead to inaccurate, inappropriate, or harmful outputs. 
- **Ableism** is the discrimination or oppression of people with disabilities based on the assumption that they are inferior or less capable than others. An example of ableism in generative AI is the exclusion or marginalization of people with disabilities in the design, development, or evaluation of generative AI for accessibility. This exclusion prevents individuals with disabilities from having a voice or a choice in the solutions that affect them.

Therefore, it is important to consider the ethical and social implications of generative AI for accessibility and to involve people with disabilities as co-creators and stakeholders in the process. When this is done, generative AI can become a powerful tool for empowering and enabling people with disabilities, rather than a source of harm or discrimination.  

## Inclusive design principles for AI solutions

Designing accessible AI solutions requires understanding the specific user needs and contexts and applying the principles of inclusive design.  

To ensure a solution meets user expectations and requirements and does not produce any unintended consequences or harm, user testing and evaluation of accessible, inclusive AI solutions are essential.  

- User testing and evaluation should involve a diverse and representative sample of users, who can provide feedback on the usability, usefulness, and desirability of the solution.  
- User testing and evaluation can be conducted through various methods, such as interviews, surveys, observations, or experiments, depending on the research questions and goals.  
- User testing and evaluation results should inform improvement and refinement of the solution.
