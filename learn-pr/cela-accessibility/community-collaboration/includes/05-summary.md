In this module, you have learned about the importance of collaborating with the gaming and disability community to inform inclusive design and accessibility efforts.

Letâ€™s recap by considering these questions: Why should gaming products and experiences be developed in collaboration with the disability community? How can you ensure these perspectives are included?

Possible answers are as follows:
