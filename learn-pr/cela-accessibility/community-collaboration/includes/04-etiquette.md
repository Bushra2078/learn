Once you've established a way to engage with members of the gaming and disability community, you can begin inviting these community members to provide accessibility feedback. Shortly after, you may begin hosting these collaborative sessions online, or onsite at your studio.

This unit will provide best practice guidance that should be followed throughout the invitation and active collaboration process. Implementing these best practice guidelines can help ensure that the players you work with have an accessible and enjoyable experience.

## Set clear participant expectations

It's important to provide potential participants with detailed information on what they can expect prior to the research study or collaborative session. Providing this information ahead of time helps ensure that an informed decision can be made regarding a player's ability or willingness to work with your team.

The following video outlines the key information you should include within invitations. It also provides insights on the importance of providing this information.

## Provide accessible accommodations

Efforts to ensure that participants can access the physical space, hardware, virtual meeting platforms, and surveys that are being used during feedback sessions are another critical part of partnering with the gaming and disability community.

### Physical spaces

For in-person sessions, the physical spaces that participants will use must be accessible. Questions to consider when assessing the accessibility of your study or play test location include:
- Are all pathways between the parking lot and the building accessible?
- Are all entrances of buildings accessible for wheelchair users?
- Will participants be required to use stairs or elevators?
- Are restrooms accessible?
- Are the rooms being used for the study accessible and comfortable for participants? For example, small conference rooms with minimal space surrounding the conference table and chairs may be too “tight” for a wheelchair user to navigate.

> [!TIP]
> Give participants an opportunity to request more accommodations before agreeing to the collaborative session if needed.

### Online platforms

It's just as important to ensure that any virtual meeting platforms, survey platforms, and forms used are accessible. For example, participants who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing may need live transcription of what is being said in the meeting. If the virtual meeting platform does not provide that capability, that participant will be unable to participate. Additional questions to consider include:

- Do online documents and survey platforms comply with WCAG 2.1 web accessibility standards? Examples include the following:
     - Is all text within a survey accessible for those using a screen reader?
     -	Do the images provide proper alternative text (alt-text) descriptions?
     -	For users who are navigating the survey by using a keyboard alone, can all mechanisms and question types be accessed?

> [!NOTE]
> Common inaccessible survey mechanisms include questions where participants are asked to drag and drop elements to rank a list of items and dropdown lists.

## Follow language and disability etiquette best practices

Throughout this process, best practices for disability language and etiquette should always be followed. Using language or terminology that is not inclusive or performing actions not welcomed by a participant can negatively affect their experience. High-level guidance includes the following:
-	**Use Inclusive Language:** Person-first language such as “a person with a visual disability” is recommended by Microsoft. This differs from identity-first language in which someone may be described as “a visually impaired person.”

    Some people prefer to use identity-first language to describe themselves, such as “I am an autistic person,” or “I am a d/Deaf person.” If you are unsure of which language to use, it's okay to ask.

- **Practice Inclusive Etiquette:** Speak directly to the person to whom you are talking. Individuals may have a sign-language interpreter accompanying them and it's important to speak directly to the individual, and not the interpreter.

    Ask before doing. Individuals may have assistive tools such as wheelchairs, canes, guide dogs, or assistive hardware. It's important to ask participants if they need assistance before touching any of their devices. For example, you should ask a participant if they would like you to hand them their cane or fix their device before doing so.
