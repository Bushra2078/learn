To create accessible game experiences, players with disabilities should be included throughout the development process. This involvement is critical in informing accessibility features that truly meet the needs of the players who use them.

As a developer, you may have concerns about involving the user community during early development. Factors like confidentiality, launch delays, and additional costs can contribute to these concerns. However, without this community involvement, there's no guarantee that the final product will effectively provide an accessible experience.

Consider the following scenario. A developer creates a set of color-blind filters for their upcoming game. The feature releases without any input from players who are color-blind. Post-release, the team receives negative feedback. The filters intended to support these players instead made the game's UI even more difficult to see. The developer wasn't aware that colorblind filter implementation is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Had they worked with the community during feature development, they would have known to provide customizable options within the filter settings to meet the needs of individual players.

Without the insights of the gaming and disability community, a developer must make assumptions about proper feature implementation. Sometimes, these assumptions are wide of the mark.

In this module, you'll learn about the importance of collaborating with the gaming and disability community throughout the entire development process to inform accessible design. You'll learn about how these communities can be engaged, and when. You'll also learn how to ensure that these players have a great experience throughout this collaboration.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Describe the meaning of the concept of “nothing about us without us.” This concept promotes the inclusion of disability perspectives in accessible design.
- Identify ways to connect with the gaming and disability community to gather feedback.
- Implement best practice etiquette during collaborative sessions.
