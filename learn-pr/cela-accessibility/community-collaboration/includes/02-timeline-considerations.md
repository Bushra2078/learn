The developer in the introductory scenario did not engage the disability community during the development process. They may have been unsure of where to start, or had concerns about launch timelines and bandwidth. In this unit, you'll learn foundational community engagement concepts that address these concerns including:

-	Approaches that can be taken to streamline disability feedback into existing feedback loops
-	The importance of engaging diverse users and perspectives
-	Potential ways to gather feedback regardless of where your team is at in the development cycle

## Embed accessibility feedback into existing feedback processes

If your team is new to accessibility, gathering disability perspectives may seem overwhelming. This doesnâ€™t have to be the case. Think about the standard processes your team or organization follows when gathering general user feedback or conducting user research outside of accessibility.
For example, perhaps your team already sends surveys, conducts regular research studies, or runs play tests for all products in development. If so, one way to begin gathering disability feedback without creating entirely new processes or programs is simply ensuring that players with disabilities are included within these existing participant pools.

>[!Note]
> We recommend partnering with your user research team for these engagements if possible. These teams have training and expertise in how to pose meaningful questions and analyze data. If you do not have user research resources available, efforts to embed accessibility perspectives into feedback loops can still be explored.

## Include diverse users and perspectives

Before you get started, you may have questions like "how many players with disabilities should be included in a feedback session," or "how do I know that the feedback from one player represents the feedback of other players with similar disabilities?" While there's no definitive answer or guideline, it's important to note that the experience of one player with a disability can widely differ from another.

Given this, consider including a diverse set of users and perspectives. For example, if you're looking for feedback on the visual accessibility of your game's UI, you should consider feedback from multiple players with different types of visual disabilities.

## Gather feedback across development timelines

It's also important to remember that accessibility feedback can, and should, be gathered throughout all points of the development process. This collaboration ideally starts with initial planning and goal setting stages. When you consider accessibility from the very beginning, you avoid situations where accessibility features are added as last-minute efforts. They're not effectively integrated within the game's design.

Last-minute efforts to implement accessibility solutions are unlikely to provide players with the same support and effectiveness as achieved when accessibility is prioritized consistently from start to finish.

The following information outlines potential ways to gather feedback throughout various points in development:

- **Pre-development:** Even if your team has not begun formal planning or development, there are still opportunities to engage the disability community. Consider using this time to gather foundational insights from players about frequent barriers they've experienced in the past while playing other games of similar genres to what your team will develop. An awareness of these barriers prior to actual development can help you avoid introducing them in your game altogether.

- **Early planning and goal setting:** Once early planning and goals have been established, this information can also be used to source feedback. Players can improve accessible development by identifying potential barriers that the anticipated settings, mechanics, and other design elements may pose. They can also provide valuable feedback on your proposed accessibility goals and plans to achieve them.

- **Prototype testing:** Once working prototypes or game builds are available, consider providing hands-on opportunities for players to provide feedback through play tests or user research studies. These hands-on interactions are crucial to informing suggestions for improvement within the context of your specific game.

    As the experience or device goes through re-iteration, continue to involve players with disabilities testing. This can ensure that future design iterations continue to provide effective and usable solutions for these players.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > It can seem tempting to wait until playable prototypes are available to begin engaging the community. However, it's important to think about all of the potential barriers identified by these players in earlier development stages. Without this feedback, your team may have included a multitude of inaccessible experiences within their prototype that they were unaware of.

    > At this point in development, it may be too late to tackle a long list of issues identified, resulting in continued inaccessible experiences at launch. Collaboration throughout development can reduce the chances of major barriers to access appearing at this stage of development.
