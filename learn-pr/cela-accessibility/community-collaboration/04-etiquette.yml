  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Why is it important to provide clear participant expectations?"
    choices:
    - content: "So participants can guess the types of responses that they should be provided once they begin the actual feedback session."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Participant expectations are not intended to give the participant insider knowledge about the product they will be testing. Genuine feedback based on an individual participant’s experience is sought after and useful in creating a product that is accessible."
    - content: "So participants can assess whether they will be able to comfortably complete any tasks or answer questions presented to them before traveling to an on-site session or attending a remote session."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By providing participants with clear expectations on what the study or feedback session will require of them, they can make an informed decision on whether they can or would like to participate."
    - content: "So participants are already familiar with the game or product they will be testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Participant expectations are not intended to give the participant insider knowledge about the product they will be testing. Genuine feedback based on the individual participant’s experience is sought after and useful in creating a product that is accessible."
  
  - content: "Assess the following scenario and choose which of the options presented describes an alternative approach the employee could have taken to align more closely with the etiquette guidance provided in this module: As a participant is leaving, an attachment on their wheelchair collides with the door frame and falls to the ground. An employee immediately picks up the part and attempts to reattach it to the participant’s wheelchair."
    choices:
    - content: "The employee should have ignored the fact that the player’s wheelchair attachment fell so they don’t draw attention to the player’s disability or the fact that they use a wheelchair."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This approach does not align with the etiquette guidance in this module. It may result in an unsafe situation for the player. Politely asking if the player would like assistance is appropriate and allows the player to decline help if it is not needed."
    - content: "The employee should have first told the player that they planned to reattach the item that fell off their wheelchair before doing so."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This approach does not align with the etiquette guidance in this module. The employee does give a verbal indication of their intent to fix the wheelchair before physically doing so. However, this communication is opposition to the “ask before doing” best practice etiquette. The employee should ask the participant if they would like assistance picking up the fallen part or reattaching it to the chair before acting."
    - content: "The employee should have first asked if the individual wanted help before reattaching the part to their wheelchair."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Following the best practice guidelines outlined in this module, the “ask before doing” policy should always guide these interactions. Assistive technologies and wheelchair attachments can be expensive and at risk of being broken if handled incorrectly. Assistive technologies are often considered as personal property, or within the personal space, of the owner and should be treated accordingly."
