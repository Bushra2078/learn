  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options is most likely to introduce unintentional visual barriers?"
    choices:
    - content: "An on-screen countdown clock graphic that also announces the number of seconds left aloud through audio channels."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By representing the countdown timer both audibly and visually, a visual barrier is more likely to be avoided."
    - content: "A game represents incoming enemy damage with a red halo on-screen, and an audio cue of the character grunting."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By representing enemy damage both audibly and visually, a visual barrier is more likely to be avoided."
    - content: "A game identifies enemy characters with a red outline and ally characters with a green outline."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Individuals who are color blind may not be able to distinguish between enemies and allies, thus presenting a visual barrier."
  - content: "Which of the following options would likely be useful in assisting a player without vision?"
    choices:
    - content: "A screen magnification tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While useful for someone with low vision, a player without vision cannot benefit from screen magnification as it requires that the user can visually perceive the larger on-screen elements."
    - content: "Menu narration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Menu narration can allow someone who has no vision to navigate through the gameâ€™s user interface."
    - content: "Resizable text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While useful for someone with low vision, someone without vision cannot benefit from text resizing as it requires that the user can visually perceive the larger text."
  - content: "Which of the following options is not a reason that developers should have a foundational awareness of diverse player experiences when learning about game accessibility?"
    choices:
    - content: "So developers can use this foundational awareness to immediately implement changes in their games."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Foundational developer awareness of differing player experiences should not be used to make immediate development decisions. This awareness is intended to drive developer's understanding of accessibility as an effort that cannot be achieved with a one-size-fits-all approach. It is intended to encourage developers to collaborate with players who have lived experiences with accessibility barriers to inform effective accessibility solutions."
    - content: "To drive awareness of the fact that game accessibility is not a one-size-fits-all approach."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This option is a reason that developers should have a foundational awareness of diverse player experiences. Without an awareness of diverse player needs and experiences, gaming experiences and products may ship without addressing the needs of large groups of players."
    - content: "To drive developer understanding of the importance of including the perspectives and guidance of players with each of these lived experiences to inform any future accessible design efforts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This option is a reason that developers should have a foundational awareness of diverse player experiences. Without an awareness of these diverse experiences, developers may leave out key groups of players that should be involved in the design process of a game or experience."
