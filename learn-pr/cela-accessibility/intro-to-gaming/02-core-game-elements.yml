  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following examples is most likely to introduce unintentional barriers related to visual information?"
    choices:
    - content: "An on-screen countdown clock graphic that also announces the number of seconds left aloud through audio channels."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A timer that announces the time left through audio provides an additional means to consume the information."
    - content: "The player's current health status is represented by an on-screen meter graphic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Any information that is shown only through UI, and not accessible by a screen reader makes that information inaccessible to players with visual disabilities."
    - content: "A game that uses large text sizes by default, therefore other customization options are not provided."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A default size that is large to some players may be unreadable for others. Without customization options, unintentional barriers can occur."
  - content: "Which of the following examples is most likely to introduce unintentional barriers related to performing cognitive tasks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Providing players with an option to enable reminders of which button to use on a jump sequence."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Providing in game reminders of what game mechanics to use for a particular action eliminates the need for a player to remember all combinations."
    - content: "Providing players with a list of objectives at the beginning of a level that cannot be referenced again until the level is complete."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This situation places a demand on players to memorize information critical to gameplay. Players who cannot recall the information can experience unintentional barriers that block progress."
    - content: "Providing tutorials of new mechanics introduced in gameplay."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Providing an opportunity for players to try out and familiarize themselves with new mechanics in a trial space removes barriers."
  - content: "Which of the following approaches can help eliminate unintentional barriers related to input?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provide different options for input devices, documented in accessible support articles."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Providing options for players who use different assistive technologies, inputs and devices to play, and making that information available ahead of purchase removes barriers to players with disabilities."
    - content: "Provide options to skip specific portions of the game that require challenging mechanics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Removing portions of the game is not an appropriate way to create a more accessible experience. Doing so would change the nature of the game and eliminate the intentional challenges that make the game unique."
    - content: "Provide additional tutorials in the game for players to practice challenging button press combinations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Providing additional tutorials is a good practice for all players, but should assumed that practice alone will remove the barrier to play."
