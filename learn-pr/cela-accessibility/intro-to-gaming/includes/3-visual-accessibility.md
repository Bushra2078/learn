The team in the introductory scenario has already established that their game will include rich visuals and audio, and puzzle-based challenges. The game will ship on PC, console, and mobile devices. This means that players will also be required to use physical input devices to play.

With this preliminary information, the team can begin to think about how:

- Their game presents important information to players
- Players may experience barriers to accessing this information when it's not presented in an accessible way

Additionally, the team can consider the cognitive and physical demands that their game poses as players attempt to:

- Problem-solve through puzzle-based challenges
- Operate input devices over the course of their play session with the speed and accuracy needed to be successful

In this unit, you'll learn about common game elements that can pose unintentional barriers to access for players with disabilities. An awareness of these common elements is an important first step in determining where players can be unintentionally excluded during the preliminary stages of development.

## Identifying visual elements

Many gaming experiences today use visual cues or indicators to guide player success. In game accessibility, it's important to think about the following questions related to visual information:

- Is important information represented through visual means? For example, text-based menus and instructions, on-screen icons, and more.
- Is the visual representation of this information accessible to players with visual disabilities?
- How is gameplay impacted if a player cannot access this visual information due to lack of accessible supports?

In the following video, you'll learn how to identify common visual elements that should be considered in the context of these questions.

Identifying these elements is an important first step in accessible game development. When these elements are identified early in development, initiatives can be taken to ensure that they provide is also represented through non-visual means.

## Vision and disability

Visual disabilities can impact player experiences across a wide spectrum. Players may experience any combination of the following:

Player experiences can be impacted by visual disabilities across a wide spectrum. The way players perceive visual information while gaming can include:

- A complete lack of sight or ability to see game visuals
- Varying degrees of blurriness
- An incomplete view, or missing portions of their screen or UI
- Difficulty distinguishing colors within the UI
- Impacted depth perception and more

A general awareness of these differences is an important first step in providing solutions that support a broad range of players.

### Gaming without vision

Your future customers will likely include players who cannot see any aspect of their screen or gaming device. These players must interpret all information from a game through audio or haptic channels alone. This means that common visual accessibility settings like adjusting text size or contrast will not be helpful for these players.

Youâ€™re encouraged to think about how all visual information in a game can be represented entirely through non-visual means. Examples of this include:

- Ensure all text-based elements (in menus, heads-up display, and text-based player chat) can be read aloud via screen narration.
- Represent environmental cues such as the location of a nearby exit door, interactable object, or enemy character through spatial audio.

### Gaming and low vision

Low vision is a broad term that can encompass a wide spectrum of visual abilities. Players with low vision may have a cloudier, blurrier, or less complete view of what is on their game screen.

> [!NOTE]
> The extent of cloudiness, blurriness, or completeness of view can widely vary from player to player. This is why providing multiple options for customization is important.

Players with low vision can experience difficulty reading text or seeing on-screen visual elements. To ensure gameplay experiences are accessible for players with varying degrees of low vision, you should consider providing players with customization options for the following:

- The size of text in menus, within the game environment, and within chat-based player-to-player communications.
- The size of visual elements like waypoint markers, cross hairs, and other important visual indicators.
- The color and contrast of text and visual elements by enabling solid backgrounds against them and providing choice of color for the element and its background color.
- The location that visual elements like chat boxes, notifications, HUD displays, and more appear on screen.
