The development team in the introductory scenario has already established that their game will include rich visuals and audio as well as a puzzle-based theme. The game will ship on PC, console, and mobile devices; this means that players will also be required to use physical input devices to play.

With this preliminary information, the team can begin to think about how:
- The game presents important information to players
- The portrayal of this information can impact a player’s ability to use this information

Additionally, the team can consider the cognitive and physical demands that their game poses as players attempt to:

In this unit, we’ll explore core game elements and methods of information portrayal that you should consider in the preliminary stages of game development. An awareness of these common elements is an important first step in determining where players are being unintentionally excluded.

NOTE: While vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility-based elements are addressed in this introductory module, it’s important to note that there are many other game elements that impact accessibility. This includes elements related to:
- Speech and communication
- Sensory demands
- Mental health and more

Additional information about these player experiences can be found in the summary and resources unit of this module.

## Identifying visual elements

Gaming experiences are often reliant on information and cues portrayed visually. However, players visual disabilities can be excluded from play when information is represented through visual means alone. Let’s break down the common ways that games require vision to inform play.

Consider the following scenario:

A player sees enemies approaching from the top left corner of their screen. Based on this visual information, they make the following decisions:
- They check their current health meter status. They see their health bar is half-full.
- They check the amount of ammunition they have. Their ammunition count is zero.
- Based on these three visual elements (incoming enemies, their health bar status, and their ammunition count), they decide to flee in the opposite direction of the incoming enemies. They know they will not be successful in battle with low health and zero ammunition.

The visual information this player perceived on-screen prompted a set of actions and decisions that affected the outcome of their success in gameplay. If the player did not have access to all of this visual information, they may have experienced negative gameplay outcomes.

Identifying these elements is an important first step in accessible game development. When these elements are identified early in development, initiatives can be taken to ensure that they provide is also represented through non-visual means.

## Identifying hearing-based elements

Like visual elements, gaming experiences also use audio-based elements to portray information needed to navigate the experience. Think about the importance of audio-based information in the following scenario.

A player is exploring a wooded area in the game. While the visual game environment remains the same, suddenly the game’s music becomes slow and ominous. The sound of footsteps rattles in the distance.

Based on these audio cues, the player assumes impending danger. Before deciding to continue in the direction of the footsteps, they now know to first check their health and ammunition levels. The player makes the informed decision to avoid this area of the game until they collect more weapons and health potions.

A player with a hearing disability, however, may have been unaware of this cue and walked into danger.

In contrast, audio outputs that are too loud or intense may also pose unintentional barriers. Players who are sensitive to audio output may find loud or dramatic audio to be overwhelming from a sensory or cognitive perspective.

It is important to identify areas where audio plays a key role in gameplay. This is an important first step to ensure that the following players can customize their experience to meet their needs and preferences.

## Identifying cognition-based elements

After players receive information provided by the game, they must then decide how they want to use this information to proceed. These decisions commonly require players to engage in cognitive processes like:

- Maintaining close attention to the cues and information the game provides to ensure no key information is missed.
- Memorizing this information over prolonged periods of time (throughout the course of a mission, or in between play periods).
- Recalling memorized information to assess what the information implies in the context of the task or objective at hand.

Perhaps a player is stuck within a level of a game because they cannot figure out how to unlock the door to the next level. At this point, the player must recall what has happened in the game thus far and think through the potential cues or elements they may have missed along the way that would unlock the door.

Even if they were to revisit previous levels in the game, they may continue to overlook cues that are not obvious or attention-grabbing. At some point, the player realizes that they missed a series of key fragments that must be arranged in a specific pattern before the door will unlock.

Leading up to this moment, the player has already been tasked with memorizing previous parts of the game and sustaining a great deal of attention to be sure “hidden” objects are not missed again. Now the player must problem-solve their way through the game and determine the correct pattern for the key fragments.

These cognitive processes may be more difficult to execute for players with learning, attention, or memory-related disabilities. The solution to this problem, however, is not for game developers to eliminate challenges related to problem solving or cognitive tasks. Instead, allowing players to customize the level of support they receive from the game to assist them in completing cognitive tasks can create more accessible experiences.

## Identifying input-based elements

After cognitive decisions are made about next steps in the game, players must act upon those decisions. This typically requires players to move their fingers with speed, precision, and coordination as they interact with physical input devices. These experiences can introduce unintentional barriers for players with physical disabilities when:

- Platforms or game titles only support a specific type of input device that some players cannot physically use.
- Challenging mechanics like rapidly pressing buttons, pressing multiple buttons at once, or holding buttons down are required actions to progress in gameplay.
- Players must be able to activate a multitude of different inputs to engage in basic play.
Suppose a player with limited movement in their hands and fingers wishes to play a trending new game with their friends. The game is launched on PC platforms, and only supports keyboard and mouse inputs.

Players must perform the following actions to stay alive in the game long enough to progress to future levels:
- Operate their mouse with quick, precise motions to accurately aim at moving targets
- Fire their weapon rapidly until enemy health is depleted
- Reload their weapon when their ammunition has run out
- Perform character actions like uppercut, forward punch, jump, and roll to reach high platforms or travel into small, low spaces in the game

Players who are physically unable to perform these actions will experience unintentional barriers that can block engagement in gameplay altogether. Removing the presence of enemies altogether would not be an appropriate way to create a more accessible experience. Doing so would change the nature of the game and eliminate the intentional challenges that make the game unique.

Instead, developers can create more accessible experiences by allowing players to use the input devices of their choice. Additionally, players should be able to customize their input settings. This will allow players to lessen the physical demands required to perform necessary game tasks.
