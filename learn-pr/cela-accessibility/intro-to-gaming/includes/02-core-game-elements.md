The team in the introductory scenario has already established that their game will include rich visuals and audio, and puzzle-based challenges. The game will ship on PC, console, and mobile devices. This means that players will also be required to use physical input devices to play.

With this preliminary information, the team can begin to think about how:

- Their game presents important information to players
- Players may experience barriers to accessing this information when it's not presented in an accessible way

Additionally, the team can consider the cognitive and physical demands that their game poses as players attempt to:

- Problem-solve through puzzle-based challenges
- Operate input devices over the course of their play session with the speed and accuracy needed to be successful

In this unit, you'll learn about common game elements that can pose unintentional barriers to access for players with disabilities. An awareness of these common elements is an important first step in determining where players can be unintentionally excluded during the preliminary stages of development.

> [!NOTE]
> While vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility-based elements are addressed in this introductory module, itâ€™s important to note that there are many other game
elements that impact accessibility.
>
> This includes elements related to:
>
> - Speech and communication
> - Sensory demands
> - Mental health and more
>
> Additional information about these player experiences can be found in the summary and resources unit of this module.

## Identifying visual elements

Many gaming experiences today use visual cues or indicators to guide player success. In game accessibility, it's important to think about the following questions related to visual information:

- Is important information represented through visual means? For example, text-based menus and instructions, on-screen icons, and more.
- Is the visual representation of this information accessible to players with visual disabilities?
- How is gamplay impacted if a player cannot access this visual information due to lack of accessible supports?

In the following video, you'll learn how to identify common visual elements that should be considered in the context of these questions.

Identifying these elements is an important first step in accessible game development. When these elements are identified early in development, initiatives can be taken to ensure that they provide is also represented through non-visual means.

## Identifying audio elements

Like visual elements, gaming experiences also use audio-based elements to portray information needed to navigate the experience. When this audio based information is not represented in an accessible way, players with hearing-related disabilities may be excluded from using this information.

In the following video, you'll learn how to identify common audio-based elements that can pose unintentional barriers for players. 

It's important to identify areas where audio plays a key role in gameplay. This is an important first step to ensure that the following players can customize their experience to meet their needs and preferences.

## Identifying cognitive elements

After players receive information provided by the game, they must then decide how they want to use this information to proceed. These decisions commonly require players to engage in cognitive processes like:

- Maintaining close attention to the cues and information the game provides to ensure no key information is missed.
- Memorizing this information over prolonged periods of time (throughout the course of a mission, or in between play periods).
- Recalling memorized information to assess what the information implies in the context of the task or objective at hand.

These cognitive processes may be more difficult to execute for players with learning, attention, or memory-related disabilities. When accessibility supports and features that address these cognitive demands are not provided, these players can experience unintentional barriers.

In the following video, you'll learn how to identify common cognitive elements that can pose these barriers.

## Identifying input-based elements

After cognitive decisions are made about next steps in the game, players must act upon those decisions. This typically requires players to move their fingers with speed, precision, and coordination as they interact with physical input devices. These experiences can introduce unintentional barriers for players with physical disabilities when:

- Platforms or game titles only support a specific type of input device that some players cannot physically use.
- Challenging mechanics like rapidly pressing buttons, pressing multiple buttons at once, or holding buttons down are required actions to progress in gameplay.
- Players must be able to activate a multitude of different inputs to engage in basic play.

In the following video, you'll learn to identify common input-based elements that can pose unintentional barriers to access for players when proper accessible supports and features are not provided.
