Video games are a staple of modern-day culture. They provide entertainment, connect communities, and foster shared experiences. When accessibility efforts are intentionally included throughout the development process, gaming experiences can be enjoyed by more inclusive audiences.

Consider the following scenario: Your team is developing a new game title. They want to ensure that as many players as possible can enjoy it. The goal is to create a multiplayer combat game with puzzle-based elements, rich visuals, and audio. The team is new to the accessibility space and are not sure where to begin.

Specifically, they’re unsure of things like:
- How to understand gameplay through the lens of accessibility
- How common design elements can introduce inaccessible experiences
- How gameplay experiences differ for players with different types of disabilities

In this module, you’ll learn about how games are played. You’ll learn about the common elements and mechanics within gaming experiences that influence accessibility. You’ll also learn about the impact that these elements can have on the experiences of players with specific types of disabilities.  

By the end of this module, you will be able to identify core game experiences that commonly introduce accessibility barriers for players with visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive disabilities.

After completing this module, the learner will be able to:
1. Describe the process of how games are played through the lens of accessibility.
2. Identify common elements and game mechanics that may introduce accessibility barriers for players with visual, hearing, cognitive, or mobility disabilities.
3. Identify appropriate methods to address inaccessible game elements for each sub-category of vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility disabilities discussed in this module.
