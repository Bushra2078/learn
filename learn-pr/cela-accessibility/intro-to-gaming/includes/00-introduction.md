Video games are a staple of modern-day culture. They provide entertainment, connect communities, and foster shared experiences. When accessibility is included throughout the development entire process, gaming experiences can be enjoyed by more players.

Consider the following scenario: Your team is developing a new game title. They want to ensure that as many players as possible can enjoy it. The goal is to create a multiplayer combat game with puzzle-based elements, rich visuals, and audio. The team is new to the accessibility space and are not sure where to begin.

Specifically, they’re unsure of things like:

- How to understand gameplay through the lens of accessibility
- How common design elements can introduce inaccessible experiences
- How gameplay experiences differ for players with different types of disabilities

In this module, you’ll be introduced to foundational concepts about game accessibility. Specifically, you’ll learn about common game elements and mechanics that can pose unintentional barriers for players with disabilities.  

By the end of this module, you will be able to identify core game experiences that commonly introduce accessibility barriers for players with visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive disabilities.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

1. Assess gaming experiences through the lens of accessibility.
2. Identify common visual, hearing, cognitive, and input-based elements within gaming experiences that can impact accessibility.
3. Describe the importance of considering diverse player experiences when exploring accessible features and solutions.
