In the introduction to this module, you learned about a development team interested in creating accessible games who were unsure where to start.

Since the team develops games for a living, it’s fair to assume they know how games are played. But when it comes to game accessibility, it’s important to think about how players with disabilities play and experience games. This starts with an assessment of the following:

- How games provide information to players
- How players interpret this information
- How players act upon this information to guide successful gameplay

In this unit, you’ll be introduced to foundational concepts about gaming and disability. Specifically, you’ll learn how to assess the gameplay process within the context of disability to better understand how specific game elements or mechanics can introduce inaccessible experiences for players.

## How are games played?

The following video introduces basic concepts about disability and game accessibility. It discusses how to approach the question of “how games are played” within the context of disability. An understanding of this approach  helps you establish the foundation needed to begin your game accessibility journey.

NOTE: This foundation is built upon as you grow your accessibility subject matter expertise.
