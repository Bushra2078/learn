In the introduction to this module, you learned about a development team interested in creating accessible games who were unsure where to start.

The team develops games for a living, so it’s fair to assume they know how games are played. But when it comes to game accessibility, it’s important to think about this process with a wide range of player skills and abilities in mind. This starts with an assessment of the following:

- How games provide information to players
- How players interpret this information
- How players act upon this information to guide successful gameplay

In this unit, you’ll be introduced to foundational concepts about gaming and disability. Specifically, you’ll learn how to assess the gameplay process within the context of accessibility. This will increase your understanding of how specific game elements or mechanics can introduce inaccessible experiences for players.

## How are games played?

The following video introduces basic concepts about gaming and disability. It introduces ways to approach the question of “how games are played” within the context of accessibility. An understanding of this approach helps you establish the foundation needed to begin your game accessibility journey.
