## Summary

In this module, you’ve learned about core visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive elements present in game experiences and the wide array of experiences that players with disabilities can encounter while gaming.

- Game experiences are played through a series of feedback loops. These loops involve visual and audio information that is provided by the game. The player’s ability to perceive that information, determine next steps through cognitive reasoning, and provide physical input to act can impact their gaming success. When any aspect of this loop is interrupted, players may experience accessibility barriers.
- Many game elements commonly introduce visual, hearing, cognitive, and mobility demands that players with disabilities cannot perform. Developers should become aware of these common elements and make intentional efforts minimize barriers and their impact on players with disabilities.
- Game accessibility cannot be approached through a “one size fits all” mentality. Instead, it is important to break down unique barriers that game elements can introduce to different players and considered them individually.
