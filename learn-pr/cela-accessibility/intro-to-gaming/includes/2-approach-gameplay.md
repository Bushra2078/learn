In the introduction to this module, you learned about a team interested in creating accessible games who were unsure where to start.

The team develops games for a living, so it’s fair to assume they know how games are played. When approaching accessibility, however, it’s important to think about this process with a wide range of players in mind. This starts with an assessment of the following:

- How games provide information to players
- How players interpret this information
- How players act upon this information to guide successful gameplay

In this unit, you’ll be introduced to basic gaming and disability concepts. You’ll also learn how to assess the gameplay process within the context of accessibility. This will increase your understanding of how specific game elements or mechanics can introduce inaccessible experiences for players.

## How are games played?

The following video introduces basic concepts about gaming and disability. It introduces ways to approach the question of “how games are played” within the context of accessibility. An understanding of this approach helps you establish the foundation needed to begin your game accessibility journey.

## Solve for one, extend to many

Before exploring the specific game accessibility concepts about vision, audio, cognition, and input discussed in this module, it's important to first familiarize yourself with the inclusive design principle of "solve for one, extend to many."

“Solve for one, extend to many” means that intentional design efforts to create accessible experiences for people with disabilities often results in universally beneficial features and settings for anyone. For example, accessible automatic doors for wheelchair access are also often used by the following individuals:

- Individuals who have their hands full and cannot open the door.
- Individuals who wish to avoid touching door handles for hygienic reasons.

When it comes to game accessibility, it's important to note that options or features intended for a specific group of players often provide better experiences for all players.

For example, captions and subtitles are intended to make game experiences accessible to players who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing. They may also assist players who are easily distracted and miss audio cues or players in a loud environment can also benefit from these features.

As you learn about visual, audio, cognitive, and input accessibility concepts throughout this module, keep the broader impact of your future efforts in mind as well.
