Disability is defined as a mismatch in interaction between the features of a person's body and the features of the environment in which they live. In game accessibility, these mismatches can occur when a game requires specific abilities to play that differ from the level of ability that an individual player may have. Think back to the examples outlined above. When game titles, platforms, or hardware devices require specific skills or abilities that a player doesn't have, they can be blocked from play. When building accessible gaming experiences and hardware, it's important to understand the wide range of disabilities that players may have as this awareness and understanding is crucial in implementing proper design mechanics, settings, and features that can unblock players from inaccessible gaming experiences.

It's important to note that disability impacts players across a wide spectrum. One player with a visual disability can encounter vastly different accessibility barriers than another player with a visual disability. This module will introduce you to the wide range of disabilities that players may experience, and the ways in which these differences influence the accessibility of experiences. It's important to note that the information outlined in this module is introductory in nature as it's intended for those new to gaming accessibility. Disability is an incredibly broad and complex subject. The information in this module is intended to help provide the tools needed to understand gaming accessibility foundational principles and scope accessibility goals. Once you have a foundational understanding of gaming accessibility principles, it's important to actively collaborate with players with disabilities during design and development of experiences.

## Vision and Disability

Vision is incredibly complex. Visual disabilities can impact player experiences across a wide spectrum including a complete inability to see on-screen elements or hardware components, varying degrees of ability to see these aspects of gameplay or hardware, and varying degrees of ability to identify and perceive color when viewing on-screen elements or hardware components. These differences can result in aspects of gameplay being inaccessible for some players with visual disabilities, and accessible to others. An awareness of these differences is critical when it comes to identifying inaccessible experiences and implementing accessible solutions.

### No Vision

There are many players who cannot perceive any visual content related to games, platforms, and hardware. Reflect on the visual elements commonly present in gaming experiences outlined in the previous unit; directional cues within the game’s environment, the presence of enemies or interactable objects, and more. For these players, all visual elements on screen must somehow be represented entirely through non-visual means such as audio. You'll essentially have to answer the question of “how can I convey the information on-screen to players who cannot see it so they can still enjoy my game?”

While there are many best practice approaches to address this question, the focus of this introductory module is to first recognize the importance of representing this information through non-visual means, and second recognizing the fact that different solutions will be needed to address the different types of visual disabilities that a play may have. Here are some high-level examples of supporting players without vision through non-visual means:

In the following video, a Minecraft character walks around an open world environment. They receive incoming text-based chat messages from another player in their realm. Minecraft provides players an option to enable the narration of text-based chats. This informs players of what others are communicating to them in the game through audio instead.

Spatial navigation through a game environment is another major that is highly dependent on the ability to see what is on-screen. In Gears 5, players can determine the location of specific game elements through audio by enabling the navigation ping in some game modes. Enabling the navigation ping setting results in players being able to listen for frequent audio pings that inform the player of where certain objects in the game are located, such as exit doors, key navigation points, door buttons, and mantle points. Players with no vision can use these audio affordances to navigate aspects of gameplay.

When it comes to hardware, it's not always feasible to provide players options to adjust the visibility of important elements like labels. However, the Xbox Series S and X included tactile indicator bumps below each port on the back of the console. This allows players who cannot read text the text labels or icons above the ports to use touch to discern the indicator pattern and match it with the pattern referenced in online support documentation for ethernet, USB, HDMI, storage expansion, and power ports.

### Low Vision

Low vision is a broad term that can encompass a wide spectrum of visual abilities. Some players with low vision may have a cloudier, blurrier, or less complete view of what is on their game screen. The extent of cloudiness, blurriness, or completeness of view can also widely vary from player to player. This may impact a player’s ability to read text or notice on-screen elements like characters, objects, targeting icons, and more depending on the size, color, and location of these elements on screen. Text instructions may be present on-screen for a player to leverage, but if this text is too small, or the color of the text has a low contrast ratio against the background it sits on, a player may be unable to read it or be unaware of its presence altogether. To ensure gameplay experiences are accessible for players with varying degrees of low vision, settings and options that allow players to increase the size, contrast, or location of visual elements on-screen or on a hardware device should be provided.

Options to enhance the visibility for players with low vision can include settings like high contrast modes, customizing text size, and more as illustrated in the video below.  

### Color Vision Deficiency or Color Blindness

Color is another key component of visual information. Color vision deficiency, or colorblindness, can impact a player’s ability to discern the color of objects, or differentiate certain colors from others. In game scenarios, the use of color alone to portray information can be challenging for players with colorblindness. For example, eating green flowers increases health while red flowers diminishes health. Players with certain types of colorblindness cannot distinguish the difference between green and red.

Here are some common types of colorblindness and how they can impact a player's vision:

#### Red-Green Colorblindness

- Deuteranomaly: The most common type of red-green colorblindness. Players perceive green elements to be more red in color.
- Deuteranopia: A form of deuteranomaly with higher intensity. The ability to see green elements is difficult.
- Protanomaly: Players perceive red elements to be more green in color and they appear to be less bright.
- Protanopia and Deuteranopia: Players are unable to tell the difference between red and green altogether.

#### Blue-Yellow Color Blindness

- Tritanomaly: Players may have difficulty discerning the difference between blue and green elements, and between yellow and red elements.
- Tritanopia: Players are unable to discern the difference between green and blue elements, purple and red elements, and yellow and pink elements. Colors also appear less bright.

#### Complete Colorblindness

- Monochromacy: players do not see color at all, and rather colors are perceived as shades of gray, black, and white.

The images above show a screen capture from the Minecraft gameplay environment. Colorblindness simulation filters have been applied to three of the four images to illustrate how various types of color blindness may influence a player's ability to determine the color of game components. Additionally, these examples can show that for a player with deuteranopia, the green grassy background in Minecraft appears similar in color to the red hearts. Overall, various aspects of the game environment are similar in color and can seem to blend in together.

## Hearing and Disability

There are many audio-related game elements that provide crucial information to players. Game elements like the sound of enemy fire, the footsteps of enemy characters approaching, non-player character chatter, and even voice-based communication with other online players are heavily present in games today. For players with varying degrees of hearing loss, certain sounds may be audible, while others can get lost in the mix as they compete with background noises like music or sound effects.

### No Hearing

Similar to vision, hearing is another primary sensory system used in daily tasks. Though you may not see anyone standing at your door, you may hear your doorbell ring, making you aware of visitors. Players with no hearing may be unable to perceive audio affordances provided by games, platforms, and hardware altogether. Audio information and cues like characters speaking, live voice chat among players, in-game sound effects like incoming footsteps or enemy fire, and more must be represented through non-auditory means to support players who cannot hear game audio. Approaches to portray this information through non-auditory means can include visual representations of audio events, captions and subtitles, or haptic rumbles.

During this scene in Gears 5, players may hear the sound of rocks rumbling and the music intensifying to indicate to players that an important event is coming soon. For players who cannot hear, subtitles and captions can represent these auditory cues through visual means, such as text descriptions of the audio events that're occurring, as pictured in this example.

### Partial Hearing

Some players may be able to use audio cues and affordances while gaming, but have difficulty hearing sounds of certain frequencies, volume levels, or sounds coming from certain locations. For example, a player may be able to hear better with their right ear than their left. If their game uses spatial audio, they may be unable to hear audio from the left side of their headset. Additionally, discerning distinct audio cues can be challenging when multiple audio channels are simultaneously competing. If you have ever been in a loud restaurant with music playing, and dozens of people having conversations with one another at surrounding tables, you may have experienced how difficult it can be to hear the conversation happening at your table amidst everything else. In a game, a player may want to lower the background music volume, and effects volumes so they can more easily understand what the other players in the game are saying. Players should be provided the ability to customize various aspects of their audio output to meet their individual preferences.

In Grounded, players can adjust the volume levels for individual classes of audio. For example, a player may wish to mute Music Volume, UI Volume, and Voice Chat volume so it does not interfere with their ability to hear important sound effects.

## Mobility and Disability

Aspects of gameplay like pressing buttons quickly, repeatedly, or for prolonged periods can be challenging depending on a player’s mobility. Similarly, moving mice or joysticks smoothly and with precision to aim a weapon at a target, or jump onto a moving platform can be difficult. Accessible input for gaming experiences must be addressed at both the hardware and software level to create truly accessible experiences for more players.

### Strength

Before gaming experiences can begin, players must be able to operate the input devices they intend to use. For players with disabilities that impact strength, physical actions like pressing a key on a keyboard, moving a mouse, and holding the weight of a standard controller can be difficult. Virtual reality controllers and other motion-based inputs can be especially challenging to use. If players cannot access input devices, they can be gated from play from the very start.

It's important to note that players may be using assistive or adapted input devices that're lighter, easier to move, or take less force to activate. These adaptive gaming set-ups may pose more challenges that players using standing input devices do not encounter. For example, the player in the photo below uses an external joystick mounted underneath his chin to emulate left thumbstick movement. In certain game scenarios that require high precision, such as aiming at a moving target in a first-person shooter, this player may not have the same level of control with his chin as a player using their fingers to game on a standard controller. Software based supports such as the ability to increase or decrease joystick sensitivity, or features like auto-target lock, can provide more accessible experiences for players using non-standard input devices.

### Fine Motor and Manual Dexterity

Picture the task of using a key to lock your front door. As you manipulate the key in your hand to bring it to the correct orientation for the door, insert the key into its slot, and turn your wrist to engage the locking mechanism, you are using a great deal of fine motor movements and manual dexterity. This level of precise movement of the fingers and hands is also required for many standard gaming inputs. Players with difficulty moving their hands and fingers for fine motor tasks may experience challenges when it comes to accessing the buttons on standard input devices quickly and accurately. Game elements like quick time events and simultaneous button presses, or holds can block a player from progressing to the next level of the game.

When designing game experiences, it's also important to think about the number of inputs that your game requires. For example, many first-person shooter games leverage upwards of ten individual controls (shoot, jump, reload, switch weapon, walk, aim, crouch, toggle inventory, etc.). For players who can only access two to four buttons total, can an option to severely reduce the control scheme required to play be provided?

For example, in FIFA, players can enable “two-button mode,” and play the entire match using two buttons.

While these players may not have the full level of control that a ten-input control scheme provides, they can still experience the storyline of the game.

From a hardware development perspective, you want to consider creating input devices that provide flexibility in the size and placement of buttons or joysticks. The [Xbox Adaptive Controller](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller) is a hardware device that allows players to use joysticks, buttons, and other types of input devices that vary in size and force required to activate. For a player with limited fine motor movements who may be unable to hold a standard controller or press the keys on a keyboard, the ability to use joysticks with large handles activated by arm movement eliminates the need to use their thumbs to move the thumb sticks on a standard controller.

### Coordination

The ability to perform smooth, accurate movements of our arms, hands, and fingers are essential in carrying out daily tasks. Without a certain degree of coordination, tasks like bringing a glass of water directly to your mouth without spilling can be difficult. When it comes to gaming experiences, coordination and precision are incredibly important for tasks like aiming at targets or jumping onto moving platforms. Small movements of a thumb stick or mouse can make all the difference when it comes to hitting a target or missing it. It's important that games, platforms, and hardware provide options for players to adjust the sensitivity levels of their input devices or enable supports for game experiences that require precise movements.

In Gears 5, players can enable a feature called Assisted Target Lock which snaps and locks onto enemies when you aim at them. For players with limited coordination, a feature like this can help lessen the number of coordinated movements they must make with their joystick or mouse to hit their target.

On the Xbox platform in the Xbox Accessories App, players can adjust the sensitivity of the thumbsticks on their standard controller.

### Endurance

Our endurance levels dictate how long we can engage in an activity before fatigue. We primarily think of endurance when it comes to athletic activities like running, biking, or swimming. For some players, engaging in gameplay tasks like holding a controller, sitting upright, and repeatedly using muscles in the hand (or other body parts used to activate game controls!), can cause fatigue or pain. Experiences that do not allow players to pause or save their progress at will can introduce barriers. Additionally, common game inputs like quick repetitive button presses, prolonged button presses, introduces fatigue at an increased rate.

In Gears 5, players can change the input requirements for repeated button taps. They can choose to press and hold a button instead, making it less physically demanding for players with limited endurance to repeatedly press a button over a prolonged period of time.

## Cognition and Disability

Despite how fun and engaging games can be, there is a multitude of cognitive work players must be do as they navigate a game that is often subconscious. This "work" often involves constantly processing information from the game to actively problem-solve and make decisions that impact the outcome of their gameplay. However, players with disabilities that affect learning, cognitive processing speeds, attention, and memory, can experience barriers when games do not provide adequate information or tools that help this decision making or problem solving. It's important to provide features and tools that can unblock players who require more time, cues, or other key game information to prevent players from becoming blocked altogether.

### Learning and Cognitive Processing

Imagine the following scenario: you are “stuck” midway through a game’s storyline as  you must place a particular item on an altar in order to unlock the pathway to the next area in the game. Despite revisiting all areas in the game thus far and making numerous attempts to place collected items on the altar, nothing has worked. Ultimately, you search for an online tutorial posted by another player that shows where the correct item for the altar was hidden in a previous game area that you had missed. In this scenario, you were not provided with adequate hints, messaging, or corrective cues from the game to unblock you from proceeding. For players with learning and cognitive disabilities, solving puzzles or completing multi-step tasks can be challenging. Providing options for players to customize the cognitive demands of a game experience through enabling hints, waypoint markers, objective logs, or the ability to bypass these aspects of the game altogether can help ensure that players do not get blocked from progress.

Understanding where to go next in a game often requires learning and cognitive processing to determine what has happened thus far in the game, what is the current objective, and where the location of that objective may be. In the Outer Worlds, players can enable waypoint markers that visually guide players in the direction of their next objective and how far away the location they are traveling to is.

### Attention

Attention can be affected by a wide range of sensory stimuli. While some individuals can easily ignore an incoming text notification on their phone while playing, for others, sustaining attention amidst environmental and in-game distractions can be difficult. Players with disabilities that impact attention may experience barriers when gaming experiences include lots of visual and audio stimuli in the UI. For example, notifications from the game or platform, animated backgrounds behind text, and otherwise loud or busy user interfaces can cause barriers to gameplay.

In the Outer Worlds, players can turn off aspects of the UI they may find distracting in order to keep attention focused on the active gameplay at hand. This player turned off Quest Updates from popping up on screen and plans to lower the Notification Duration to zero, meaning that notifications will not appear for them during play.

### Memory

Memorizing locations, important dates, faces, and more can be challenging given the massive amount of information we perceive daily. Many tasks that seem second-nature such as using a coffee machine or entering the passcode on your garage door require the ability to tap into stored information that has been memorized. Navigating through gaming experiences can also often require the ability to recall memorized information quickly. Tasks like adjusting platform settings can be challenging if controls are not clearly labeled or do not provide context as to how they impact the game experience. Similarly, in-game experiences often require that players have memorized the control scheme, what task they were completing last time they ended gameplay, important locations in the game and more.

In the Outer Worlds, players engage with characters in the game by choosing from a list of response options. The game allows players to view the history log of the current conversation, eliminating the need for players to remember the conversation specifics before choosing their next response.

## Solve for One, Extend to Many

The inclusive design principle “solve for one, extend to many” introduces the premise that intentional design efforts geared toward creating accessible experiences for people with disabilities actually results in universally beneficial features and settings that can be used universally. For example, accessible automatic doors for wheelchair access are also often used by individuals who have their hands full and cannot open the door, or individuals who wish to avoid touching door handles for hygienic reasons. When it comes to game accessibility, it's important to note that options or features intended to facilitate access for a specific group of players can often provide better experiences for all players. For example, while captions and subtitles are intended to make game experiences accessible to players who are deaf or hard of hearing, players who are easily distracted and miss audio cues or players in a loud environment can also benefit from  these features.

The following are examples of bespoke accessibility features and elements benefitting those with temporary or situational disabilities:

- Vision: A person is playing on a small mobile screen outside where there is a lot of sun glare. They are situationally unable to read the text on screen and decide to leverage the high contrast mode provided by the platform.
- Hearing: A person is playing on a loud crowded bus and forgot their headphones. They turn on subtitles and captions because they cannot hear the game audio.
- Mobility: A person is recovering from a hand injury. Their hand muscles fatigue easily after being in a cast for the past few months. They remap the button layout on their controller so buttons normally on the back of the controller like bumpers and triggers are now controlled by buttons on the front of the controller.
- Cognition: A person hasn't played a certain game in a few months but are eager to start playing again. They can't remember where they were at in their last quest. They leverage the quest log, which provides detailed descriptions of what was happening in the game at the time of their last save.
