## Identifying cognitive elements

After players receive information provided by the game, they must then decide how they want to use this information to proceed. These decisions commonly require players to engage in cognitive processes like:

- Maintaining close attention to the cues and information the game provides to ensure no key information is missed.
- Memorizing this information over prolonged periods of time (throughout the course of a mission, or in between play periods).
- Recalling memorized information to assess what the information implies in the context of the task or objective at hand.

These cognitive processes may be more difficult to execute for players with learning, attention, or memory-related disabilities. When accessibility supports and features that address these cognitive demands are not provided, these players can experience unintentional barriers.

In the following video, you'll learn how to identify common cognitive elements that can pose these barriers.






## Cognition and disability

Cognition is another area influenced by a multitude of factors. Primary aspects of cognition include learning or processing information, sustaining attention, and memorizing information provided by games to inform future actions. Players with cognitive disabilities may only experience challenges related to one or two of these components or they may have learning, attention, and memory-related disabilities. Being tired, stressed, or sick can also make it difficult for any player to have difficulty sustaining attention or remembering what their character was last up to.

### Learning and cognitive processing

In gaming, players are often given complex objectives or tasks that they must us their problem-solving skills to navigate. Some of these tasks may be easily understood while other may require additional hints or cues to help the play determine what to do next.

Providing options for players to customize the cognitive demands of a game experience by enabling hints, waypoint markers, objective logs, or the ability to bypass these aspects of the game altogether can help ensure that players do not get blocked from progress.

### Attention

Attention can be impacted by a wide range of sensory stimuli. While some individuals can easily ignore an incoming text notification on their phone while playing, for others, sustaining attention amidst environmental and in-game distractions can be difficult . Players with disabilities that impact attention may experience barriers when gaming experiences include lots of visual and audio stimuli. These stimuli can be notifications from the game or platform, animated backgrounds behind the text, and otherwise “loud” or “busy” user interfaces.

The ability to adjust the length and presence of notifications and background animations is one way in which developers who find these attention-getting mechanisms distracting.

### Memory

Navigating through gaming experiences often requires players to recall past information to inform future decisions. This information can include things like the control scheme for the game, events that happened in the storyline, and important locations in the game and how to get to them. For players who have difficulty remembering information like this, you can take different approaches to provide this information in an accessible way across various aspects of the game.

In general, the ability to reference information like control schemes, objective logs, or area maps at any time can eliminate the need for players to memorize this information.

## Solve for one, extend to many

The inclusive design principle “solve for one, extend to many” introduces the premise that intentional design efforts geared toward creating accessible experiences for people with disabilities result in universally beneficial features and settings. For example, accessible automatic doors for wheelchair access are also often used by the following individuals:

- Those who have their hands full and cannot open the door.
- Those who wish to avoid touching door handles for hygienic reasons.

When it comes to game accessibility, it is important to note that options or features intended to facilitate access for a specific group of players can often provide better experiences for all players. For example, captions and subtitles are intended to make game experiences accessible to players who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing. They may also assist players who are easily distracted and miss audio cues or players in a very loud environment can also benefit from these features.
