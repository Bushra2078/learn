Video games are a staple of modern-day culture. They provide entertainment, connect communities, and foster shared experiences. When accessibility efforts are intentionally included throughout the entire gaming development process, these experiences can be enjoyed by more players.

Consider the following scenario: You've recently joined a development team and are looking to create experiences that are as accessible as possible for more players. While accessibility is important to you, you have little experience in the game accessibility space and are unsure whereto start. You're looking for an approachable way to establish your foundational knowledge of accessible game, platform, and hardware development.

Specifically, the foundational knowledge needed to do so include an understanding of:

- How to approach gameplay and development through the lens of accessibility
- How common design elements can introduce inaccessible experiences for players
- How gameplay experiences differ among players with both different, and similar disabilities

In this module, you’ll be introduced to these foundational concepts about game accessibility. Specifically, this module address game accessibility in the context of visual, audio, cognitive, and input-based experiences.

> [!NOTE]
> While vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility-based elements are addressed in this introductory module, it’s important to note that there are many other game
elements that impact accessibility.
>
> This includes elements related to:
>
> - Speech and communication
> - Sensory demands
> - Mental health and more
>
> Additional information about these player experiences can be found in the summary and resources unit of this module.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 - Discuss the relationship between gaming and visual, audio, cognitive, and input-based game experiences.
 - Identify common visual, hearing, cognitive, and input-based elements within gaming experiences that can introduce unintentional barriers for players.
 - Describe the concept of diverse player experiences and the importance of considering these diverse experiences when learning about gaming accessibility foundations.
