Video games are a staple of modern-day culture. They provide entertainment, connect communities, and foster shared experiences. When accessibility is included throughout the development entire process, gaming experiences can be enjoyed by more players.

Consider the following scenario: Your team is developing a new game title. They want to ensure that as many players as possible can enjoy it. The goal is to create a multiplayer combat game with puzzle-based elements, rich visuals, and audio. The team is new to the accessibility space and are not sure where to begin.

Specifically, they’re unsure of things like:

- How to understand gameplay through the lens of accessibility
- How common design elements can introduce inaccessible experiences
- How gameplay experiences differ for players with different types of disabilities

In this module, you’ll be introduced to foundational concepts about game accessibility. Specifically, you’ll learn about common game elements and mechanics that can pose unintentional barriers for players with disabilities.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

1. Discuss the relationship between gaming and visual, audio, cognitive, and input-based game experiences.
2. Identify common visual, hearing, cognitive, and input-based elements within gaming experiences that can introduce unintentional barriers for players.
3. Describe the concept of diverse player experiences and the importance of considering these diverse experiences when learning about gaming accessibility foundations.
