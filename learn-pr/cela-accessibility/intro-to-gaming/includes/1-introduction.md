Video games are a staple of modern-day culture. They provide entertainment, connect communities, and foster shared experiences. When accessibility efforts are intentionally included throughout the entire gaming development process, these experiences can be enjoyed by more players.

Consider the following scenario: A new development team is looking to create experiences that are as accessible as possible for more players. While accessibility is an established core priority, they have little experience in the game accessibility space and are unsure where to start. They're looking for an approachable way to establish a foundational knowledge of accessible game, platform, and hardware development.

Specifically, the team is looking for a foundational understanding of the following concepts:

- How to approach game play and development through the lens of accessibility
- What unintentional barriers to access are, and how common game elements can introduce these barriers to players
- How game play experiences can vastly differ among players with different and similar disabilities

As a developer also new to gaming accessibility, if this story resonates with your own personal goals, the following module is a great place to start.

 In this module, you’ll be introduced to foundational concepts about game accessibility. Specifically, this module will focus on vision, audio, cognition, and input-related aspects of game accessibility to build your foundational knowledge.

> [!NOTE]
> While vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility-based elements are addressed in this introductory module, it’s important to note that there are many other game
elements that impact accessibility.
>
> This includes elements related to:
>
> - Speech and communication
> - Sensory demands
> - Mental health and more
>
> Additional information about these player experiences can be found in the summary and resources unit of this module.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 - Discuss the relationship between vision, audio, cognition, and input and gaming.
 - Identify common visual, hearing, cognitive, and input-based elements within gaming experiences that can introduce unintentional barriers for players.
 - Describe the concept of diverse player experiences and the importance of considering these diverse experiences when learning about gaming accessibility foundations.
