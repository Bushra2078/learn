You've learned about the portray of important game information through visual means, and how players can become blocked from game progress if this visual information is not accessible. 

In this unit, you'll learn about the relationship between audio and gaming, and the unintentional barriers inaccessible audio elements can introduce to players with disabilities.

## Audio and gaming

Similar to visual elements, gaming experiences also use audio-based elements to portray information needed to navigate the experience. When this audio-based information is not represented in an accessible way, players with hearing-related disabilities may be excluded from using this information.

In the following video, you'll learn more about the relationship between audio and game experiences. You'll also learn how to identify common audio-based elements that can pose unintentional barriers for players.

## Hearing and disability

When exploring audio accessibility, itâ€™s important to understand that the experiences of players with hearing-related disabilities can also largely differ when playing games. Players who cannot hear any audio provided by a game, platform, or hardware device will encounter very different experiences than players who may have varying levels of hearing that can differ in each ear, or differ based on the frequency or volume of sounds presented.

A foundational awareness of these differences warrant the need to consult with a wide array of players with hearing-disabilities to inform effective solutions that address each of these unique experiences.

### Gaming without audio

Players who cannot hear any game audio must typically determine their next steps based on visual and haptic cues alone. These players may miss important game information when it is portrayed through audio alone. For example, live voice among players, in-game sound effects like nearby footsteps or enemy fire, and non-player character dialogue cannot be used to inform the game play of these players.

General approaches to support these players could include:

- An option to enable subtitles and captions for all important character dialogue
- Representing audio cues like enemy footsteps through visual cues within the UI or within captions
- Supporting accessible player-to-player communication tools like text-to-speech chat and speech-to-text chat.

### Gaming and partial hearing

Players with hearing disabilities may have difficulty hearing sounds of certain frequencies, volume levels, or sounds coming from certain locations. Many game experiences provide multiple sounds simultaneously. For example, there may be areas of a game where background music, character dialogue, effects noises, and live player chat are all actively producing sound. This can make it difficult to clearly hear the sound channels that are most important to game play.

Approaches that should be considered for players with partial hearing could include:

- The ability to adjust the volume levels for individual classes of audio (player chat, music, effects, UI, dialogue, and voice chat).  
- The option to enable mono audio output.
