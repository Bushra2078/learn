This is an introduction to audio accessibility

## Identifying audio elements

Like visual elements, gaming experiences also use audio-based elements to portray information needed to navigate the experience. When this audio based information is not represented in an accessible way, players with hearing-related disabilities may be excluded from using this information.

In the following video, you'll learn how to identify common audio-based elements that can pose unintentional barriers for players.

It's important to identify areas where audio plays a key role in gameplay. This is an important first step to ensure that the following players can customize their experience to meet their needs and preferences.

## Hearing and disability

When exploring audio accessibility, itâ€™s important to understand that the experiences of players with hearing-related disabilities can also largely differ when playing games. Players may not be able to hear any audio provided by a game, platform, or hardware device. Other players may have varying levels of hearing that can differ in each ear or differ based on the frequency or volume of sounds presented.

### Gaming without audio

Players who cannot hear any game audio must determine their next steps based on visual and haptic cues alone. These players can miss important game information when it is portrayed through audio alone. For example, live voice among players, in-game sound effects such nearby footsteps or enemy fire, and non-player character dialogue cannot be used to inform the gameplay of these players.

Approaches to support these players would include:

- An option to enable subtitles and captions for all important character dialogue
- Representing audio cues like enemy footsteps through visual cues within the UI or within captions
- Supporting accessible player communication settings like text-to-speech and speech-to-text.

### Gaming and partial hearing

Players with hearing disabilities may have difficulty hearing sounds of certain frequencies, volume levels, or sounds coming from certain locations. Many game experiences provide multiple sounds simultaneously. For example, there may be areas of a game where background music, character dialogue, effects noises, and live player chat are all actively producing sound. This can make it difficult to clearly hear the sound channels that are most important to gameplay.

Approaches that should be considered for players with partial hearing would include supports like:

- The ability to adjust the volume levels for individual class of audio (player chat, music, effects, UI, dialogue, and voice chat).  
- The option to enable mono audio output.
