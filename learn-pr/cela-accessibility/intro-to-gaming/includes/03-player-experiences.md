In the previous unit, you learned about foundational concepts like accessibility barriers and how they are commonly introduced. This unit will build upon those concepts in further detail. Specifically, you'll learn how player experiences can largely differ, even among players with similar types of visual, hearing, cognitive, and mobility disabilities.

These differences warrant the need for targeted solutions that eliminate barriers for a wide range of player experiences. For example, a game that provides a text-scaling option can eliminate barriers to access for some players with low vision. However, this feature alone does not mean that the game is fully accessible to players with other types of low vision, players who are colorblind, or players without sight.

Accessible design is not a one-size-fits-all solution. This unit provides a basic overview of these differences to ultimately broaden your understanding of gaming accessibility as a process that cannot be solved through a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Vision and disability

Visual disabilities can impact player experiences across a wide spectrum. Players may experience any combination of the following:

Player experiences can be impacted by visual disabilities across a wide spectrum. The way players perceive visual information while gaming can include:

- A complete lack of sight or ability to see game visuals
- Varying degrees of blurriness
- An incomplete view, or missing portions of their screen or UI
- Difficulty distinguishing colors within the UI
- Impacted depth perception and more

A general awareness of these differences is an important first step in providing solutions that support a broad range of players.

### Gaming without vision

Your future customers will likely include players who cannot see any aspect of their screen or gaming device. These players must interpret all information from a game through audio or haptic channels alone. This means that common visual accessibility settings like adjusting text size or contrast will not be helpful for these players.

You’re encouraged to think about how all visual information in a game can be represented entirely through non-visual means. Examples of this include:

- Ensure all text-based elements (in menus, heads-up display, and text-based player chat) can be read aloud via screen narration.
- Represent environmental cues such as the location of a nearby exit door, interactable object, or enemy character through spatial audio.

### Gaming and low vision

Low vision is a broad term that can encompass a wide spectrum of visual abilities. Players with low vision may have a cloudier, blurrier, or less complete view of what is on their game screen.

> [!NOTE]
> The extent of cloudiness, blurriness, or completeness of view can widely vary from player to player. This is why providing multiple options for customization is important.

Players with low vision can experience difficulty reading text or seeing on-screen visual elements. To ensure gameplay experiences are accessible for players with varying degrees of low vision, you should consider providing players with customization options for the following:

- The size of text in menus, within the game environment, and within chat-based player-to-player communications.
- The size of visual elements like waypoint markers, cross hairs, and other important visual indicators.
- The color and contrast of text and visual elements by enabling solid backgrounds against them and providing choice of color for the element and its background color.
- The location that visual elements like chat boxes, notifications, HUD displays, and more appear on screen.

## Hearing and disability

When exploring audio accessibility, it’s important to understand that the experiences of players with hearing-related disabilities can also largely differ when playing games. Players may not be able to hear any audio provided by a game, platform, or hardware device. Other players may have varying levels of hearing that can differ in each ear or differ based on the frequency or volume of sounds presented.

### Gaming without audio

Players who cannot hear any game audio must determine their next steps based on visual and haptic cues alone. These players can miss important game information when it is portrayed through audio alone. For example, live voice among players, in-game sound effects such nearby footsteps or enemy fire, and non-player character dialogue cannot be used to inform the gameplay of these players.

Approaches to support these players would include:

- An option to enable subtitles and captions for all important character dialogue
- Representing audio cues like enemy footsteps through visual cues within the UI or within captions
- Supporting accessible player communication settings like text-to-speech and speech-to-text.

### Gaming and partial hearing

Players with hearing disabilities may have difficulty hearing sounds of certain frequencies, volume levels, or sounds coming from certain locations. Many game experiences provide multiple sounds simultaneously. For example, there may be areas of a game where background music, character dialogue, effects noises, and live player chat are all actively producing sound. This can make it difficult to clearly hear the sound channels that are most important to gameplay.

Approaches that should be considered for players with partial hearing would include supports like:

- The ability to adjust the volume levels for individual class of audio (player chat, music, effects, UI, dialogue, and voice chat).  
- The option to enable mono audio output.

## Mobility and disability

Players with disabilities that impact arm and hand movement can also experience unique barriers to play. The experiences of these players can differ based on the nature of physical demands a game requires for input. When learning about the broad range of player experiences related to mobility and input, an awareness of the following factors is an important start:

- The strength required to activate inputs
- The dexterity required to perform complex input patterns
- The coordination required to accurately control analog inputs
- The endurance required to engage in gameplay until a pause, save, or stopping point that saves progress can be reached  

Mobility-related disabilities can impact any combination of a player’s strength, dexterity, coordination, and endurance. Some players may be able to activate buttons for prolonged periods with ease but lack the coordination needed to accurately aim at moving targets. Others may experience difficulties related to all four of these categories. The following information will discuss the unique barriers and corresponding support approaches to be aware of as you learn more about the gaming accessibility space.

### Strength and gaming

Players must be able to operate the input devices that are supported by their desired platforms and games. For players with disabilities that impact strength, physical actions like pressing a key on a keyboard, moving a mouse, or holding the weight of a standard controller during play can be difficult.

As a result, these players may often avoid the use of standard devices like mice, keyboards, and controllers altogether. Instead, players may use assistive technology devices. in place of standard input devices. These devices typically include buttons and analog controls that require less force to activate than standard devices. They can also support the use of larger buttons that can be activated by the head, foot, elbow, or other larger body parts

When approaching accessible input solutions, the following settings and supports should be considered:

- Support a broad range of input devices. Many accessible gaming inputs support keyboard and mouse input. For example, a device may physically look like a joystick, but is recognized as a mouse by the game’s software. If a game or platform does not support mouse input, a player who requires this device may be excluded from play.  
- Provide players an option to adjust joystick sensitivity in-game and at the platform level.

### Dexterity and gaming

Dexterity in the context of gaming refers to the rapid movement of a player’s fingers to activate controls within a specific time frame. For example, a game that requires players to activate a series of four different buttons consecutively to perform an attack can pose significant barriers to players with limited dexterity.

You can support players with specific dexterity and fine motor considerations by providing options that:

- Decrease the number of inputs needed to successfully play a game
- Allow players to remap all controls in a game
- Allow players to disable or skip quick-time-events (QTEs)
- Do not require holding down multiple buttons simultaneously

### Coordination and gaming

The ability to perform smooth, accurate movements  of our arms, hands, and fingers is incredibly important in gaming experiences. Common mechanics like jumping onto moving platforms or aiming at targets can require very precise movements of a thumb stick or mouse. Performing these movements with accuracy can make all the difference when it comes to hitting or missing a target.

Supports that decrease coordination demands, like assistive target-lock settings, can help support these players.

### Endurance

Endurance typically refers to how long someone can engage in an activity before becoming tired. For some players, engaging in gameplay tasks like holding a controller or repeatedly using muscles in the hand (or other body parts used to activate game controls), can cause fatigue or pain after short periods.

Common game mechanics that tend to introduce fatigue more readily include input demands like quick, repetitive button presses and holding buttons for prolonged periods. Approaches to support these players include providing players with the ability to:

- Change input demands from button holds to button presses
- Allow players to pause a game or initiate game saves at any point in time
- Provide toggle-based settings like auto-fire, auto-run, and more

## Cognition and disability

Cognition is another area influenced by a multitude of factors. Primary aspects of cognition include learning or processing information, sustaining attention, and memorizing information provided by games to inform future actions. Players with cognitive disabilities may only experience challenges related to one or two of these components or they may have learning, attention, and memory-related disabilities. Being tired, stressed, or sick can also make it difficult for any player to have difficulty sustaining attention or remembering what their character was last up to.

### Learning and cognitive processing

In gaming, players are often given complex objectives or tasks that they must us their problem-solving skills to navigate. Some of these tasks may be easily understood while other may require additional hints or cues to help the play determine what to do next.

Providing options for players to customize the cognitive demands of a game experience by enabling hints, waypoint markers, objective logs, or the ability to bypass these aspects of the game altogether can help ensure that players do not get blocked from progress.

### Attention

Attention can be impacted by a wide range of sensory stimuli. While some individuals can easily ignore an incoming text notification on their phone while playing, for others, sustaining attention amidst environmental and in-game distractions can be difficult . Players with disabilities that impact attention may experience barriers when gaming experiences include lots of visual and audio stimuli. These stimuli can be notifications from the game or platform, animated backgrounds behind the text, and otherwise “loud” or “busy” user interfaces.

The ability to adjust the length and presence of notifications and background animations is one way in which developers who find these attention-getting mechanisms distracting.

### Memory

Navigating through gaming experiences often requires players to recall past information to inform future decisions. This information can include things like the control scheme for the game, events that happened in the storyline, and important locations in the game and how to get to them. For players who have difficulty remembering information like this, you can take different approaches to provide this information in an accessible way across various aspects of the game.

In general, the ability to reference information like control schemes, objective logs, or area maps at any time can eliminate the need for players to memorize this information.

## Solve for one, extend to many

The inclusive design principle “solve for one, extend to many” introduces the premise that intentional design efforts geared toward creating accessible experiences for people with disabilities result in universally beneficial features and settings. For example, accessible automatic doors for wheelchair access are also often used by the following individuals:

- Those who have their hands full and cannot open the door.
- Those who wish to avoid touching door handles for hygienic reasons.

When it comes to game accessibility, it is important to note that options or features intended to facilitate access for a specific group of players can often provide better experiences for all players. For example, captions and subtitles are intended to make game experiences accessible to players who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing. They may also assist players who are easily distracted and miss audio cues or players in a very loud environment can also benefit from these features.
