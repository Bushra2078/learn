  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options is most likely to introduce input barriers?"
    choices:
    - content: "A game has a large, distracting animation behind the main menu."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A distracting animation behind a menu may introduce a cognitive barrier, not an input barrier."
    - content: "A game has players move their character by holding down a thumb stick in the direction they wish to go."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By forcing individuals to hold the stick down in the direction they wish to move, they may introduce a barrier for players who do not have the physical strength to keep the stick held down for more than a moment."
    - content: "A game requires a player to hold down the right stick button to crouch or enable an option to toggle crouching."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By providing an option to toggle crouching instead of holding down a button, an input barrier is avoided."
  - content: "A game requires a player to mash the “A” button to shoot rapidly. What aspect of mobility would NOT impact such a game mechanic?"
    choices:
    - content: "Endurance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Endurance refers to how long someone can engage in an activity before becoming tired. The ability to repeatedly press the same button can be impacted by an individual’s level of endurance."
    - content: "Dexterity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Dexterity refers to the rapid movement of a player’s fingers to activate controls within a specific time frame. The ability to repeatedly press the same button can be impacted by an individual’s dexterity."
    - content: "Coordination"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Coordination refers to the ability to perform smooth, accurate movements. While moving the character might require coordination, the act of mashing a button repeatedly to fire does not require smooth or accurate movements."
