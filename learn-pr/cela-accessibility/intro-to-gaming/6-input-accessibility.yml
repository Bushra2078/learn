  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options is most likely to introduce barriers related to game input?"
    choices:
    - content: "A game has a large, distracting animation behind the main menu."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A distracting animation behind a menu may introduce a cognitive barrier, not an input barrier."
    - content: "A game has players move their character by holding down a thumb stick in the direction they wish to go."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By forcing individuals to hold the stick down in the direction they wish to move, they may introduce a barrier for players who do not have the physical strength to keep the stick held down for more than a moment."
    - content: "A game requires a player to hold down the right stick button to crouch or enable an option to toggle crouching."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By providing an option to toggle crouching instead of holding down a button, an input barrier is avoided."
  - content: "Which of the following options is most likely to support a player who has difficulty performing smooth, accurate movements with a thumb stick?"
    choices:
    - content: "An option to turn on an auto-target-lock feature which only requires the player to move their aiming crosshair relatively close to their target once. After that, their crosshair remains locked to the target until they shoot."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Aiming at moving targets requires a great deal of precision and accuracy. An option that lessens these demands by locking on to a target after a player is relatively close to it once can support players who have difficulty with these types of tasks."
    - content: "An option to convert button taps to button holds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An option like this may assist a player with limited endurance or speed. However, it would not decrease the precision demands needed to successfully aim at a moving target."
    - content: "An option to turn on auto-shoot, so the player's weapon is always firing even when they are not pressing their fire button"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An option like this may assist a player with limited endurance who cannot hold the sprint button for prolonged periods. This option, however, would not reduce the coordination demands of aiming at a moving target."
