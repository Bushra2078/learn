  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Why is it important to consider accessible design approaches for standard hardware devices like consoles, PCs, and headsets?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ensure that all standard gaming devices are as accessible as bespoke accessibility devices and assistive technologies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ideally, all devices would be fully accessible to all players. However, diverse player needs often warrant specific design considerations that address these needs. It may not be possible for every standard gaming device, therefore, standard devices should at least include the accessible elements needed for users to complete initial set-up, and connect their bespoke accessibility devices for in-game play."
    - content: "Standard hardware devices often need to be used before a player can use their specific assistive technologies or adaptive input devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Even though a player may have a customized input device for gameplay, if they cannot power on their platform device, they cannot use their customized controllers."
    - content: "It is not necessary to ensure that standard hardware devices are accessible if an accessible version of the same device already exists."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Though many standard hardware devices such as the standard Xbox controller have an accessible counterpart (the Xbox Adaptive Controller), it doesn't mean that all players need the same level of customization and flexibility that a product like the Xbox Adaptive Controller offers. Instead, all hardware devices should provide a baseline level of accessible elements when possible to provide better experiences for more players."
