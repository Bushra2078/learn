The player from our introductory scenario was eager to use their new console to play games with friends and family. Despite owning an adaptive controller, interacting with standard hardware devices, in this case the  new console, cannot be avoided.

While standard hardware devices may not provide the same accessibility supports as bespoke accessibility products, a multitude of best practices can be implemented when designing all gaming hardware devices to support more players. This unit will outline the importance of accessibility in hardware development.

## What is the role of accessibility in standard hardware development?

Access to gaming hardware like consoles, controllers, PCs, mice, keyboards, and headsets is an instrumental preliminary step in enjoying the gameplay. Unlike gaming software, hardware devices are typically not as flexible or customizable to the wide range of player needs. It's important to note the difference between hardware devices purposefully designed and created to provide an accessible experience for players, such as the Xbox Adaptive Controller, and standard devices that all players must use to access game platforms and titles.

The Xbox Adaptive Controller is a device created with and for players with disabilities. The device features large buttons that are easily activated and multiple standard hardware connections including 3.5 mm jacks and USB-C ports. It provides users with robust customization options from both a hardware and software perspective.

There are many similar hardware products that are intentionally built with accessibility at the forefront of development. These devices, typically referred to as “assistive technologies” may offer:

- Larger or “oversized” components
- Joysticks and buttons that can be activated with low force
- Options to customize many aspects to distinct user needs

For “non-adaptive” or standard devices, it can be difficult to offer the same ease of use and customization options. Limitations around device size and ease of use for the general population can contribute to these difficulties. When designing for the masses, prioritization is generally around form factors that are small, compact, and sleek.

For reference, the following image shows the difference in size between the Xbox Adaptive Controller, a standard Xbox controller, and two accessibility switch buttons.

However, it's important to remember that standard gaming devices like consoles, PCs, and headsets commonly act as the “gatekeeper” to beginning any form of gameplay. If a player cannot connect their console to their tv and power it on, they are blocked from using their adaptive controller for in-game play.

It might not be possible to meet the needs of all players with a single, standard hardware device. However, there are some general best practices for hardware accessibility that are applicable to all devices. These best practices will be described in detail throughout the remainder of this module. Implementing these practices during hardware development can provide more accessible experiences for players as they perform basic set-up and operation tasks needed to play.
