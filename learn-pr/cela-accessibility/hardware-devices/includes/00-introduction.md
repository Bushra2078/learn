Before starting a game, players typically perform physical set-up tasks like pressing power buttons, connecting cords, and more. When these physical aspects of gaming hardware are inaccessible, players may be excluded from play before setting up or turning on  their devices.

Consider the following scenario: A player with a disability that impacts their dexterity and finger strength has recently purchased a new gaming console. The unboxing experience introduces many challenges. Removing adhesives and fasteners found on packaging components is beyond their level of strength and dexterity. They turn to their caregiver for assistance  , the excitement of unboxing the device dampened.

Once all components are free  from the packaging, they continue to experience accessibility barriers during the hardware set-up process. Tasks like manipulating connection cords to insert them into corresponding ports on their TV and console with proper orientation is challenging. Important console components such as the power and Bluetooth pairing buttons are also small and difficult to press. The player is frustrated by how difficult it is to set up and configure the gaming hardware, and they are discouraged they are not able to start their gaming experience immediately.

As a developer in the gaming space, you’re eager to learn about the holistic experience of players with disabilities and to ensure the end-to-end experience of gaming is accessible for as many players as possible.

In this module, you’ll learn about the role of accessible design in standard gaming hardware development, accessibility best practice guidelines to consider for hardware component operation and discoverability, and accessibility best practice guidelines to consider when developing hardware packaging components.

By the end of this module, you will be able to identify accessibility best practice guidelines for hardware components, hardware labels and status indicators, and packaging.

After completing this module, you’ll be able to demonstrate an understanding of the role that accessibility plays in standard hardware development compared to adaptive and assistive technologies, employ accessibility best practices during gaming hardware development, and employ accessibility best practices during hardware packaging development.
