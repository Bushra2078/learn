Before gameplay truly begins, players must typically perform physical hardware set-up tasks including: 
- Unboxing their new device
- Connecting wires and cords into device ports
- Locating and physically activating device components like wireless pairing and power buttons

Consider the following scenario: A player with limited hand strength purchased a new accessible controller and gaming console. Excited to play, they begin unboxing. Shortly after they experience difficulty removing the strong adhesives on the packaging. Ultimately turning to their caregiver to complete the "unboxing" experience, their excitement fades.

They also experience barriers while setting up their console. Despite owning an accessible controller, they first have to activate the power and wireless pairing buttons on their console. Unfortunately, those console buttons are small and too difficult for the player to press. This player is blocked from using their accessible controller in gameplay altogether. You hear of this situation and are eager to learn how standard gaming hardware devices can be made more accessible.

In this module, you’ll learn about the role of accessibility in standard hardware development. You'll be introduced to accessibility best practice guidance for creating more accessible standard hardware devices and product packaging.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Discuss the role of accessibility in standard hardware design as compared to assistive technology design.
- Employ best practices during gaming hardware development.
- Employ best practices during hardware packaging design.
