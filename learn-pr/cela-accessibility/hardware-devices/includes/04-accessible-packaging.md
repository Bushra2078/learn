Unboxing a new gaming device is a process that can be invigorating and rewarding to players, bringing waves of joy and excitement as they prepare to play. Packaging is designed  to protect the device and combine multiple components into one container. Packaging is also often designed to market the device by providing a “premium” look and feel to the product prior to purchase or unboxing.  Successful packaging experiences are those that provide easy wayfinding of parts, easy removal of parts, product protection with minimal materials, and providing quick and concise ways to get started with the product.

The protective and premium nature of these packaging components can often pose difficulties for players with disabilities as described in the introductory scenario. In that scenario, the player was able to obtain caregiver assistance, but not all players have available resources who can help. These players may be prevented from play altogether if they are unable to safely open a box and remove their device and its components.

In this unit, you will learn best practices for accessible product packaging design.

## Provide accessible cues to inform proper unboxing orientation

Before opening a boxed device, determining the proper orientation of the box is an important first step. If you have just bought a laptop or console, opening the box upside down can result in the device dropping to the floor and becoming damaged. A player may look for visual cues on the packaging to determine proper orientation. Visual cues like text or imagery placed on the box for instructional or aesthetic purposes can typically inform proper orientation.

If a player has low or no vision or cannot understand the meaning of external imagery to inform proper opening orientation, they may attempt to open the package incorrectly. To create a safer, more accessible experience consider the following best practices:

- Design packaging with discernable tactile  cues that inform proper opening orientation. This can be done successfully with graphics, break the seal labels or closure tabs, and/or seam lines
- Create packaging that allows players to open and remove devices safely, regardless of box orientation

## Support accessible removal of adhesives and fasteners

Players with disabilities may struggle to remove adhesives used to keep packaging components together. Players with mobility disabilities can have trouble peeling or removing the tape that seals packaging. Removing tape requires fine motor coordination to lift and grasp the edge of the tape and strength to pull it from the packaging. Players may resort to using a sharp objective to open the package which may damage the device or result in personal injury. The following are adhesive best practices to consider when creating an accessible unboxing experience:

- Ensure adhesives are discoverable through visual and tactile means
- Provide leverage points for adhesive removal, such as a protruding pull tab
- Don’t apply adhesives on components that do not need them

The Xbox Adaptive Controller Accessible Packaging Video located later in this unit contains examples of these best practices in action.

## Provide multiple access points to inner packaging components

Once the device is revealed, players are tasked with removing the device and its smaller accompanying components like chargers and instructional guides from within the inner packaging containers. These components can be packed tightly into Styrofoams, plastic bags, or other materials to protect them and keep them from moving around in the box.

Players with disabilities that cause weakness or reduced dexterity may find it challenging to extract the component from its containing material. With the balance of device security and accessibility in mind, what follows are best practices for component removal to consider when creating accessible packaging experiences for players with disabilities:

Provide physical access points to assist players in removing devices from inner packaging. For example, the pull tab on the plastic wrap that protrudes outward from the surface tablet package.

Provide physical access points such as pull tabs or loops to assist players in removing smaller boxes or device components from inner packaging structures. The image below reveals the underlying packaging components that are visible once the surface tablet is removed.

Though these components are embedded within the surrounding container, note the following design elements that support a more accessible removal experience:

The envelope containing the device’s quick-start guide and the box containing the charging block feature an oval-shaped opening. This opening allows users to grasp and remove these components by inserting their fingers into the negative cavity space.

From here, the process of removing the charging block  from its box has also been designed with accessibility in mind. The charging block is placed on a tray within the box that can be easily slid out. This eliminates the need to shake and lift the box or pull on the power block to remove it.

The tray has a large oval -shaped loop that protrudes from the box, even when closed. This provides users an easy access point to grasp and slide the tray, revealing the power block. The smaller box  can be removed by using the loop to slide the tray out of the box.

For heavier devices or hardware components that may cause pull tabs or loops to tear, design packaging so that negative spaces or “cavities” are present around the device. These cavities allow players to grasp the device for removal.

The images below show the packaging for the Xbox Series X. The surrounding materials keep the console from moving within the box, and large open spaces surrounding the device provide locations where players can insert their fingers or hands for removal.

## Review best practices in action

The video below features many of the best practices outlined in this unit in action. It discusses the accessible packaging components designed and implemented for the Xbox Adaptive Controller. This product and its packaging exemplify a “gold standard”  of accessible design. The intent of this video is to reinforce best practice informed presented in this unit and to provide inspiration for future packaging design efforts.

Devices differ in terms of size, weight, fragility, and cost. These variables may introduce challenges when designing and creating accessible packaging. Identifying and implementing solutions for these challenges can help improve customer satisfaction, and help to provide customers with disabilities a truly delightful experience from the moment they have their device at home.
