Unboxing a new gaming device after purchase is often considered a treasured experience among many. Product packaging is designed to both protect and market the device prior to purchase. These efforts to ensure maximum device protection while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing design can often result in packaging elements that are difficult or impossible to remove for some players.

In this unit, you'll be introduced to best practice principles for packaging design that can produce more accessible customer experiences through:

- Easy wayfinding of packaging components like adhesives and access points
- Easy removal of device parts from the packaging
- Product protection with minimal materials

## Provide accessible cues to inform proper unboxing orientation

Before opening a boxed device, determining the proper orientation of the box is an important first step. If you have just bought a laptop or console, opening the box upside down can result in the device dropping to the floor and becoming damaged.

Players may look for visual cues like text or imagery on the box to inform proper orientation. An example of this can be found in the following image of the Surface Adaptive Kit packaging.

:::image type="content" source="../media/adaptive-kit-box.png" alt-text="The packaging for the Surface Adaptive Kit. The box contains text and images on the top panel.":::

The top panel of the packaging has text and an image of the Surface Adaptive Kit components. When the box is properly oriented for opening, this text and image appears "right-side-up" to the user. If the user were to orient the box differently, the text and image would appear upside-down or sideways. This would indicate to the user that should adjust the box orientation prior to opening.

Players who can't see or use these visual cues to guide correct orientation may accidentally open packaging incorrectly, resulting in dropped or damaged new devices. To create a safer, more accessible experience, consider the following best practices:

- Design packaging with accessible visual and structural cues that inform proper opening orientation.
    - Visual: Provide larger text and graphics on packaging to ensure more players with low vision can see and use it to guide orientation.
    - Structural: Offer discoverable tactile cues that inform proper unboxing orientation through intentional placement such as break the seal labels, closure tabs, or seam lines.
- Create packaging that allows players to open and remove devices safely, regardless of box orientation.

## Support accessible removal of adhesives and fasteners

Strong adhesives that seal packaging can often pose challenges for players as they attempt to peel or remove them. Removing adhesives requires a great deal of hand and finger strength to lift and grasp the end of the adhesive, and pull it away from the packaging.

Players may resort to using a sharp objects to open the package which may damage the device or result in personal injury. The following are adhesive best practices to consider when creating an accessible unboxing experience:

- Ensure adhesives are discoverable through visual and tactile means
- Provide leverage points for adhesive removal, such as a protruding pull tab
- Don’t apply adhesives on components that do not need them

In the following image of the Xbox Adaptive Controller packaging, a large adhesive sticker seals the box. This adhesive features two smaller circular loops to serve as an access point for users as they grasp the adhesive to remove it.

## Provide multiple access points to inner packaging components

Once the device is revealed, players are tasked with removing the device and its smaller accompanying components. Smaller components like chargers and instructional guides are typically packed tightly into Styrofoams, plastic bags, or other materials used to protect and secure them from moving around in the box.

Removing these types of components can also pose accessibility challenges given the strength and dexterity required to grasp these objects. With the balance of device security and accessibility in mind, what follows are best practices for component removal to consider when creating accessible packaging experiences for players with disabilities:

- Provide physical access points to assist players in removing devices from inner packaging. For example, the pull tab on the plastic wrap that protrudes outward from the surface tablet package.

- Provide physical access points such as pull tabs or loops to assist players in removing smaller boxes or device components from inner packaging structures. The image below reveals the underlying packaging components that are visible once the surface tablet is removed.

Though these components are embedded within the surrounding container, note the following design elements that support a more accessible removal experience:

The envelope containing the device’s quick-start guide and the box containing the charging block feature an oval-shaped opening. This opening allows users to grasp and remove these components by inserting their fingers into the negative cavity space.

:::image type="content" source="../media/microsoft-teams-1.png" alt-text="The box for a Microsoft Service device. It is empty and a documentation envelope in the box is visible.":::

From here, the process of removing the charging block  from its box has also been designed with accessibility in mind. The charging block is placed on a tray within the box that can be easily slid out. This eliminates the need to shake and lift the box or pull on the power block to remove it.

The tray has a large oval -shaped loop that protrudes from the box, even when closed. This provides users an easy access point to grasp and slide the tray, revealing the power block. The smaller box  can be removed by using the loop to slide the tray out of the box.

For heavier devices or hardware components that may cause pull tabs or loops to tear, design packaging so that negative spaces or “cavities” are present around the device. These cavities allow players to grasp the device for removal.

The images below show the packaging for the Xbox Series X. The surrounding materials keep the console from moving within the box, and large open spaces surrounding the device provide locations where players can insert their fingers or hands for removal.

## Review best practices in action

The following video features many of the best practices outlined in this unit in action. It discusses the accessible packaging components designed and implemented for the Xbox Adaptive Controller. This product and its packaging exemplify a “gold standard”  of accessible design. The intent of this video is to reinforce best practice informed presented in this unit and to provide inspiration for future packaging design efforts.

Devices differ in terms of size, weight, fragility, and cost. These variables may introduce challenges when designing and creating accessible packaging. Identifying and implementing solutions for these challenges can help improve customer satisfaction, and help to provide more customers a truly delightful experience from the moment they have their device at home.
