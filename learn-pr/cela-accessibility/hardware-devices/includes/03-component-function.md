You previously learned about a player who faced accessibility barriers related to physical unboxing and hardware set-up. However, there are many other areas of accessibility to consider.

In this unit, you'll learn about potential barriers that inaccessible hardware experiences can pose for players with visual disabilities. You'll be introduced to best practices that can improve accessible experiences for these players as they navigate the following types of tasks:

- Locating the ports and buttons on the console
- Identifying the functions of each port and button
- Identifying the correct cable and inserting it into the proper port

## Support component discoverability and identification

The visual presence of buttons, ports, and labels on devices are important in guiding successful interactions. For example, a player would like to mute the volume on their gaming headset. However, their headset has multiple buttons that are the same shape and size. Luckily, each button is labeled with power and mic mute symbols. The player uses this visual information to successfully differentiate the mute button from the others.

Consider how this experience may differ for a player who cannot see these labels to inform their actions. They may accidentally press the power button and turn off their device instead of muting it, resulting in a negative experience.

The following video discusses these considerations and how to address them through accessible supports in further detail:

## Indicate device status through multiple sensory channels

The current status of a device is another important piece of information that guides successful interactions. Device status informs a player of critical information including the device's:  

 - Current power state (on or off)
 - Current battery level
 - Pairing status (pairing mode initiated vs pairing complete)

These status indicators often use visual cues to communicate this information to players. This can exclude some players from using this information to guide successful device use.

The following video introduces these barriers in further detail. It presents best practice guidance on how this information can be provided to more players through accessible channels:
