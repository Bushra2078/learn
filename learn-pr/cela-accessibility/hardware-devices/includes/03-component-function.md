The player in the introductory scenario experienced accessibility barriers related to physical demands of unboxing their equipment and completing the required setup. In addition to players with physical disabilities, hardware devices can introduce barriers to all players.

For example, a player with no vision may experience the following challenges when tasked with setting up a new console device:

- Locating the ports and buttons on the console
- Identifying the functions of each port and button 
- Identifying the correct cable and inserting it into the proper port
- Determining whether they have properly completed the set-up process

In this unit, you will learn about accessibility best practices to help players discover and determine the function of hardware components. This unit also introduces best practices for accessible representation of hardware status indicators.

## Support accessible component discoverability and identification

Players with visual disabilities can encounter barriers when setting up and operating hardware devices. Players without vision may use their sense of touch and tactile cues when exploring new devices to identify the location of buttons or ports, for example. When the device element or control is not physically differentiated from its surroundings, its presence may go unnoticed by those who cannot see their presence. For buttons and ports that are discoverable, identifying the function of a button or port can be difficult for players with visual or learning disabilities.

With these challenges in mind, consider the following best practices to help players more easily discover and determine the function of hardware components on their devices.

- Ensure hardware components like buttons are discoverable through touch alone
- Use large font sizes and high contrast labels
- Use standard iconography and simple language on component labels
- Provide methods alternative to visual labels to identify component functionality, such as tactile indicators or sound

## Indicate device status through multiple sensory channels

Status indicators on hardware devices may only use color or visual cues to convey meaning as described by the following examples:

- A console may have a green-colored light that indicates it is powered on.
- The light may turn yellow or red to indicate a low battery. 
- When two devices are in Bluetooth “pairing” mode, indicator lights may blink. 
- Once devices are paired, the blinking lights can turn solid simultaneously.  

Indicators that use color or light as the sole means to convey information can prevent players with visual disabilities from completing setup processes or knowing when to charge their devices. Interpreting the meaning of indicator light colors or blinking patterns can pose challenges for players with cognitive disabilities. Players with cognitive disabilities may also have difficulty remembering the meaning of indicators which imposes additional cognitive processing and memorization requirements that a player may not be able to perform.

With these challenges in mind consider the following best practices to help players more easily discover and determine the function of hardware components on their devices.

- Avoid the use of color alone to represent status or identify function
- Represent status information through audio and haptic channels in addition to visual channels
- Portray status information in a way that is straight forward and easily understood by all players
