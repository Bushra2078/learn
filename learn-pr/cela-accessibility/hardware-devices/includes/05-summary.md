In this module, youâ€™ve learned about best practices for developing more accessible gaming hardware experiences and packaging components. Here is a summary of what we covered:

- Provide standard connection options like USB or Bluetooth on devices can help ensure that players can connect their assistive devices to supporting hardware products.
- Consider plausible adjustments to button size, height, and activation force during when developing accessible standard hardware device experiences.
- Represent device status information through multiple sensory channels including vision, audio, and tactile, to provide a more accessible experience for players with visual or cognitive disabilities.
- Implement accessible packaging components like tactile cues that inform proper device orientation, pull tabs to remove adhesive, and multiple options for device and component removal.
