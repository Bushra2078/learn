  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following scenarios most accurately describes packaging best practices that assist in device removal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tightly package the device and accompanying components to be sure they are not damaged in transit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While the purpose of packaging is to protect devices from damage, there are approaches that can be taken to ensure the device is safe while also providing an accessible unboxing experience."
    - content: "Include pull tabs or loops on components like plastic wrap around a device."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Tools like pull tabs or loops can help users remove a device from its inner packaging more easily, as they eliminate the need for users to wedge their finger under a device, or flip the entire inner packaging upside-down to loosen the device."
    - content: "Introduce pill-shaped indents on the surface of the device so players can pick it up regardless of the surrounding packaging."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This option would require alternations to the device itself. While it may assist using in removing devices from packaging, this approach would not be appropriate when it comes to making unboxing for any hardware device more accessible."
  - content: "Which options best describes how can the unboxing experience be made more accessible for heavier devices in which pull tabs or loops cannot be used to assist in device removal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provide empty “cavities” surrounding the device so users can more easily make hands-on contact with the device to remove it."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For devices that are heavier, such as a gaming console or do not have plastic wrap like the Surface tablet, empty cavities can be provided so users can more easily access the device to remove it from inner packaging."
    - content: "Use very strong adhesive to connect pull tabs or loops to the device to ensure they do not rip during use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This approach may help ensure that loops or tabs do not rip while using them to lift heavier devices, however, securing these loops or tabs to the device with strong adhesive can pose accessibility challenges for players when they must remove the strong adhesive."
    - content: "Eliminate surrounding inner packaging so the device is free within its larger, outer box, eliminating the need to “remove” it from inner packaging."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this approach would make it easier for users to remove their device from packaging altogether, it would not be the best approach considering the fact that the device could easily become damaged."
