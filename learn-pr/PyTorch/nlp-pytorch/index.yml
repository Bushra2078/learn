title: Introduction to Natural Language Processing with PyTorch
summary: Learn how to handle language and solve natural language processing tasks with PyTorch
abstract: |
  This module focuses on the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will learn about main NLP tasks, and will concentrate on classification. We will learn:
  - How to represent text and feed it to neural networks
  - How to represent meaning of text as number vector using embeddings
  - About special neural network architectures (RNNs, LSTMs, etc.) that can extract sequential patterns
  - The main idea behind state-of-the-art transformer architectures, attention, and how to use pre-trained transformer models to achieve higher accuracy of your NLP tasks
