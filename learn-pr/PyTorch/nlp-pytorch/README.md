# Module 3 - Natural Language Processing
## Intro

Natural Language Processing involves the intersection of computers and language. Traditional NLP tasks include, Text Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Question and Answering, Machine Reading Comprehension and more. 

In this module we will learn how to solve a simple question and answering problem NLP problem with PyTorch. Along the way you will the learn the fundamental skills you need to model your own natural language processing tasks.

- Representing Text (BoW, Word2Vec, Contextual Embeddings)
- Neural Language Modeling (From MLPs to Transformers)
- Simple Transfer Learning Demo (HuggingFace DistilBert Question and Answering)
