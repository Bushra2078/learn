In this module we introduced the key concepts to building machine learning models and implemented those concepts with PyTorch. We built a Computer Vision model that could classify images of T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boots. Now that you learned some of the basics of machine learning concepts, take a look at the below "What's Next?" section to learn more about building different types of machine learning models with PyTorch.

# What's Next?

There are other courses in the PyTorch fundamentals learning path that dive into more specific applications of deep learning and PyTorch. These include:

- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech and Audio Classification
