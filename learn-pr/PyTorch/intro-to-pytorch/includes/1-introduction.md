Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, optimizing model parameters, and saving the trained models. This module introduces you to a complete machine learning (ML) workflow implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), a popular ML framework for Python. 

Weâ€™ll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, or Ankle boot.

Before we jump into building the model, you will learn a set of core concepts required to understand the basics of building Machine Learning models. Then the last step will put it all together.

## Learning objectives

- Introduce the key concepts to building machine learning models
- Build a Computer Vision model
- Introduce you to building model with PyTorch API.
