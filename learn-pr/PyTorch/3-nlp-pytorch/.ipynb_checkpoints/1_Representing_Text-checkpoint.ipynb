    "# Introduction to Representing Text With Contextual Embeddings\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point you may be wondering what the term 'Contextual Embedding' even means. Don't worry by the end of this module that will be abundently clear. In order to understand better the concept lets first take a step back and look at problem of textual representation, some of the different approaches that have culminated in the current state of the art.\n",

    "At the in the third module we will look at sample PyTorch code using the HuggingFace transformers library that use contextual embeddings to make our Question and Answering model work.\n",

    "# What is Text Representation?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are here you proably at some point learned how to read, write and process language. Computers represent textual characters as numbers that map to fonts on your screen using coding formats such as ASCII or UTF-8. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Ascii Code](images/ASCII.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You and I can understand what the letters the fonts mapped to these codes **represent** and how each of their characters come together to form the words of this sentence. However computers by themselves do not have such an understanding. Therefore we need we need a mechanism to represent **text features** as features such as words and characters in order to train langugage models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How do we Represent Text with Computers?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different approaches to represent textual features in a format that can be modeled with machine learning. We've already mentioned that contextual embeddings is the state of the art but before we explain how contextual embeddigns work lets take a brief tour of the more tradional and early neural approaches for representing text.\n"

The TF-IDF value is a numerical statstic that reflect how prominent a word or n-gram is to a document in a collection. The TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently than others. \n",

    "\n",
    "As opposed to traditional distributional models neural embeddings such as Word to Vec are learned by training a neural langauge model to minimize a loss function for tasks that map to language understanding.  This process of training models on large collections of text to extract word representaions is called pre-training.  \n",

    "![word2vec image](images/word2vec.png)\n",

    "Both CBOW and Skip-Grams are “predictive” embeddings, in that they only take local contexts into account. Word2Vec does not take advantage of global context. FastText, built on Word2Vec by learning vector representations for each word and the charachter n-grams found within each word. The values of the representations are then averaged into one vector at each training step. While this adds a lot of additional computation to pre-training it enables word embeddings to encode sub-word information. \n",
