In this module, we will learn how to perform different computer vision tasks using PyTorch. Throughout this module, we will be using [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org), one of the most popular library for building neural networks. We will start with an introduction to a small Dense Neural Network (DNNs), then build on that knowledge to dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and lastly look how we can use pre-trained models in transfer learning to improve or results with less data.
