# Module 2 - Computer Vision

Goal here is to get folks solving a simple CV problem with PyTorch
(Current version of code: https://github.com/CloudAdvocacy/TorchVisionSamples)

- Introduction to Computer Vision tasks (object classification, detection, segmentation)
- Images as tensors. Simple DNN for MNIST classification
- Convolutional Neural Networks with MNIST
- Using pre-trained ResNet18 model
- Transfer learning with ResNet18: Cats vs. Dogs
- Optimized networks: Mobilenet
