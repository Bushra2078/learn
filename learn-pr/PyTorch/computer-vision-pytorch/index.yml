title: Introduction to Computer Vision with PyTorch 
summary: Learn how to perform different computer vision tasks using PyTorch.
abstract: |
  This module contains introduction to Computer Vision based on PyTorch framework. We will focus on most basic task - Image Classification - and learn about convolutional neural networks, and how pre-trained networks and transfer learning can be used to solve real-world problems. You will learn:
  - How to represent images as tensors and feed neural networks with images
  - About convolutional neural network architecture that can extract patterns from images
  - How to use pre-trained networks to solve real-world problems, minimize number of required data samples and build more accurate models
  - How to create low-profile networks that can be used on mobile and low power devices.
