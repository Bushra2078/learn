# Module 4 - Speech / Audio

Goal here is to get folks solving a simple Speech problem with PyTorch. We will use the Common Voice dataset to create a voice-to-text model.

- Intro: Understanding audio data
- Features, visualizations and transforms (waveform, spectrograms, frequency, amplitude and sample rate, down sampling, torchaudio)
- Sound as tensors
- Simple speech problem (speech-to-text) with CNN
- Apply Transfer learning with ResNet on audio
- Deploy and test model (raspberry pi or endpoint in aml)
