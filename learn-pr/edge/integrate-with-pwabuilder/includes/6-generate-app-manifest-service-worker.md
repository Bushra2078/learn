6.1 Generating and Customizing App Manifest

In this exercise, you'll practice generating an app manifest and service worker for a demo website using PWABuilder. Follow the steps below:

1.	If your previous session on PWABuilder is still active, continue from where you left off. If not, navigate to PWABuilder and enter the URL for the website you are converting to a PWA. For this exercise, we'll use https://webboard.app/. Click "Start" to analyze the demo website's PWA readiness.
2.	In the "Manifest" section, click "Edit Your Manifest" to generate and customize the App Manifest.
