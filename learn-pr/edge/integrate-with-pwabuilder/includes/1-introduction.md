This module will guide you through integrating Progressive Web App (PWA) features into your project. PWAs are web applications that provide app-like experiences to users, combining the best of web and native apps. In this module, it is highly recommended that you use your website to apply the concepts as you learn them. If you do not have a website for exercise, you can use https://webboard.app/, a simple whiteboard web application.  

By the end of this module, you will learn how to prepare your project for PWA integration, generate app manifests and service workers, customize your PWA settings and appearance, and configure PWA features.
