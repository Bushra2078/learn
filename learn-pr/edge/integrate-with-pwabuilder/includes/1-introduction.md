Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web applications that provide app-like experiences to users, combining the best of web and native apps. This module guides you through integrating PWA features into your project using PWABuilder.

It's highly recommended that you use your own website to apply the concepts in this module as you learn them. If you don't have a website for the exercises, you can use this simple whiteboard web application: <https://webboard.app/>.  

By the end of this module, you'll learn how to prepare your project for PWA integration, generate app manifests and service workers, customize your PWA settings and appearance, and configure PWA features.
