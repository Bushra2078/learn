In this module, you learned how to prepare a project for Progressive Web App (PWA) integration by assessing its core features, implementing best practices, and updating dependencies. You used PWABuilder to evaluate a website's PWA readiness, generate app manifest and service worker files, and customize its settings and appearance. Additionally, you explored how to modify your PWA's icons, theme colors, and display options, as well as configure features like push notifications, background sync, and offline analytics. By following these steps, you can transform your web project into a fully functional PWA, providing users with an enhanced, app-like experience. 

The next steps will be to test the PWA and publish it to Microsoft Store.
