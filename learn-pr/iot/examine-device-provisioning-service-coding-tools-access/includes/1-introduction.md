The Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) supports coding options that help you to provision devices at scale.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company will be provisioning and deploying of thousands of devices using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. The team needs to be familiar with the coding tools that they will be using. You decide to examine the Azure CLI support, SDK support, and how to control access to the service.

In this module, you will:

* Examine the Azure CLI support for the DPS
* Examine PowerShell support for the DPS
* Examine the SDKs associated with the DPS
* Examine user permissions and how to control access to DPS

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the coding tool options that can be used to deploy devices at scale using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service.
