  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements is most correct for ThreadX RTOS scheduling?"
    choices:
        - content: "It uses a priority-based preemptive scheduling approach."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is true, but note the other statements are also correct."
        - content: "It quickly responds to important events because it does not have to wait for any polling."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is true, but note the other statements are also correct."
        - content: "It schedules the ready thread with the highest priority that has been waiting for the processor the longest."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is true, but note the other statements are also correct."
        - content: "All of the above."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "All these statements are correct."

  - content: "Which of the following statements is most correct for threads?"
    choices:
        - content: "It is possible for a thread to be in a ready state and a suspended state at the same time."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A thread cannot be both in a ready state and a suspended state at the same time."
        - content: "Under certain circumstances, a suspended thread can be executed."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A suspended thread would have to become ready before being executed."
        - content: "Each thread must have its own stack."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct."
        - content: "All thread stacks must be the same size."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A stack can be any size, but it must be large enough for successful thread operation."

  - content: "Which of the following statements is most correct for thread suspension?"
    choices:
        - content: "There is only one way for a thread to become suspended."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There are many ways for a thread to become suspended."
        - content: "A thread can be suspended because it needs a resource that is unavailable."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct."
        - content: "The length of time for a thread to be suspended depends on its priority."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Suspension time has nothing to do with priority."
        - content: "When a thread is removed from the suspended state, it is immediately terminated."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "In most cases, a suspended thread enters the ready state."
 
  - content: "Which of the following statements is most correct?"
    choices:
        - content: "The Thread Control Block schedules all the threads."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Thread Control Block contains essential thread information and does no scheduling."
        - content: "The thread entry function stores the priority of a thread."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The thread entry function stores executable code."
        - content: "The thread stack size is not important, so it can be assigned any value."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Stack size is crucial and must be assigned a value large enough for successful thread operation."
        - content: "There is no explicit limit on how many threads can be created."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct."

  - content: "Which of the following statements is most correct?"
    choices:
        - content: "The context of a thread refers to the contents of the Thread Control Block."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Thread context usually consists of register contents, program counter, and stack pointer."
        - content: "When a thread's context has been restored, its priority is decreased by 1."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There is no connection between priority and thread context."
        - content: "When a thread is preempted, its context must be saved."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct."
        - content: "A thread's context contains the number of times that thread has been preempted."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Thread context usually consists of register contents, program counter, and stack pointer."
