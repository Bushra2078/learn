## Introduction

*ProjectMessageQueues.c* contains three threads and two queues, where one of the threads sends messages to the queues. The other two threads are waiting for messages from the queues, and they receive them as they're sent. You get to observe the behavior of the queues and the threads, and then modify the project by adding one thread and one queue.

> [!TIP]
> Refer to [Set up your environment](/learn/modules/introduction-azure-rtos/2-set-up-environment?azure-portal=true) before getting started on the exercises in this module.

## Use GitHub Codespaces

1. Open the codespace you've created from GitHub repo. Once done, you can view the sample projects repo within VSCode web.

1. Expand the **TASK EXPLORER** pane and expand the **vscode** node you'll find **Build / Clean / Run Project** tasks. Choose **Build Project** and select the run button.

   ![VSCode Web Task Explorer](../../introduction-azure-rtos/media/vscode-web-tasks.png)

1. Choose **ProjectMessageQueues** to build the project.

1. Now choose **Run Project** in the same **TASK EXPLORER**.

## Use Visual Studio

1. Open the solution `azure_rtos_threadx_training.sln` in Visual Studio.

1. In the **Solution Explorer**, right click on **ProjectMessageQueues** and select **Set as Startup Project**.

1. Select the **Build** tab and choose **Build ProjectMessageQueues** to build your project. Then select the **Debug** tab, followed by **Start debugging** to debug your project.

## Complete the sample

If all has gone well, you should see initial output appearing on the screen similar to the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../media/figure-21-partial-output-from-project-message-queues.png" alt-text="Sample initial output." border="false":::

At 200 timer ticks, the Urgent thread received 14 messages, the Routine thread received 12 messages, and there was 1 message remaining in the Routine Queue. What do you think will happen when another thread and another queue are added to the project?

Your task is to add a third thread called Important and a third queue that is also called Important. The Important thread has a priority of 12. The diagram below contains a modified scenario of your project with the addition of the Important thread and queue. The attributes of Urgent thread and Routine thread remain the same.

The following diagram contains a description of the thread activities with the queue.

> [!NOTE]
> The building blocks described in a previous unit contain tips about the modifications you need, summarized below:
> - [Building block 1, part 2](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/threadx-message-queues/6-building-blocks#building-block-1-part-2) - Add two counters, one thread, one queue, and one prototype
> - [Building block 3, part 1](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/threadx-message-queues/6-building-blocks#building-block-3-part-1) - Add one stack pointer and one queue pointer
> - [Building block 3, part 2](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/threadx-message-queues/6-building-blocks#building-block-3-part-2) - Allocate stack space, create another thread, queue space create another queue
> - [Building block 4 `dispatcher thread entry`](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/threadx-message-queues/6-building-blocks#building-block-4-dispatcher-thread-entry) - Increment message counter, and send messages to the new queue with a sleep time of 5
> - [Building block 4 `routine thread entry`](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/threadx-message-queues/6-building-blocks#building-block-4-routine-thread-entry) - Use the Routine entry function as a guide to create the new Important entry function with a sleep time of 21
> - [Building block 4 `print_stats`](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/threadx-message-queues/6-building-blocks#building-block-4-print-stats) - Get contents for queue Important, and add `printf` statements to include the new thread counter, message number, and queue contents

When you finish your modifications, then build and debug *ProjectMessageQueues.c* to produce output similar to the image shown below:

:::image type="content" source="../media/figure-25-final-output.png" alt-text="Final output for this project." border="false":::

At 200 timer ticks, the Dispatcher thread had sent 30 messages, Urgent thread received 10 messages, Routine thread received 10 messages, and Important thread received 9 messages. There was 1 message in ImportantQueue, and the other 2 queues were empty. If you would allow this project to run longer, what would happen to the queues?
