Message queues are the primary means of inter-thread communication in ThreadX. One or more messages can reside in a message queue, which generally observes a FIFO discipline. Messages are usually sent to the rear of a queue, but messages are always received from the front of the queue. Thread suspension can occur either when a queue is full and a thread tries to send a message to that queue, or when a queue is empty and a thread tries to read a message from that queue.

We'll first investigate how to create message queues, how to send messages to a queue, and how to receive messages from a queue. The name of this project is ProjectMessageQueue.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:
   - Understand how to send messages from one thread to another thread by using a message queue.
   - Understand how to receive messages from a queue.
   - Understand how to send a message to the front of a queue, rather than to the rear of the queue.
   - Design and debug the ThreadX solution using a hands-on approach with GitHub Codespace or Visual Studio.
