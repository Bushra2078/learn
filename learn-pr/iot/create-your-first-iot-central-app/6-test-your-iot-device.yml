  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'What keys are required to connect an app to IoT Central?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Device ID and primary key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Both of these values are needed, but a connection requires more information.
    - content: 'ID scope, device ID, and primary key'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. These three strings identify the app, the device, and permission to communicate with IoT Central.
    - content:  'ID scope, device ID, primary key, and secondary key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The secondary key isn't needed.
      
  - content: 'In our scenario, what states can the cooling fan be in?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'On, off, and failed'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A failing cooling fan triggers a series of events that are useful to simulate. These events include melting contents and truck recalls.
    - content: 'On, off, and melting'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A melting cooling fan would be bad, but it isn't something that's simulated.
    - content: 'On and off'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Unfortunately, mechanical systems aren't perfect enough to have just these two states.

  - content: 'In our scenario, the simulated time interval is 60 seconds. The actual time interval is 5 seconds. What does this mean?'
    choices:    
    - content: 'The simulation runs in real time. Twelve sets of telemetry data are communicated to IoT Central every minute.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Telemetry data is sent 12 times per minute, but the simulation doesn't run in real time.
    - content: 'The simulation runs 60 times faster than real time. Telemetry is reported every five seconds.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The simulation doesn't run 60 times faster than real time.
    - content: 'The simulation runs 60/5 = 12 times faster than real time.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Many simulations are set to run faster than real time.
