title: Create your first Azure IoT Central app
summary: >
  This module builds an IoT Central app to monitor and command a fleet of refrigerated trucks. The first unit creates the app, the second unit defines a device template for a refrigerated truck. Then, a programming project is created, and code is added and tested for a single truck. Finally, code is added for multiple trucks, and these trucks are monitored through a custom dashboard.
