title: Create your first Azure IoT Central app
summary: >
  This module builds an IoT Central app to monitor and command a refrigerated truck. After you create the app, you define a device template for a refrigerated truck. You then create a programming project, add code to simulate a truck, and communicate with your IoT Central app. You monitor the truck by using a custom dashboard.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you'll:
  - Create an Azure IoT Central custom app by using the IoT Central portal.
  - Create a device template for a custom device by using the IoT Central portal.
