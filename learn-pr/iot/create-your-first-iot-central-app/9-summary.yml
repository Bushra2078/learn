      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These two values are all we needed in the refrigerated truck scenario, but there's more to a Geopoint.
    - content: 'X and Y coordinates'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: X and Y coordinates work best on 2D rectangular graphs, rather than a spheroid such as the Earth.
