  questions:

  - content: 'Which ID is identical for all devices that connect to one IoT Central app?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'ID scope'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The ID scope identifies the IoT Central app.
    - content: 'Device ID'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The device ID is unique to each device.
    - content: 'Primary key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The primary key is unique to each device.

  - content: 'In the IoT Central portal, what is the name of the process for authenticating devices to IoT Central?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Authenticating'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Good try, but no. There's a specific name for device authentication.
    - content: 'Servicing'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Servicing is broader than device authentication.
    - content: 'Provisioning'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. This term is what you'll see in the IoT Central portal.
      
  - content: 'Internally, what elements make up a geopoint?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Latitude, longitude, and altitude'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Our scenario doesn't use altitude, but some applications require it.
    - content: 'Latitude and longitude'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Our refrigerated truck scenario requires only these two values, but a geopoint includes more than just these values.
    - content: 'X and Y coordinates'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. X and Y coordinates work best on 2D rectangular graphs. They don't work as well on a spheroid such as Earth.
    - content: 'Latitude, longitude, and time'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The space-time dimension isn't part of a geopoint.
