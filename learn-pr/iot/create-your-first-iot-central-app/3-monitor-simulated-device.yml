  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which option includes all of the capability types available in a device template?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Telemetry, commands, properties'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. These elements are the three capability types.
    - content: 'Telemetry, state, event, location'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Event and location are types of telemetry.
    - content: 'Telemetry, state, commands'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. State is a type of telemetry.

  - content: 'What is the purpose of the Name attribute that appears in all device template elements?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'It names the element in the IoT Central portal UI.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This purpose applies to the display name.
    - content: 'It describes the element.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Sometimes a description field is available, but the Name attribute isn't the title of this field.
    - content: 'It enables communication by matching the entries in the code that runs on the IoT device.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Names must exactly match the names in the code that runs on the device.
    - content: 'It appears in tooltips when the operator selects an element in the app UI.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Names aren't descriptive text.

  - content: 'What is a writeable property?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'A property that can be written to in the device app but not changed by the IoT Central app.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. IoT Central can change a writeable property. 
    - content: 'A property that can be written to by the IoT Central app but not by the device app.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A device app can change any of its own properties.
    - content: 'A property that can be written to by the IoT Central app. It is picked up by the device app.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A property such as optimal temperature can be set by using a default value. But the IoT Central app can write a new value if needed.
  
  - content: 'What control makes a device template available for use?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Publish'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Publishing a template makes it available in your IoT app.
    - content: 'Save'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Save control saves the elements of your interface. But it doesn't make a device template available for use.
    - content: 'Views'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Views control is used to create dashboards.
    - content: 'Delete'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Delete control deletes the device template from the application.
