## Overview

In the previous unit, you investigated the ThreadX user guide. In this unit, we'll investigate an online book for ThreadX. Each of these resources provides you with information about ThreadX. The primary difference between these resources is that the user guide is a reference document, and the online book is a textbook. Consider each of these resources and decide whether one is better for your learning style.

## Organization of the online book

The ThreadX book contains 13 chapters. Following is a list of the chapter titles.

|Chapter|Title|
|-------------|-----|
|`1` | Embedded and Real-time Systems|
|`2` | First Look at a System Using an RTOS|
|`3` | RTOS Concepts and Definitions|
|`4` | RTOS Building Blocks for System Development|
|`5` | The Threadâ€”The Essential Component|
|`6` | Mutual Exclusion Challenges and Considerations|
|`7` | Memory Management: Byte Pools and Block Pools|
|`8` | Internal System Clock and Application Timers|
|`9` | Event Notification and Synchronization with Counting Semaphores|
|`10` | Synchronization of Threads Using Event Flags Groups|
|`11` | Thread Communication with Message Queues|
|`12` | Advanced Topics|
|`13` | Case Study: Designing a Multithreaded System|

The online book was designed to be read in sequence, starting with Chapter 1. However, given your background in ThreadX, you should be able to start with any chapter.
