Congratulations, you've completed all the development and testing work for this module. Let's summarize what we've learned, and finish with a short knowledge check.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an Azure IoT Central custom app, using the IoT Central portal
- Import a model for a custom device, using the IoT Central portal
- Create a programming project to simulate a refrigerated truck, using Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio
- Monitor and command the simulated truck, from an IoT Central dashboard
- Create a range of rules and actions, responding to truck telemetry, using the IoT Central portal

## Clean up

The IoT Central app, with a Trial subscription, will be deleted automatically when the trial comes to an end.

All rules associated with device templates that are part of the Trial subscription, will also be automatically deleted.

If you created a new Azure Maps account for this module, you will need to clean up your account by deleting the resource. If you created a new resource group for your Azure Maps account, then you need to delete the resource group, and this will automatically delete the Azure Maps account.

## Next steps

Take your interest further with:

- [Azure IoT Central Documentation](/azure/iot-central/)
- [Build workflows with the IoT Central connector in Microsoft Flow](/azure/iot-central/howto-add-microsoft-flow)

And look out for additional Learn modules covering IoT Central.
