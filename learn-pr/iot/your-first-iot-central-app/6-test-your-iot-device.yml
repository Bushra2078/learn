  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'A connection string is an encoded version of what?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Device ID and Primary Key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Both these are needed, but more information is needed to complete the string.
    - content: 'Scope ID, Device ID, and Primary Key'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These three strings identify the app, the device, and permission to communicate with IoT Central.
    - content:  'Scope ID, Device ID, Primary Key, and Secondary Key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Secondary Key is not needed.
      
  - content: 'In our scenario, what does the following Node.js statement do:  setInterval(sendTruckTelemetry, 5000)?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Specifies that the sendTruckTelemetry function should be called every five seconds.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This is an important call set in the device callback, determining how often telemetry is sent.
    - content: 'Specifies that the sendTruckTelemetry function should be called every 0.5 of a second.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 0.5 is not the correct interval.
    - content: 'Specifies that sendTruckTelemetry is a data structure, that should be communicated at the specified interval.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The sendTruckTelemetry name does not identify a data structure.

  - content: 'In our scenario, the simulated time interval is 60 seconds, the actual time interval is 5 seconds. What does this mean?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The simulation is run at 60/5 = 12 times real time.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Many simulations are set to run faster than real time.
    - content: 'The simulation runs in real time, with 12 sets of telemetry data communicated to IoT Central every minute.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Telemetry data is sent 12 times per minute, but the simulation does not run in real time.
    - content: 'The simulation runs at 60 times real time, with the telemetry reported every five seconds.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The simulation does not run at 60 times real time.

  - content: "In our scenario, interpret the following line of code:  client.onDeviceMethod('cmdGoTo', CmdGoToCustomer)?"
    choices:
    - content: 'The IoT Central app has a command with Field Name "cmdGoTo", and the Node.js app has a function "CmdGoToCustomer" to be called when the operator invokes cmdGoTo.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The order of parameters in most references to IoT Central is the Field Name followed by the Node.js app name. This applies to Telemetry, Events, Properties, Settings, as well as Commands.
    - content: 'The IoT Central app has a command with Field Name "CmdGoToCustomer", and the Node.js app has a function "cmdGoTo" to be called when the operator invokes CmdGoToCustomer.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The names are the wrong way round.
    - content: 'Two commands, with functions named CmdGoToCustomer and cmdGoTo, are defined in the Node.js app.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These two names refer to one command.
