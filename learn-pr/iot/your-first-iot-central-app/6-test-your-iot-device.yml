  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'A connection string is an encoded version of what?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Device Id and Primary Key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: More information is needed.
    - content: 'Scope Id, Device Id, and Primary Key'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct.
    - content:  'Scope Id, Device Id, Primary Key, and Secondary Key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Secondary Key is not needed.
  - content: 'In our scenario, what does the following Node.JS statement do:  setInterval(sendTruckTelemetry, 5000);?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Specifies that the sendTruckTelemetry function should be called every 5 seconds.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct.
    - content: 'Specifies that the sendTruckTelemetry function should be called every 0.5 seconds.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not the correct interval.
    - content: 'Specifies that sendTruckTelemetry is a data structure, that should be communicated at the specified interval.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: sendTruckTelemetry is not a data structure.
  - content: 'In our scenario, the simulated time interval is 60 seconds, the actual time interval is 5 seconds. What does this mean?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The simulation is run at 60/5 = 12 times real time.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct.
    - content: 'The simulation runs in real time, with 12 sets of telemetry data communicated to IoT Central.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: In a real-time simulation, it would take hours for a truck to reach its destination.
    - content: 'The simulation runs at 60 times real time, with the telemetry reported every 5 seconds.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: One call, every 5 seconds, to the UpdateTruck function advances the simulation by 60 seconds (var interval = 60;).
  - content: "In our scenario, interpret the following line of code:  client.onDeviceMethod('cmdGoTo', CmdGoToCustomer); ?"
    choices:
    - content: 'The IoT Central app has a command with Field Name "cmdGoTo", and the NodeJS app has a function "CmdGoToCustomer" to be called with the operator invokes cmdGoTo.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct.
    - content: 'The IoT Central app has a command with Field Name "CmdGoToCustomer", and the NodeJS app has a function "cmdGoTo" to be called with the operator invokes CmdGoToCustomer.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Got the names the wrong way round.
