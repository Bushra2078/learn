  questions:

  - content: 'Which of the following lists all of the types of Measurements in a Device Template?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Telemetry, State, Event, Properties'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Properties are not Measurements.
    - content: 'Telemetry, State, Event, Location'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These elements are the four types of Measurements.
    - content: 'Telemetry, State, Event, Settings'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Settings are not Measurements.

  - content: 'What is the purpose of the Field Name attribute that appears in all Device Template elements?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'To appear in the IoT Central portal UI, naming the element being displayed.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This purpose applies to the Display Name.
    - content: 'To act as a description of the element.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Sometimes a description field is available, but Field Name is not the name of this field.
    - content: 'To match the entries in the code running on the IoT device, to enable communications.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Field Names must be copied exactly in the code running on the device.
    - content: 'To appear in tooltip type text boxes when the operator clicks on an element in the app UI.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Field Names are not descriptive text.

  - content: 'What is the difference in concept between a Device Template Setting and a Device Template Property?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Properties and Settings can be used interchangeably.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Settings and Commands have some similarities. Properties are not sent by the cloud.
    - content: 'Properties are communicated from the cloud to the device. Settings are communicated from the device to the cloud.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Properties are communicated from the device to the cloud, and Settings from the cloud to the device.
    - content: 'A Property is typically communicated once from the device to the cloud, a Setting is typically communicated from the cloud to the device, when changes are needed.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A Property might be something like a unique ID (a truck license plate, for example). A Setting must have a corresponding value, such as an optimal temperature for the truck contents.

      explanation: State is shown in the bar graphs.
    - content: 'Telemetry'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Telemetry is shown in the line chart.
    - content: 'Locations'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Location is shown on the map view.
