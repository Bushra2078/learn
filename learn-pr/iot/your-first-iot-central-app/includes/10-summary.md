## Next Steps

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an IoT Central app
- Specify a device template, to provide all the communication data required for a device (the refrigerated truck) to communicate with IoT Central
- View simulated communicated data, both in the three device views (chart, table, and map), and by creating a custom dashboard



Before we plunge into the next module, and add the accurate routing of trucks, let's have a knowledge check to cement what we have learnt so far.
