## Next Steps

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an IoT Central app
- Specify a device template, to provide all the communication data required for a device (the refrigerated truck) to communicate with IoT Central
- View simulated communicated data, both in the three device views (chart, table, and map), and by creating a custom dashboard

You also learned the limitations of a purely simulated device, our truck flies about with superpowers. The next step is to tie the movements of the truck to real-world map data. This data will be provided by Azure Maps.

Before we plunge into the next module, and add the accurate routing of trucks, let's have a knowledge check to cement what we have learnt so far.
