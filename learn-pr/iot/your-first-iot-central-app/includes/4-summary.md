## Next Steps

In this module, you learned:

- how to create an IoT Central app
- how to specify a device template to provide all the communication data required for IoT Central device (the refrigerated truck) to communicate
- how to view the communicated data, both in the three device views (chart, table, and map), and by creating a custom dashboard

You also learned the limitations of a purely simulated device, our truck flies about with superpowers. The next step is to tie the movements of the truck to real-world map data, provided by Azure Maps.

Before we plunge into the next module, and add the accurate routing of trucks, let's have a knowledge check to cement what we have learnt so far.
