  description: This module covers continuous data export from IoT Central. You use the scenario from your previously completed "Create your first Azure IoT Central app" Learn module, where you controlled a refrigerated truck. Here, in this module, you add continuous data export to both Azure Blob storage and an event hub. You then build a Power BI app to read and display the telemetry data on a mobile phone.

title: Set up continuous data export from Azure IoT Central to a Power BI app
summary: >
  This module covers continuous data export from IoT Central. You use the scenario from your previously completed "Create your first Azure IoT Central app" Learn module, where you controlled a refrigerated truck. Here, in this module, you add continuous data export to both Azure Blob storage and an event hub. You then build a Power BI app to read and display the telemetry data on a mobile phone.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Create an Azure IoT Central custom app by using the IoT Central portal.
  - Import a capability model for a custom device by using the IoT Central portal.
  - Create a programming project to simulate a refrigerated truck by using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio.
  - Create a storage account, and export all the incoming data into that account by using the IoT Central portal.
  - Create an Azure event hub for routing data through an Azure Stream Analytics job by using the IoT Central portal.
  - Create an external app to view the data by using Power BI.
prerequisites: |
  - Introductory knowledge of the purpose of Azure IoT
  - Ability to navigate the Azure IoT Central portal 
  - Ability to use Node.js or C# at the beginner level 
  - Experience using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code at the beginner level
