  - content: 'Conveyor belt vibration is measured in what units?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'acceleration'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The two common units of vibration are acceleration in m/s<sup>2</sup>, or in g-forces.
    - content: 'pressure'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Pressure sensors are common, but it is not a measure of vibration.
    - content: 'deciBels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Perhaps sound vibrations could be measured in deciBels, but, realistically, not conveyor belts.
    - content: 'rotational velocity'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Vibration is a bit more complex than a simple velocity.
