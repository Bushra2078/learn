  questions:

  - content: 'Conveyor belt vibration is measured in what units?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'pressure'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Pressure sensors are common, but it is not a measure of vibration.
    - content: 'decibels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Sound vibrations could be measured in decibels, but, realistically, not conveyor belts.
    - content: 'velocity'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Vibration is a bit more complex than a simple velocity.
    - content: 'acceleration'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The two common units of vibration are acceleration in m/s<sup>2</sup>, or in g-forces.

  - content: 'An IoT Hub name must be unique across what space?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'The worldwide web'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The IoT Hub name forms the unique part of the Azure URL, so must be unique across the web.
    - content: 'Your Azure resources'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The name needs to be unique across a wider space than just your resources.
    - content: 'All Azure resources'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The name needs to be unique across a wider space than all Azure resources.
    - content: 'All Azure IoT Hub names'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The name needs to be unique across a wider space than all Azure IoT Hub names.

  - content: 'How did our sample C# device app warn the operator if the conveyor belt stopped for greater than 5 seconds?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'As an entry in the message data'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An alert could be sent this way, however, our app does not use this approach.
    - content: 'As a named property - beltAlert - with a value set to true if the condition was met.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Properties can be simple, such as device IDs, or more complex types such as conditional alerts.
    - content: 'As an attached event to the message'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There is no mechanism to attach events to messages.
    - content: 'As a separate warning message, with an HTTP code of 400'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There is no need to send a separate message, alerts can be added to a message as message data, or as a message property.
  
  - content: 'What is the purpose of Azure Event Hubs?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Azure Event Hubs is a central message hub, for bi-directional communications with remote devices.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bi-directional communications is the role of an IoT Hub.
    - content: 'Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed service to move certain workloads to the edge of the network.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Moving work to the edge of the network is the role of Azure Iot Edge.
    - content: 'Azure Event Hubs is a data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The processed event data can be stored, run through Azure Stream Analytics, and other cloud processes.
    - content: 'Azure Event Hubs is a real-time analytics service, designed for demanding workloads.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Analyzing demanding streaming workloads is the role of Azure Stream Analytics.
