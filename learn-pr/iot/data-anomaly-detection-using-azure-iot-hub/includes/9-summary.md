## Clean up

When you're satisfied you don't need to return to the VibrationSensorHub, delete the device, then delete the hub. These options are available in your [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home).

All resources created using the sandbox will be automatically deleted.

No need to delete your project code though, keep it for future reference!
