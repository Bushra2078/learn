In this module, you learned how to:

- Create a custom Azure IoT Hub, using the Azure portal
- Create a device ID for a custom device, using the Azure portal
- Create an app to simulate a device monitoring conveyor belt vibrations
- Create an app to provide a back-end service to listen for the telemetry sent by the device
- Add stream analytics, and machine learning, to process the incoming telemetry
- Add BI output to visualize the data anomalies

## Clean up

When you're satisfied you do not need to return to the VibrationSensorHub, delete the device, then delete the hub. These options are available in your [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home).

No need to delete your project code though, keep it for future reference!
