summary: >
  This module describes Azure IoT message routing, Event Hubs, Azure Stream Analytics jobs, anomaly detection, as well as Azure IoT Hubs. The scenario is detecting vibration in a conveyor belt. The student writes an app to simulate vibration telemetry, and then builds all the Azure resources needed to analyze the data.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Create an Azure IoT Hub, using the Azure portal
  - Create an Azure IoT Hub device identity, using the Azure portal
  - Create a C# app to send device telemetry to the IoT Hub, using Visual Studio or Visual Studio code
  - Create a message route, through to blob storage, using the Azure portal
  - Create a second message route, through to an Azure Analytics job, using the Azure portal
  - Create a dashboard to visualize data anomalies, using Power BI
prerequisites: | 
  - An introductory knowledge of Azure IoT
  -	Ability to navigate the Azure IoT portal 
  -	Ability to use C#, at the beginner level
  -	Experience using Visual Studio, or Visual Studio Code, at the beginner level
