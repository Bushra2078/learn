Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Azure IoT Central can be used to build your organization's IoT solutions. The following criteria were developed to help guide your decision:

- Experience
- Customization

We applied these criteria to our fictitious national grocery store chain scenario to evaluate if Azure IoT Central was suitable for its IoT needs. We concluded that Azure IoT Central could be used to connect the different types of IoT devices the company wanted to use, monitor device data in real-time, and analyze historical data to identify store trends. These capabilities of Azure IoT Central will allow local store managers to better fulfill their staffing needs to improve shopper experience.

Likewise, these criteria can be used to help you determine if Azure IoT Central is the appropriate choice for your organization's IoT solution. They'll help focus your attention on areas that should be considered during the planning stage of a new IoT project to avoid common setbacks and ensure a successful outcome.
