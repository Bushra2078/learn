Internet of Things (IoT) has reshaped several industries within the last decade, including retail, energy, manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare. Our society's dependence on IoT solutions is growing and companies are responding by finding new, innovative ways to incorporate IoT into their products. As a result, many are discovering that building IoT solutions from scratch that are secure, reliable, and scalable isn't as straightforward as expected.

Azure IoT Central is Microsoft's solution to common issues faced when building IoT applications. The application platform comes with features to connect and manage devices. To monitor, alert, and take actions based on triggered rules. Visualize device data using dashboards and analytics, to get insights and extend capabilities into other line-of-business applications using continuous data export and APIs. These features enable users to quickly implement IoT solutions to fit their business needs.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work in the IT department of a national grocery store chain. In recent years, corporate has received several customer complaints about long wait times in checkout lanes. You've found that current company policy used for staff scheduling doesn't meet the needs of every local store.

As the lead developer, you've been tasked with designing a solution that will allow each store to **collect**, **monitor**, and **analyze** data from different types of IoT devices for the first time. These devices will differ in sensor types, such as: proximity sensors at entrances to monitor traffic, optical sensors on building exteriors and accelerometers on shopping carts. The data will contain confidential information and should be secured so competitors don't have access to it.

Store managers will use the results of the analysis to properly schedule staff based on their store's needs. To ensure they don't miss any critical notifications, your team has plans to design a custom notification feature.

## What will we be doing?

We'll analyze the capabilities of Azure IoT Central and help you decide when to use it for your IoT solutions to:

- **Collect** and securely store data from different types of IoT devices.
- **Monitor** IoT data in real time with user-friendly dashboards.
- **Analyze** trends to base your future business decisions and predictions on.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to evaluate whether Azure IoT Central can be used to build your organization's IoT solutions.
