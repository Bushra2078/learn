Starting notes: 
"   * Restate the scenario problem(s) -- Factory with robotic arms is tracking how many packages the arms fail to pick up.
    * Show how you solved the scenario problem(s) -- Created a digital representation that can be quickly queried to see which arms are missing packages, and with what frequency.
    * Describe the experience without the product -- No modeling structure or query language (to see digital insights, you'd have to build an app from scratch);  no visuals.
    * Describe the business impact -- Factory operators can see dashboards indicating quickly which boxes were missed. This can be used to recover missed packages with minimal downtime, and also indicate what machines may need maintenance to increase future productivity."
