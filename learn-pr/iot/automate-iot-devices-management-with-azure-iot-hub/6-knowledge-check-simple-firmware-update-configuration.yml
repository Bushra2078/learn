  questions:

  - content: 'Firmware Updates on IoT devices are necessary...'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Only the first time the device boots.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Update IoT devices to receive latest security updates and patches as well as software updates for new features and enhancements. And for small IoT devices it is often simpler and safer to update the entire firmware.
    - content: 'Only when hardware changes are made (new peripherals attached, new sensors added)'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Update IoT devices to receive latest security updates and patches as well as software updates for new features and enhancements. And for small IoT devices it is often simpler and safer to update the entire firmware.
    - content: 'Regularly during the device''s life cycle'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct, update IoT devices regularly to receive latest security updates and patches as well as software updates for new features and enhancements. And for small IoT devices it is often simpler and safer to update the entire firmware.
    - content: 'At first boot then only when hardware changes are made (new peripherals attached, new sensors added)'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Update IoT devices to receive latest security updates and patches as well as software updates for new features and enhancements. And for small IoT devices it is often simpler and safer to update the entire firmware.

  - content: 'IoT devices are becoming more exposed to security threats because...'
    choices:  
    - content: 'They are more and more often connected to the broader web'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All answers are correct.
    - content: 'Being physically exposed they are more prone to being compromised.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All answers are correct.
    - content: 'All of the above'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct.

  - content: 'On IoT devices, it is always simpler to update software packages individually'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Yes, IoT Devices can easily be updated by pushing new versions of software libraries using package managers such as apt or npm'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Majority of IoT Devices run on tiny embedded OSs or sometimes without actual operating system and rarely have a package manager available, hence the need to update full firmware rather than individual software packages.
    - content: 'No, it is simpler to update the whole firmware on IoT devices'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Majority of IoT Devices run on tiny embedded OSs or sometimes without actual operating system and rarely have a package manager available, hence the need to update full firmware rather than individual software packages.

  - content: 'What are the most common aspects of over-the-air IoT devices firmware updates'
    choices:  
    - content: 'None, IoT devices firmware updates vary a lot from one device to another.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Firmware come in binary file formats, are versioned, available for devices to acquire online, and device manufacturers provide instructions or implementing the sequence of operations required to update the firmware.
    - content: 'Firmware come in binary file formats, are versioned, available for devices to acquire online.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct, additionally, device manufacturers provide instructions or implementing the sequence of operations required to update the firmware.
    - content: 'Device Manufacturers rarely provide detailed instructions on how to implement a firmware update.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Firmware come in binary file formats, are versioned, available for devices to acquire online, and device manufacturers provide instructions or implementing the sequence of operations required to update the firmware.

  - content: 'When creating a device management configuration, the Device Twin Property field has to start with:'
    choices:  
    - content: 'properties.desired'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation:  You indeed have to define a desired property, hence the need to prefix the value in the field with "properties.desired".
    - content: 'properties.reported'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  You actually have to define a desired property, hence the need to prefix the value in the field with "properties.desired".
    - content: 'properties.tags'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  You actually have to define a desired property, hence the need to prefix the value in the field with "properties.desired".
    - content: 'None of the above'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  You actually have to define a desired property, hence the need to prefix the value in the field with "properties.desired".

  - content: 'When creating a device management configuration, the Target Devices condition can be:'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Only one Device Twin Tag'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  Valid conditions specify either a deviceId (for example, deviceId='{ID}'), one or more device twin tags criteria (for example, tags.environment = 'prod' AND tags.location = 'westus'), or reported property criteria.
    - content: 'Either a deviceId or only one device twin tag'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  Valid conditions specify either a deviceId (for example, deviceId='{ID}'), one or more device twin tags criteria (for example, tags.environment = 'prod' AND tags.location = 'westus'), or reported property criteria.
    - content: 'Either a deviceId or one or more device twin tags'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  Valid conditions specify either a deviceId (for example, deviceId='{ID}'), one or more device twin tags criteria (for example, tags.environment = 'prod' AND tags.location = 'westus'), or reported property criteria.
    - content: 'Either a deviceId, one or more device twin tags, or a reported property criteria'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation:  Correct, valid conditions specify either a deviceId (for example, deviceId='{ID}'), one or more device twin tags criteria (for example, tags.environment = 'prod' AND tags.location = 'westus'), or reported property criteria.
