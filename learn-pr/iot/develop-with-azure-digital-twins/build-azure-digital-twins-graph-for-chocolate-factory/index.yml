summary: >
  This module covers the first steps in building an Azure Digital Twins solution. The units cover making an instance of Azure Digital Twins, and learning about, creating, and visualizing, DTDL models. You will create, validate, graph, and query, models for a chocolate factory production line.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Create an instance of Azure Digital Twins (ADT) using the Azure portal
  - Create digital models for the production line of a chocolate factory in DTDL
  - Validate the digital models using the DTDL Validator sample
  - Create a graph of the models using the ADT Explorer sample
  - Query the graph using SQL-like queries
prerequisites: |
  - Introductory knowledge of the purpose of Azure IoT
  - Ability to navigate the Azure IoT portal
  - Ability to use the Command Prompt and command line windows
  - Ability to download and install software tools
  - Ability to use Visual Studio at the beginner level
  - A Basic understanding of the Azure CLI. Following [Control Azure services with the CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/control-azure-services-with-cli/) module is recommended
  - [Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - It is recommended to install AZ CLI locally
    - It is not recommended to use the Azure Cloud Shell as it will timeout due to the length of the lab
   - Access to an Azure subscription where you have Administrator role for your account as well as Azure Active Directory Tenant to complete the exercise units
