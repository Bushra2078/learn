Congratulations, you've completed all the development and testing work for this module!

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an instance of Azure Digital Twins by using the Azure portal.
- Create digital models for the production line of a chocolate factory.
- Validate the digital models by using the validator sample.
- Create a graph of the models by using the Azure Digital Twins explorer sample.
- Query the graph by using SQL-like queries.

You also learned a bit about chocolate production!

## Clean up

Delete the resources manually by locating the Azure Digital Twins instance you created in Unit 2 in the Azure portal. Select the resource and delete it.

## Next steps

The Digital Twins Definition Language isn't exclusive to Azure Digital Twins. It's also used in IoT Plug and Play. For more information, refer to the [IoT Plug and Play documentation](/azure/iot-pnp/).

Take your interest further with:

- [Azure Digital Twins documentation](/azure/digital-twins/)
- [Understand twin models in Azure Digital Twins](/azure/digital-twins/concepts-models)
- [Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)](/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md)
- [Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs](/azure/digital-twins/how-to-use-apis-sdks)

And look for additional Learn modules that take the chocolate factory scenario further.
