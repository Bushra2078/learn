Congratulations, you've completed all the development and testing work for this module! The following unit summarizes what you've learned.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an instance of Azure Digital Twins (ADT) using the Azure portal
- Create digital models for the production line of a chocolate factory in DTDL
- Validate the digital models using the DTDL Validator sample
- Create a graph of the models using the ADT Explorer sample
- Query the graph using SQL-like queries

You also learned a bit about chocolate production!

## Clean up

Delete the resources manually by locating the resources in the Azure portal and selecting the delete icon. Delete the following resources you created in Unit 2:

- the Azure Digital Twins instance
- the Azure Active Directory app registration

## Next steps

The DTDL language isn't exclusive to Azure Digital Twins. It's also used in IoT Plug and Play. For more information, refer to [IoT Plug and Play Documentation](/azure/iot-pnp/).

Take your interest further with:

- [Azure Digital Twins Documentation](/azure/digital-twins/)
- [Understand twin models in Azure Digital Twins](/azure/digital-twins/concepts-models)
- [Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)](/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md)
- [Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs](/azure/digital-twins/how-to-use-apis-sdks)

And look for additional Learn modules that take the chocolate factory scenario further.
