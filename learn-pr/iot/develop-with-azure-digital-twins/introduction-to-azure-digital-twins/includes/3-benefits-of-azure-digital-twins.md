Using the power of IoT, we have connected and monitored individual assets and machines for quite some time now. IoT has made it possible to bridge the gap between design models and real-world products, improving products and customer experiences. This really involves multiple types of digital twins. For example:

- Digital twins of factory lines improve operation of the factory.
- Many customers have started building digital twins of each product they make and ship. Product twins can help designers and manufacturers to gain a view of the entire product lifecycle, literally from the drawing board to the recycling bin.

In the next phase of digital twins, we will take these capabilities beyond engineering optimization, beyond assets and enable customers to create rich models of entire business environments, and eventually networks of businesses. These comprehensive digital twins will combine traditional business data with a comprehensive model of many different aspects of reality in a single pane of glass, as a transparent model of a business, driving operations, analytics, and simulation.

However, **modeling and creating a digital representation of these environments can be difficult for even the most sophisticated business.**

Today, modeling connected environments is complicated as it spans devices, places, business systems, people and more. With siloed data across all these, it is a challenge to capture actionable insights. Building digital twins solutions involves stitching together a lot of building blocks such as modeling, storage, event systems, etc. Doing this in a scalable and secure manner is time consuming.

It’s hard to keep digital twins up to date with changes from the real world and react to changes as they happen to keep customer experiences relevant and fresh.

Microsoft launched the Azure Digital Twins service to overcome these obstacles and to:

- **Create comprehensive digital models of entire environments**
  
    Gain insights that help you drive better products, optimize operations and costs, and create breakthrough customer experiences. Apply your domain expertise on top of Azure Digital Twins to build connected solutions. Model any environment and bring digital twins to life in a scalable and highly secure manner.

- **Track the past and help predict the future of any connected environment**

    Easily model and create digital representations of connected environments with an open modeling language. Model buildings, factories, farms, energy networks, railways, stadiums—even entire cities. Bring these digital twins to life with a live execution environment, building dynamic business logic and data processing on a robust event system. Unlock actionable insights with powerful query APIs, and seamlessly integrate with Azure data, analytics, and AI services.

- **Break down silos within connected environments** 

    Model any physical environment that’s important to your business. Then connect inputs from IoT devices that are using Azure IoT Hub or from any business system to establish a single live integration layer that delivers insights from across the entire environment.

- **Build on a trusted enterprise-grade platform**  

    Build enterprise-grade IoT connected solutions with the compliance, security, and privacy benefits that Microsoft Azure is known for. Monitor, manage, and update IoT devices with high-level security and scalability through integration with Azure IoT Hub. Manage access and identity with features like role-based access control (RBAC) and Azure Active Directory.
