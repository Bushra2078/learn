As companies navigate their business transformations, they unlock new use cases.

The need to model the whole enterprise is becoming more evident. Azure Digital Twins allows companies to create comprehensive models of their complete business, inclusive of the processes, people, and products. These models give them a true end-to-end view of their enterprise.

Think of a customer that is able to model not only their factories, but also their suppliers and resellers. Modeling would allow them to further automate their operations. For example, they could capture the signal from their users’ experiences or in-store demands and tie them in real time to the production line, to have visibility of the production capacity and capability to meet the demand. They could even take it one step further by closing the loop with supplier of the raw materials required to meet the demand in the specific timeline. This provides better visibility of the product and its traceability.

On the other hand, Azure Digital Twins service is bridging the gap between the inception and engineering of any product and its operations. With digital twins and simulations, customers can do what-if analysis on their products, testing situations before they even occur. For example, before ordering a whole a new part of an expensive asset, customers could simulate the impact of a change in the configuration or a repair. Coupled with AI and process automation, this gets us to true self-healing assets and advanced root cause analysis.

With Azure Digital Twins, customers gain insights that drive better products, optimization of operations, cost reduction and improve customer experiences across all environments.

## Customer examples

:::image type="content" source="../media/ge-aviation-example.png" alt-text="GE Aviation Digital Group example of using Azure Digital Twins" lightbox="../media/ge-aviation-example.png":::

GE Aviation is using Azure Digital Twins to combine data from two disparate systems for creating a living replica of an aircraft. One system keeps track of the performance of an aircraft when it’s in the air. The other system keeps track of everything that happens to an aircraft once it lands on the ground. Currently it’s a manual process to connect the data from these systems for auditing and tracking purposes.

With the new system in place, GE Aviation will have a living database that tracks the performance of an airplane.

Moving beyond tracking the performance of an aircraft in its current configuration, GE Aviation is using Azure Digital Twins to model and maintain a record of each component and part of the aircraft. They will be able to see previous aircraft a part was on, the performance of the part on each  aircraft, the maintenance of the part on the previous aircraft and the performance of the part on the current aircraft.

This new insight into the historical performance of the components of an aircraft will help them identify potential issues, diagnose current issues, and ultimately decrease the cost of maintaining the aircraft.

Telstra has selected Microsoft as a strategic partner in the design and build of a scalable and unified Azure IoT platform enabling Telstra to simplify operations and significantly reduce time to market.

Using its technology services provider, Telstra Purple, Telstra is working together with Microsoft to provide an advanced digital twin solution for Downer Group’s asphalt plants. This "digital asphalt plant" provides greater efficiency, reliability, and safety while at the same time increasing operational transparency and control. The solution identifies and tracks dangerous activity across the plant. Downer also explores scenarios like asset monitoring and chute detection to avoid future incidents.

Physics-based simulation has long been an essential part of the product design process, helping engineers to optimize and validate design choices.

With the broad deployment of IoT sensors in products and their environment, it is now possible to apply the same simulation technology after a product has been built, shipped, and deployed in the field.  Simulation technology can be used to optimize performance and energy usage or predict failures in a highly accurate and immediate way, without the complexities associated with alternative techniques.

ANSYS is the market leader in technical simulation software. ANSYS Twin Builder lets engineers quickly deliver real-time simulation models for operational use. With Microsoft’s Azure Digital Twins platform, it is now possible to efficiently integrate the simulation-based twins into a broader IoT solution.

:::image type="content" source="../media/brookfield-example.png" alt-text="Brookfield example of using Azure Digital Twins" lightbox="../media/brookfield-example.png":::

Brookfield was interested in exploring digital twin technology to create a virtual model of the One Manhattan West (OMW) connected directly to infrastructure, equipment, and systems. This technology would enable Brookfield to transform the building into an intelligent network of digitally connected spaces, combining systems across retail, office, hospitality, and residential environments.

The digital twin enables Brookfield and the tenants of OMW to optimize their energy usage, creating a more sustainable building. By optimizing systems and equipment—for example, proactively servicing HVAC equipment before it breaks down—Brookfield ensures they waste less energy on a daily basis. And analysis of data over time gives operators insight into how they can make environmentally impactful decisions, such as reducing the number of lights needed on certain floors during a Friday afternoon. A reduction in energy cost corresponds to a measurable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
