[Digital Twin Consortium (DTC)](https://www.digitaltwinconsortium.org/index.htm), cofounded by Microsoft, Dell, Ansys, Autodesk, GE Software, Northrop Grumman, and Lendlease, was announced in May 2020 at Build conference. DTC is a fast-growing organization that started with 14 founding members and added 42 members in the first week. It has 125+ partners as of August 2020.

Digital Twin Consortium is a program of Object Management Group dedicated to the widespread adoption of digital twin technology and the value it delivers. Through cross-industry collaboration, the Consortium will help enterprises maximize the benefits of digital twin technology - sharing within a member ecosystem the lessons learned and opportunities uncovered within the virtual world and applying them to the physical world.

Through collaboration, Digital Twin Consortium will:

- Influence the direction of digital twin technology development.
- Become the focal point for digital twin thought leadership, trend analysis, and industry perspective.
- Create cross-industry digital twin reference architectures and definitions.
- Promote, evolve, and refine digital twin best practices and benefits.
- Provide the definitive resource hub for digital twin producers and consumers.
- Improve interoperability between digital twin technologies.

Digital Twin Consortium recognizes the need for technology standards in digital twin innovation but will not develop standards. It will influence standards by deriving requirements that will be submitted to international standards development organizations, such as Object Management Group and ISO/IEC.
