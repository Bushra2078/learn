In this module, you learned how to integrate Azure Digital Twins with Azure Time Series Insights.

The module scenario shows how you can gather and analyze near real-time, historical data about your IoT solution. Azure Digital Twins is a great fit for feeding data into Time Series Insights because it allows you to correlate multiple data streams and standardize your information before sending it to Time Series Insights.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Build and simulate the chocolate factory twin.
- Create a route and filter for twin update notifications.
- Create and configure an Azure function and send telemetry to an event hub.
- Create a Time Series Insights instance and connect it to Azure Digital Twins.
- Visualize and query your data in Time Series Insights.
