Microsoft’s definition of a "Digital Twin" is a digital replica of real-world things, places, business processes or people, designed to understand, model, control, simulate, analyze, and improve real-world business operations. Azure Digital Twins is our IoT Platform enabling the creation of next-generation IoT solutions that model the real world.

The Internet of Things gives businesses unprecedented insights into their assets. As connected solutions continue to evolve, companies are looking to create comprehensive digital models of their entire environments to gain insights that drive better products, optimization of operations, cost reduction, and breakthrough customer experiences.

Azure Digital Twins seamlessly integrates with Azure data, analytics, and AI services to make it easy to track the past and predict the future – giving businesses the edge they need to meet the challenges they face today... and tomorrow.
