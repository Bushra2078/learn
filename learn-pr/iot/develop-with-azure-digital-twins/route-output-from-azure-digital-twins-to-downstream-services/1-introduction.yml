  questions:

  - content: 'Which services are used by event routes to drive your data flows?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Event Hubs, Event Grid, Service Bus'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'An endpoint is a connection to a destination outside of Azure Digital Twins. Supported destinations are Event Hubs, Event Grid, and Service Bus.'
    - content: 'Azure Data Lake, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Logic Apps'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'An endpoint is a connection to a destination outside of Azure Digital Twins. Supported destinations are Event Hubs, Event Grid, and Service Bus.'
    - content: 'Azure Time Series Insights, Azure Maps, Azure Functions'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'An endpoint is a connection to a destination outside of Azure Digital Twins. Supported destinations are Event Hubs, Event Grid, and Service Bus.'

  - content: 'Event routes are defined via data plane APIs. A route definition contains:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'A route ID'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Event routes are defined via data plane APIs. A route definition contains a route ID, an endpoint ID, and a filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint.'
    - content: 'An endpoint ID'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Event routes are defined via data plane APIs. A route definition contains a route ID, an endpoint ID, and a filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint.'
    - content: 'A filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Event routes are defined via data plane APIs. A route definition contains a route ID, an endpoint ID, and a filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint.'
    - content: 'All of the above'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Event routes are defined via data plane APIs. A route definition contains a route ID, an endpoint ID, and a filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint.'
  
  - content: 'The function will send the JSON objects and eventually connect to Time Series Insights by using:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'An IoT hub'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The Azure function will convert twin update events from their original form as JSON Patch documents to JSON objects that contain only updated and added values from your twins. It will then send the JSON objects it creates to an event hub to connect to Time Series Insights.'
