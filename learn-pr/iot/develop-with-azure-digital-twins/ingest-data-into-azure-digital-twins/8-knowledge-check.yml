  questions:

  - content: "What Azure Active Directory role is required to modify Azure Digital Twins?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Digital Twins Data Owner."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Azure Digital Twins Data Owner has full control over Azure Digital Twins resources."
    - content: "Azure Administrator."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure Administrator can create instances of Azure Digital Twin services but can't modify or write."

  - content: "Which of the following can publish data directly to Azure Digital Twins?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Event Grid"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event Grid enables event-based architectures. IoT services such as IoT Hub and Digital Twins can publish their events (that is, messages) to Event Grid."
    - content: "Azure Event Hub"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event Hub is a message ingestion service used to publish or subscribe to messages generated from other services."
    - content: "Azure IoT Hub"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT Hub enables communication with IoT devices and applications.  IoT Hub supports messages routing to various Azure messaging services such as Event Grid and Event Hub."
    - content: "SDK or APIs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Digital Twins supports message ingestion through API calls. Developers can use the REST APIs or the SDKs to interact with the APIs."

  - content: 'What is the recommended pattern for Azure IoT Hub to publish data to Azure Digital Twins in real time?'
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Event Grid and Azure Functions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "IoT Hub can publish telemetry events to Event Grid, which triggers Azure Functions running the Azure Digital Twins SDK. The SDK is used to update Azure Digital Twins."
    - content: "Virtual Machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although virtual machines could be used as 'external compute', this approach would be overly complex and costly."
    - content: "Azure Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT Hub can send telemetry data to Azure Storage. However, this pattern would be complex and wouldn't result in real-time data updates."
    - content: "Azure Pipelines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Pipelines doesn't provide integration with IoT Hub or Digital Twins."
