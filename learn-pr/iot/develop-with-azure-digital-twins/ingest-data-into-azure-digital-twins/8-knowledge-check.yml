  questions:

  - content: "What Azure Active Directory role is required to modify Azure Digital Twins?"
    choices:
    - content: Azure Digital Twins Data Owner."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Gives full access over Azure Digital Twins resources."
    - content: "Azure Administrator."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure Administrator can create instances of Azure Digital Twin services but cannot modify, write, and so on."

  - content: 'Which of the items below can publish data directly to Azure Digital Twins?'
    choices:
    - content: Event Grid
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event Grid enables event-based architectures. IoT services such as IoT Hub and Azure digital twins can publish their events (that is, messages) to Event Grid."
    - content: Event Hub
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event Hub is a message ingestion service used to publish or subscribe to messages generated from other services."
    - content: IoT Hub
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT Hub enables communication with IoT devices and applications.  IoT Hub supports messages routing to various Azure messaging services such as Event Grid and Event Hub."
    - content: SDK / APIs
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Digital Twins support message ingestion through API calls. Developers can use the REST APIs or the SDKs to interact with the APIs."

  - content: 'What is the recommended pattern for IoT Hub to publish data to Azure Digital Twins in real time?'
    choices:
    - content: Event Grid and Azure Functions
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "IoT Hub can publish telemetry events to Event Grid, which triggers Azure Functions running the Azure digital twins SDK. The SDK is used to update Azure digital twins."
    - content: Virtual Machines
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While virtual machines could be used as 'external compute', this would be an overly complex and costly approach."
    - content: Azure Storage
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT Hub can send telemetry data to Azure Storage however this pattern would be complex and would not result in real-time data updates."
    - content: Azure Data Pipeline
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Data Pipeline does not provide integration with IoT Hub or Azure Digital Twins."
