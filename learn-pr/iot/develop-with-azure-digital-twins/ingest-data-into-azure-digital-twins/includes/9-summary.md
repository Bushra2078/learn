This module walked you through deploying the Azure Digital Twins service and creating a Digital Twin of a Grinding Step.  Next, an IoT Hub and Azure Function were created.  Event Grid was configured to send device telemetry from IoT Hub to the Azure Function.  The Azure Digital Twins SDK was used in the Azure Function to publish data to the Grinding Step digital twin.

This module also showed how Logic Apps and the REST APIs could be used to ingest data into Azure Digital Twins. This is useful for bringing data into Azure digital twins from external sources beyond IoT Hub.
