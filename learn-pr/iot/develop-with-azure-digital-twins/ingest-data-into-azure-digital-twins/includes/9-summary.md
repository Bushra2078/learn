This module walked you through deploying the Azure Digital Twins service and creating a digital twin of a Grinding Step. Next, you created an IoT hub and an Azure function app. You configured an Event Grid to send device telemetry from the IoT hub to the function app. And you used the Azure Digital Twins SDK in the function app to publish data to the Grinding Step digital twin.

This module also showed how logic apps and the REST APIs can be used to ingest data into Azure Digital Twins. This technique is useful for bringing data into digital twins from external sources beyond Azure IoT Hub.
