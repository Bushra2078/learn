Congratulations, you've completed all the development and testing work for this module. Let's summarize what you've learned, and finish with a knowledge check.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an instance of Azure Digital Twins (ADT), using the Azure portal
- Create digital models for the production line of a chocolate factory, in DTDL
- Validate the digital models, using the DTDL Validator tool
- Create a graph of the models, using the ADT Explorer Tool
- Query the graph, using SQL-like queries

You also learned a bit about chocolate production!

## Clean up

Sandbox resources will be automatically deleted. 

Delete the resources manually, by locating the resources in the Azure portal, and clicking the delete icon. Delete the following resources you created in Unit 2.

- the Azure Digital Twins instance
- the Azure Active Directory app registration

## Next steps

The DTDL language isn't exclusive to Azure Digital Twins. It's also used in IoT Plug and Play. For more information, refer to [IoT Plug and Play Preview Refresh Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/).

Take your interest further with:

- [Azure Digital Twins Preview Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/)
- [Understand twin models in Azure Digital Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/concepts-models)
- [Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL)](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md)
- [Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs and SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-use-apis-sdks)

And look for additional Learn modules that take the chocolate factory scenario further.

To finish this module and earn your rewards, complete a final knowledge check.
