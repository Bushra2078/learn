  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'The data in your Azure Digital Twins model can be routed to downstream Azure services for additional analytics or storage. What technology is used to provide this data flow?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'IoT Hub'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The telemetry from an IoT Hub can be routed to Azure Digital Twin models, but this is not the technology to route data from the models.
    - content: 'Time Series Insights'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Time Series Insights may be the destination of the data flow, but is not the technology used to route the data.
    - content: 'Azure Data Lake'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An Azure Data Lake might be used to store digital twins data, but is not the technology used to route data.
    - content: 'Event routes'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Event routes, which use Event Hub, Event Grid, or Service Bus, are used to drive your data flows.


  - content: 'An event route lets you send event data from digital twins in Azure Digital Twins to custom-defined endpoints. What Azure services are currently supported for endpoints?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Event Hub, Event Grid, and Service Bus.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Each of these Azure services can be connected to other services and acts as the middleman, sending data along to final destinations such as TSI or Azure Maps for whatever processing you need.
    - content: 'Event Hub, Time Series Insights'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Time Series Insights (TSI) is a final destination of event data, but is not supported for endpoints.
    - content: 'Event Hub, Service Bus'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: At least one service is missing from this list.
    - content: 'Event Hub, Event Grid, Azure Maps'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Two of these services do handle endpoints.
    - content: 'No current Azure services support endpoints.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Several services support endpoints.


   - content: 'What options do you have to create event routes?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Digital Twins APIs, Azure Cloud Shell, and via the Azure Portal.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close. But there is a broader option that using the Azure Cloud Shell.
    - content: 'Digital Twins APIs, CLI commands, and via the Azure Portal.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: And note all APIs come in synchronous and asynchronous versions.
    - content: 'C#  APIs, and CLI commands.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The API calls are not C# specific.
    - content: 'Digital Twins APIs, C# APIs, CLI commands, and via the Azure Portal.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There are only three current options.

  - content: 'How can you monitor the use of an event route?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Via the Metrics menu option in the Azure portal.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Routing metrics such as count, latency, and failure rate can be viewed in the Azure portal.
    - content: 'Event routes cannot be monitored directly. You have to monitor the endpoint.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Event routes can certainly be monitored easily.
    - content: 'Via the Activity log menu option in the Azure portal.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The activity log does not maintain event route metrics.
    - content: 'Via a model graph.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A model graph does not provide event route metrics.  

  - content: 'Which architecture description best describes what you built in this module?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Azure Digital Twins instance -> Event Route -> Event Hub Namespace -> Azure Function -> Event Hub Namespace -> Azure Time Series Insights'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The Event Hub Namespace implements a Twins Hub to ingest data, and a Time Series Hub to output data to TSI.
    - content: 'Azure Digital Twins instance -> Event Route -> Event Hub Namespace -> Azure Time Series Insights'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, but missing a step or two.
    - content: 'Azure Digital Twins instance -> Event Route -> IoT Hub -> Azure Function -> IoT Hub -> Azure Time Series Insights'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, but not quite the correct technologies.
    - content: 'Event Route -> Event Hub Namespace -> Azure Function ->  Azure Time Series Insights'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer misses some steps.
    - content: 'Azure Digital Twins instance ->  Azure Time Series Insights'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There are some intermediary steps!

  - content: 'True or false. To view Azure Time Series Insights data, click on the Time Series Insights Explorer URL shown in the instance overview?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'True'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: In the explorer view that opens, you will see your twins from Azure Digital Twins shown on the left.
    - content: 'False'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can visualize time series data by selecting the explorer link.
