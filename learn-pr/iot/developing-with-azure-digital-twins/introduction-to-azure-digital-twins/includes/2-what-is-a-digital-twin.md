Microsoft’s definition of a “Digital Twin” is a digital replica of real-world things, places, business processes or people, designed to understand, control, simulate, analyze and improve real-world business operations. Azure Digital Twins is our IoT Platform enabling the creation for next-generation IoT solutions that model the real world.

The Internet of Things gives businesses unprecedented insights into their assets. As connected solutions continue to evolve, companies are looking to create comprehensive digital models of their entire environments to gain insights that drive better products, optimization of operations, cost reduction and breakthrough customer experiences.

Examples include Buildings, Factories, Farms, Energy Networks, Railways, Stadiums – even entire Cities. Yet modeling and creating a digital representation of an environment can be difficult for even the most sophisticated enterprises.

Azure Digital Twins makes this easy. It enables customers to model an environment and then bring this digital twin to life – scalable and secure. Businesses can connect assets such as IoT devices, as well as existing business systems to Azure Digital Twins. Azure Digital Twins helps break down silos that previously stood in the way of insights, and provides a robust platform to build dynamic business logic on.

Azure Digital Twins seamlessly integrates with Azure data, analytics and AI services to make it easy to track the past and then predict the future – giving businesses the edge they need to meet the challenges they face today… and tomorrow.
