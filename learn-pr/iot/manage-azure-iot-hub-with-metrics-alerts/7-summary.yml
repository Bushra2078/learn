    choices:  
    - content: 'bushels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bushels are a unit of volume.
    - content: 'decibels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Noise is measured in decibels. Noise can cause vibration, but decibels are not used to measure the vibration.
    - content: 'Newtons'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Newtons are a unit of force.
    - content: 'g-forces'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The use of g-forces to measure vibration is common, though not to ISO standards.
