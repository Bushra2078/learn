  questions: 

  - content: 'In the lists of metrics, what does the acronym C2D stand for?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Cloud to Data'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such metric.
    - content: 'Cloud to Device'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: C2D messages are cloud-to-device messages.  
    - content: 'Cost to Device'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such metric.
    - content: 'Cost to Data'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such metric.

  - content: 'When configuring an action, a developer has set the metric to <b>Total device data usage</b>. <b>Operator</b> is set to <b>Greater than</b>, <b>Aggregation type</b> to <b>Total</b>, and <b>Threshold value</b> to 2000. The <b>Aggregation granularity period</b> is 5 minutes, and the <b>Frequency of evaluation</b> is <b>Every 1 Minute</b>. When will this action trigger?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Every one minute the action will test to see if the total data usage for the past 5 minutes exceeds 2000 bytes. If so, the action is triggered.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This answer correctly identifies the purpose of all the action settings.
    - content: 'Every one minute the action will test to see if the total data usage for the past 5 minutes meets or exceeds 2000 bytes. If so, the action is triggered.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Operator used is "Greater than", not "Greater than or equal to".
    - content: 'Every five minutes the action will test to see if the total data usage for the past one minute exceeds 2000 bytes. If so, the action is triggered.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Time periods are confused here.
    - content: 'Every five minutes the action will test to see if the total data usage for the past 5 minutes exceeds 2000 bytes. If so, the action is triggered.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer doesn't take into account the <b>Frequency of evaluation</b> setting.
      
  - content: 'Over a period of time, a metric has the following 10 values: <b>6, 4, 5, 0, 12, -1, -2, 0, 4, 2</b>. What are the Avg, Min, Max, and Sum of these metrics?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Avg = 3.3, Min = -2, Max = 12, Sum = 33'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: If Sum is calculated incorrectly, then so will the average.
    - content: 'Avg = 3, Min = -2, Max = 12, Sum = 30'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Metrics requires some math ability!
    - content: 'Avg = 3, Min = 0, Max = 12, Sum = 30'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There are values lower than zero.
    - content: 'Avg = 2.5, Min = -1, Max = 6, Sum = 25'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All these values are wrong.
