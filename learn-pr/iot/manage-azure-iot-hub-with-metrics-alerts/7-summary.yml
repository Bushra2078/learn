  questions:

  - content: "Mechanical vibration is normally measured as an acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>). But it's sometimes measured in what?"
    choices:  
    - content: 'bushels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bushels are an obsolete unit of volume.
    - content: 'decibels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Noise is measured in decibels. Noise can cause vibration, but decibels aren't used to measure that vibration.
    - content: 'Newtons'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Newtons are units of force.
    - content: 'g-forces'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The use of g-forces to measure vibration is common, though isn't to ISO standards.      

  - content: 'In the context of IoT Hub metrics, what is an <b>action group</b>?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'A collection of A-type individuals'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not in the context of IoT Hub!
    - content: 'A collection of actions of the same type. Such as a group of Webhooks, Azure Functions, or Automation Runbooks?'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Action groups aren't limited to actions of the same type.
    - content: 'A collection of actions, not necessarily of the same type. Such as a mix of Webhooks, Azure Functions, or Automation Runbooks'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: There are limits to the number of each type of action in any one action group. But all available actions can form part of that group.
    - content: 'A collection of metrics, alerts, diagnostics, and logs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no formal collection of these features.

  - content: 'What are the four entries for the IoT Hub <b>Monitoring</b> menu?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Alerts, Metrics, Security Alerts, Custom Alerts'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Security Alerts and Custom Alerts fall under the <b>Security</b> heading.
    - content: 'Alerts, Metrics, Diagnostic settings, Logs'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These entries are the four features of IoT Hub monitoring.
    - content: 'Overview, Alerts, Metrics, Logs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An Overview feature isn't available for Monitoring.
    - content: 'Alerts, Metrics, Diagnostic settings, Resource Health'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Resource Health is a feature of <b>Support + Troubleshooting</b>

  - content: 'In the lists of metrics, what does the acronym C2D stand for?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Cloud to Data'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such metric.
    - content: 'Cloud to Device'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: C2D messages are cloud-to-device messages.  
    - content: 'Cost to Device'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such metric.
    - content: 'Cost to Data'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such metric.

  - content: 'When configuring an action, a developer has set the metric to <b>Total device data usage</b>. <b>Operator</b> is set to <b>Greater than</b>, <b>Aggregation type</b> to <b>Total</b>, and <b>Threshold value</b> to 2000. The <b>Aggregation granularity period</b> is 5 minutes, and the <b>Frequency of evaluation</b> is <b>Every 1 Minute</b>. When will this action trigger?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Every one minute the action will test to see if the total data usage for the past 5 minutes exceeds 2000 bytes. If so, the action is triggered.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This answer correctly identifies the purpose of all the action settings.
    - content: 'Every one minute the action will test to see if the total data usage for the past 5 minutes meets or exceeds 2000 bytes. If so, the action is triggered.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Operator used is "Greater than", not "Greater than or equal to".
    - content: 'Every five minutes the action will test to see if the total data usage for the past one minute exceeds 2000 bytes. If so, the action is triggered.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Time periods are confused here.
    - content: 'Every five minutes the action will test to see if the total data usage for the past 5 minutes exceeds 2000 bytes. If so, the action is triggered.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer doesn't take into account the <b>Frequency of evaluation</b> setting.
      
  - content: 'Over a period of time, a metric has the following 10 values: <b>6, 4, 5, 0, 12, -1, -2, 0, 4, 2</b>. What are the Avg, Min, Max, and Sum of these metrics?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Avg = 3.3, Min = -2, Max = 12, Sum = 33'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: If Sum is calculated incorrectly, then so will the average.
    - content: 'Avg = 3, Min = -2, Max = 12, Sum = 30'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Metrics requires some math ability!
    - content: 'Avg = 3, Min = 0, Max = 12, Sum = 30'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There are values lower than zero.
    - content: 'Avg = 2.5, Min = -1, Max = 6, Sum = 25'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All these values are wrong.
