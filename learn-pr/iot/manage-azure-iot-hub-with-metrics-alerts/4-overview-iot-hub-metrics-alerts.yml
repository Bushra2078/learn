  questions:

  - content: "Mechanical vibration is normally measured as an acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>). But it's sometimes measured in what?"
    choices:  
    - content: 'bushels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bushels are an obsolete unit of volume.
    - content: 'decibels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Noise is measured in decibels. Noise can cause vibration, but decibels aren't used to measure that vibration.
    - content: 'Newtons'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Newtons are units of force.
    - content: 'g-forces'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The use of g-forces to measure vibration is common, though isn't to ISO standards.      

  - content: 'In the context of IoT Hub metrics, what is an <b>action group</b>?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'A collection of A-type individuals'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not in the context of IoT Hub!
    - content: 'A collection of actions of the same type. Such as a group of Webhooks, Azure Functions, or Automation Runbooks?'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Action groups aren't limited to actions of the same type.
    - content: 'A collection of actions, not necessarily of the same type. Such as a mix of Webhooks, Azure Functions, or Automation Runbooks'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: There are limits to the number of each type of action in any one action group. But all available actions can form part of that group.
    - content: 'A collection of metrics, alerts, diagnostics, and logs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no formal collection of these features.

  - content: 'What are the four entries for the IoT Hub <b>Monitoring</b> menu?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Alerts, Metrics, Security Alerts, Custom Alerts'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Security Alerts and Custom Alerts fall under the <b>Security</b> heading.
    - content: 'Alerts, Metrics, Diagnostic settings, Logs'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These entries are the four features of IoT Hub monitoring.
    - content: 'Overview, Alerts, Metrics, Logs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An Overview feature isn't available for Monitoring.
    - content: 'Alerts, Metrics, Diagnostic settings, Resource Health'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Resource Health is a feature of <b>Support + Troubleshooting</b>
