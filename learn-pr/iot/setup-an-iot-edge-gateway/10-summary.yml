  questions:

  - content: 'Which IoT Edge Gateway configuration patterns are best used for legacy devices which do not have support for MQTT/AMQP/HTTP?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Transparent and Protocol Translation'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Transparent Gateway configuration requires that downstream devices support MQTT, AMQP, or HTTP.
    - content: 'Transparent, Protocol Translation, and Identity Translation'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Transparent Gateway configuration requires that downstream devices support MQTT, AMQP, or HTTP.
    - content: 'Identity Translation and Protocol Translation'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Both of these services allow for translation of legacy data protocols.

  - content: 'When configuring `config.yaml` for an IoT Edge Gateway Device, which X.509 certificate settings correspond to the certificate used by the downstream device for secure authentication?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'device_ca_cert'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This is the Device CA Certificate for the IoT Edge Device.
    - content: 'device_ca_pk'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is the Device CA Private Key for the IoT Edge Device.
    - content: 'trusted_ca_certs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is the Root CA Certificate. This certificate must contain all the trusted CA certificates required for Edge module communications.

  - content: 'What is the port number designated for MQTT transport on IoT Edge devices'
    choices: 
    - content: '443'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Port 443 is the designated port used for HTTPS, MQTT + WS, and AMQP + WS transport on IoT Edge Devices.
    - content: '5671'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Port 5671 is the designated port used for AMQP transport on IoT Edge Devices.
    - content: '8883'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Port 8883 is the designated port used for MQTT transport on IoT Edge Devices.

  - content: 'What Azure Resource do we use to configure inbound and outbound port access to Azure Virtual Machines?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The IP Configurator'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is a fictitious Azure Resource.
    - content: 'The IoT Edge configuration file (config.yaml)'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The IoT Edge configuration file specifies the authentication mechanisms and other properties available to devices that have the IoT Edge runtime installed.  It does not have any control over port access rules.
    - content: 'Network Security Group'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Input and Output rules are created and defined in the Network Security Group resource associated to the Azure Virtual Machine.

  - content: 'When configuring a downstream device to communicate with IoT Hub through an IoT Edge Gateway, the device must be configured to support which of the following? '
    choices: 
    - content: 'Parent device'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A parent device configuration is required for communication from a downstream device to an IoT Edge Gateway.
    - content: 'Authentication type'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All IoT Edge devices require an Authentication type to be set, whether using an IoT Edge Gateway or directly connecting to an IoT Hub from the device itself.

  - content: 'What values make up the device connection string for a Downstream Device?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'DeviceId, SharedAccessKey, and GatewayHostName'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The DownStream Device's HostName is also part of it's device connection string.
    - content: 'HostName, DeviceId, SharedAccessKey, and GatewayHostName'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: All of these values are required to properly authenticate a Downstream Device with a connection string.
    - content: 'IP address, DeviceId, SharedAccessKey, and GatewayHostName'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The DownStream Device's ip address is not part of it's device connection string.
