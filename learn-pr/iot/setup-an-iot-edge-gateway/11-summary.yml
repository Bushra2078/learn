  questions:

  - content: 'When configuring `config.yaml` for an IoT Edge Gateway Device, which X.509 certificate settings correspond to the certificate used by the downstream device for secure authentication?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'device_ca_cert'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This is the Device CA Certificate for the IoT Edge Device.
    - content: 'device_ca_pk'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is the Device CA Private Key for the IoT Edge Device.
    - content: 'trusted_ca_certs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is the Root CA Certificate. This certificate must contain all the trusted CA certificates required for Edge module communications.

  - content: 'What is the port number designated for MQTT transport on IoT Edge devices'
    choices: 
    - content: '443'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Port 443 is the designated port used for HTTPS, MQTT + WS, and AMQP + WS transport on IoT Edge Devices.
    - content: '5671'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Port 5671 is the designated port used for AMQP transport on IoT Edge Devices.
    - content: '8883'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Port 8883 is the designated port used for MQTT transport on IoT Edge Devices.
      
  - content: 'When configuring a downstream device to communicate with IoT Hub through an IoT Edge Gateway, the device must be configured to support which of the following? '
    choices: 
    - content: 'Parent device'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A parent device configuration is required for communication from a downstream device to an IoT Edge Gateway.
    - content: 'Authentication type'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All IoT Edge devices require an Authentication type to be set, whether using an IoT Edge Gateway or directly connecting to an IoT Hub from the device itself.
