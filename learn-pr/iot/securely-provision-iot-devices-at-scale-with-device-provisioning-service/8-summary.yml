  title: Check your knowledge
  questions: 

  - content: 'What does DPS stand for?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Device Provisioning System'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, but no.
    - content: 'Device Provisioning Service'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The service can be linked to one, or more, IoT Hubs.
    - content: 'Device Provisioning Security'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, but no.
    - content: 'Device Possession Service'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, but no.

  - content: 'What is the process of verifying X.509 certificates known as?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Proof of Possession'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Proof of Possession of the CA certificate is provided to DPS by uploading a certificate generated from the CA certificate with a verification code. This process is how you provide proof that you own the CA Certificate.
    - content: 'Generate Verification Code'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Generating a verification code is part of the process, but not the name for the complete process.
    - content: 'Add certificate'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Adding a certificate to a DPS service doesn't verify the certificate.
    - content: 'Enrollment'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Individual or group enrollments can be created, but enrolling isn't the verification process.

  - content: 'All devices connecting to Azure DPS will be configured with this Global Device Endpoint?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The setting for ID Scope'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This value identifies the DPS service and IoT Hub.
    - content: 'global.azure-devices-provisioning.net'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: All IoT devices connected to Azure use this endpoint.
    - content: 'Your DPS endpoint'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This endpoint doesn't apply to all devices.
    - content: 'The setting for SecurityProviderX509'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This variable is used
       in the code, and isn't related to a global endpoint.

  - content: 'Which allocation policy for Azure IoT DPS systems is the default?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Lowest latency: This policy assigns devices to the linked IoT Hub, which will result in the lowest latency communications between device and IoT Hub.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not the default. This policy might work well if several IoT Hubs are in your system.
    - content: 'Evenly weighted distribution: This policy evenly distributes devices across the linked IoT Hubs.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This policy is the default, and the right one to use with a single IoT Hub.
    - content: 'Static configuration: This policy requires a desired IoT Hub be listed in the enrollment entry for a device to be provisioned.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not the default. This policy enables a specified IoT Hub to be used for specific devices.


  - content: 'Each Group Enrollment requires one root X.509 certificate. What single certificate is chained to the root certificate?'
    choices:
    - content: 'A leaf certificate'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Multiple leaf certificates can be created for one root certificate.
    - content: 'An intermediate certificate'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Multiple intermediate certificates can be created for one root certificate.
    - content: 'A self-signed certificate'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Self-signing is a mechanism for verifying the certificates.
    - content: 'A verification certificate'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Generating a verification code helps ensure proof of possession.

  - content: 'Passwords in our sample code are hard-coded, certificates are stored locally. What system should be used for production-ready passwords and certificates?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The password could be held in an Azure Key Vault, and the certificate pfx file stored in a Hardware Security Module.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: There are alternative secure mechanisms, but this approach is secure.
    - content: 'The process in the sample is fine for production.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, it isn't.
    - content: 'Both password and certificate could be held in a Hardware Security Module (HSM).'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Hardware Security Module might not be the best location for a password.
    - content: 'Passwords and certificates are secure, and can be stored in the clear.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No!
    - content: 'The certificate pfx file could be held in an Azure Key Vault, and the password stored in a Hardware Security Module.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not quite, the best storage for certificates and passwords is reversed in this answer.

  - content: 'X.509 certificates validate your identity, and secure your data through encryption. What is one disadvantage of using these certificates?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The need to distribute public keys, or fingerprints, when creating valid key pairs.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no need to distribute public keys with X.509 certification.
    - content: 'Authentication can be revoked.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Revocation is an advantage, not a disadvantage, of X.509 certificates.
    - content: 'Lower level of security than public key encryption.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, the level of security is equal to, or greater than, public key encryption.
    - content: 'Requires a public-key infrastructure.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This requirement can increase the initial cost of deployment.
    - content: "Use of these certificates isn't scalable."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: X.509 certificates are highly scalable.
    - content: 'Requires secret private keys for identity verification.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Secret private keys are an advantage, not a disadvantage, of X.509 certificates.
    - content: 'Can be used for many purposes: access to servers, login attempts, single or multiple devices.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Flexibility is an advantage, not a disadvantage, of X.509 certificates.
    - content: "With leaf, intermediate, and root certificates, and several signing mechanisms, they're complex to understand and use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's a complexity to security, but this complexity isn't unique to X.509 certificates, and can't be considered much of a disadvantage.


  - content: 'Take a guess at the weaknesses of self-signed certificates?'
    choices:
    - content: '1. Low-level hash or cypher technologies might have been used to create the certificates.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Low-quality encryption may well be true of the free tools you might use to create the certificates. However, low-quality encryption isn't the only possible weakness.
    - content: '2. The lifetime of a self-signed certificate is often set at one year, which may interrupt your production process.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Setting a short expiry time might well become a nuisance. A short expiry time isn't the only weakness.
    - content: "3. Self-signed certificates aren't trusted by other apps, operating systems, or cloud resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Lack of trust isn't the only weakness.
    - content: '4. Self-signed certificates are sometimes referred to as "snake oil certificates", to express their untrustworthiness.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The nickname is true, but nicknames aren't in themselves a weakness.
    - content: 'All the above.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not quite.
    - content: '1 to 3 of the above.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Use CA certificates in a production environment.
    - content: 'None of the above.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not in the real world.


  - content: 'Which of the following statements is true?'
    choices:
    - content: 'A root, intermediate, or leaf certificate can be used to validate a device.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Root and intermediate certificates can't be used to validate devices.
    - content: 'A root, intermediate, or leaf certificate can be used to sign other certificates.  Only a leaf certificate can be used to validate a device.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Leaf certificates can't be used to sign other certificates.
    - content: 'A root certificate can only be used to sign other certificates. An intermediate, or leaf, certificate can be used to validate devices.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Intermediate certificates can't be used to validate devices.
    - content: 'A root, or intermediate, certificate can only be used to sign other certificates. A leaf certificate can be used to validate multiple devices.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A leaf certificate can only validate one device.
    - content: 'A root, or intermediate, certificate can only be used to sign other certificates. Only a leaf certificate can be used to validate a device.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: One root certificate signing multiple leaf certificates is a good scenario for a DPS Group Enrollment.
