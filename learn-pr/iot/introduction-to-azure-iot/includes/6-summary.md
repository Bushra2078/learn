<!-- 1. Goal and criteria-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Recap that this module's goal is 'evaluate' using the provided decision criteria.

    Format: Short text followed by a bulleted list of the decision criteria developed in the "When to use (product)" unit.

    Heading: none

    Example: "Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Logic Apps would be a good choice for your business process. We developed some criteria you can use to guide your decision:
    * Integration
    * Performance
    * Conditionals
    * Connectors"

-->
Now that you've completed this module, you can decide whether the Azure IoT services are appropriate to your specific IoT scenario:

- Do the Azure IoT services provide the capabilities you need to implement your solution?
- Do you understand the architecture of a typical IoT solution?
- Do you have the skills to implement your solution using the Azure IoT services?



<!-- 2. Show how you solved the scenario problem(s)---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Briefly summarize how you applied the decision criteria to the scenario problem(s). Ideally, discuss two scenarios, one where the product was appropriate and one where it wasn't.

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "We applied these criteria to our fictional shoe company. The analysis helped us see how difficult it would be to use Logic Apps for each process. Both the social-media monitor and the video archive utility used only the built-in connectors. This characteristic made them perfect for Logic Apps. The online sales portal required more work because it had complex conditionals and needed custom connectors."
 -->

You could use either IoT Central or a custom solution that uses IoT Hub to create a connected coffee machine solution. Using IoT Central would let you build the solution quickly, a custom solution would let you tailor the solution to your exact requirements. In both scenarios you need to implement the device code for your connected coffee machine.

<!-- 3. Describe the business impact ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: explain how choosing the right product is important

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "The criteria help you evaluate whether your business processes are a good match for Logic Apps. First, they let you assess how well Logic Apps will solve your problem. Second, they give you an idea of the amount of customization effort involved in using them for your task. This process should give you enough information to choose the right product for your work."

Building an IoT solution for your connected coffee machine will help you to:

- Manage your coffee machines remotely.
- Monitor the status of your coffee machines.
- Automate business processes such as notifying the maintenance department when a coffee machine needs servicing.

<!-- 4. References (optional) ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide a few recommendations for further study via a bulleted list of links. This is optional and intended to be used sparingly.        
        - use descriptive link text so you don't need to include other text such as a description
        - prefer other first-party sites like Docs reference pages
        - generally avoid linking to other Learn training content ("next steps" recommendations are generated automatically)
        - link to third-party sites only when they are trusted and authoritative
        - avoid linking to opinion sites such as blog posts

    Heading: "## References"

    Example:
        "## References
          * [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles)
          * [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)
          * [Manage access to billing information for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-access)"
