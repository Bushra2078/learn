## Overview

You've created seven ThreadX projects, you've used a mutex, a counting semaphore, an event flags group, and a message queue in several projects. Would you like to know more about priority inversion? Are you concerned about the possibility of priority inversion causing your system to crash? Would you like to know about techniques that can help you avoid this problem? If so, this module is the one you should investigate.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand the dangers of priority inversion.
- Understand how to use priority inheritance to avoid priority inversion problems.
- Understand how to use preemption threshold to avoid priority inversion problems.
- Understand the differences between these two solutions to the priority inversion problem.
- Design and debug a ThreadX solution using a hands-on approach with GitHub Codespace or Visual Studio.
- Study the priority inversion problem, and compare the priority inheritance and preemption threshold solutions.

After you complete this module, you'll be well on your way to mastering ThreadX.
