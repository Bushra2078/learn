Your team is responsible for monitoring IoT Hub and troubleshooting device connection and communication issues for the company's IoT solution.

You learned how to configure IoT Hub monitoring diagnostics, metrics, alerts, and logging.

If you and your company didn't research IoT Hub monitoring, you wouldn't be prepared to set up monitoring diagnostics, metrics, alerts, and logging.

The experience that you gained by configuring IoT Hub metrics, alerts, and logging in a test environment helps you to support your company's monitoring and troubleshooting goals.
