Your team will be responsible for monitoring IoT Hub and troubleshooting device connection and communication issues for the company's IoT solution.

You learned how to configure IoT Hub monitoring diagnostics, metrics, alerts, and logging.

If you and your company had not learned about IoT Hub monitoring, you would not be prepared to set up monitoring diagnostics, metrics, alerts, and logging.

The experience that you have gained by configuring IoT Hub metrics, alerts, and logging in a test environment will help you to support your company's monitoring and troubleshooting goals.
