Running a new app for the first time is always an anxious and exiting time!

## Test the cross country app

1. Locate the HTML file in your **Documents** folder. Double click on it.

1. Do you get a view of the world, with the app banner? If not, go back and carefully check you completed the previous unit correctly.

1. Without further ado, click **Go**. You should see the truck and car route appear quickly.

1. Wait a few seconds, and the green bicycle route appears.

1. If you get the image above, good work! It's all plain sailing from now on.

1. You will notice that the car route in purple, and the truck route, in xxx, are nearly identical, but diverge by N km. So where are the extra N km? Try zooming in and out to find the divergence. Hint: check the big cities!
