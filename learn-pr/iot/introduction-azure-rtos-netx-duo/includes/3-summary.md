# Overview

We discussed several important terms and concepts in this module, as they're related to NetX Duo. Following are brief definitions of some key points.

## TCP/IP stack

The TCP/IP stack is a four-layer model that consists of a series of protocols, each performing a specific operation.

## Protocol

A protocol is a set of established rules and procedures that enables devices to use the Internet to communicate and share information.

## Application layer

The application layer establishes the connection between data and the application.

## Transport layer

The transport layer is responsible for managing the flow of data between hosts on the network.

## Network layer

The network layer is sometimes called the Internet layer, and it's responsible for sending and receiving simple packets across the network.

## Link layer

The link level is handled by the network driver, and is typically targeted towards Ethernet.
