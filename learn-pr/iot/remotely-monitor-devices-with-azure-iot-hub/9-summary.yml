  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "What does the following line of code require that you have done: var DeviceClient = require('azure-iot-device').Client?"
    choices:  
    - content: 'Requires that you have created an IoT Hub, using the Azure IoT portal.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You create an IoT Hub, but that is not required by the line of code shown above.
    - content: 'Requires that you have assigned an ID to an IoT Hub device.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You create an IoT Hub device, but that is not required by the line of code shown above.
    - content: 'Requires that you have installed the npm package "azure-iot-device".'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This line of code creates an object based on the Client instance, defined in the npm package "azure-iot-device".

  - content: "What is the role of the string 'SetTelemetryInterval' in the following line of code (running on an IoT Hub device): client.onDeviceMethod('SetTelemetryInterval', onSetTelemetryInterval)?"
    choices:  
    - content: 'It is a descriptive name to appear in system metrics.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The onDeviceMethod does not require any descriptive names.
    - content: 'It is the name of the method running in the device Node.js app.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The name of the method running in the device app is the second parameter (onSetTelemetryInterval).  
    - content: 'It is the methodName parameter that will be sent from IoT Hub, when the onSetTelemetryInterval method is to be run.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The 'SetTelemetryInterval' parameter is important, as it must exactly match the method parameters specified in the backend app.
    - content: 'It is a built-in method when coding Node.js console apps.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Node.js does not have a concept of telemetry.

  - content: 'What is the role of an IoT Hub device twin?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'A device twin is a copy of the device state information, held on the device itself.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Device twins are stored in the cloud.
    - content: 'Device twins are duplicate hardware devices, in case one device malfunctions.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Duplicating devices may be a sensible approach, but they are not called IoT Hub device twins.
    - content: 'Device twins are JSON documents that store, in the cloud, device information.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure IoT Hub, by default, maintains a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub. State information includes metadata, configuration settings, and conditions.
