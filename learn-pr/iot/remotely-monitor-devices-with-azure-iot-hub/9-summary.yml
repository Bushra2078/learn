  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "What library must you load for the device app to work?"
    choices:  
    - content: 'Chalk'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This library will help prettify your console output, but that is not a requirement for a device app.
    - content: 'For Node.js - azure-iot-device, or for C# - Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These libraries help create an IoT device client.
    - content: 'For Node.js - @azure/event-hubs, or for C# - Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These libraries are required by the back-end app, not the device app.

  - content: "Only one of the following statements is true, which one?"
    choices:  
    - content: 'The name of a direct method in the device app appears as a string in the back-end app'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: In our sample, 'SetFanState' appears in both apps to identify the direct method.
    - content: 'Device twin tags are data shared with the IoT device'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Tags are not shared, and are not visible to the device.  
    - content: 'A direct method can contain zero, or one, parameter'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Direct methods include a payload that can contain many parameters.
    - content: 'To create a device twin, a single line of code is required.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Device twins are created by default, no lines of code are required.

  - content: 'What is the role of an IoT Hub device twin?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'A device twin is a copy of the device state information, held on the device itself.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Device twins are stored in the cloud.
    - content: 'Device twins are duplicate hardware devices, in case one device malfunctions.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Duplicating devices may be a sensible approach, but they are not called IoT Hub device twins.
    - content: 'Device twins are JSON documents that store, in the cloud, device information.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure IoT Hub, by default, maintains a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub. State information includes metadata, configuration settings, and conditions.
