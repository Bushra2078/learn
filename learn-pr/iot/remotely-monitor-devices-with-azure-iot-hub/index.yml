title: Remotely monitor and control devices with Azure IoT Hub
summary: >
  Create an IoT Hub device app, and a back-end service app. As a scenario, we use the monitoring, and controlling, of the temperature and humidity of a cheese cave. 
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Create an Azure IoT Hub, using the IoT Hub portal
  - Create an Azure IoT Hub device identity, using the IoT Hub portal
  - Create an app to send device telemetry to the IoT Hub
  - Create a second app to listen for the telemetry, and control the device through direct methods and device twins
prerequisites: | 
  - An introductory knowledge of Azure IoT
  -	Ability to navigate the Azure IoT portal 
  -	Ability to use Node.js, or C#, at the beginner level
