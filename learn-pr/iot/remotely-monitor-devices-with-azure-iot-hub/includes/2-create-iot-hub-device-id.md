In this unit, we'll first create an IoT Hub, and add a single device to that hub. Then we record the connection strings we need for the coding sections of this module.

## Create a custom IoT Hub

1. Make sure you've activated the sandbox using the button above. The sandbox creates a free temporary Azure subscription.
1. Right-click on [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), and select **Open in new window**.
1. Select **+ Create a resource**, from the top of the left-hand menu. In the **Search the Marketplace** search box, enter "IoT Hub".
1. Select **IoT Hub** from the search results, and click **Create**.
1. You'll be required to enter a **Subscription** from the selection offered to you. A sandbox subscription will be **Concierge Subscription**, so choose that. For **Resource Group**, select or enter <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>. A resource group is similar to a folder. It's largely there to help you organize your resources.
1. Enter a friendly name (say "CheeseCaveHub-&lt;your ID&gt;") for **IoT hub Name**.
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >Your hub names are publicly discoverable, so take this into account when entering names. Hub names must also be unique, as they form part of the Azure URL.
1. For **Region**, ensure the selection is a geographical region close to your location.
1. Select the **Management** tab to view the capabilities of your hub. You can leave all entries at their default settings. If you wish, you can change **Pricing and scale tier** to **F1: Free tier**, although you'll not be charged if you leave the tier at **S1: Standard tier**, as sandbox resources are free. 

    > [!TIP]
    > Under **Advanced Settings**, note the number of partitions. A single _partition_ has a maximum number of concurrent readers processing data. In our cheese cave scenario, we only have one reader (the back-end service app), so the default selection is fine. However, if high telemetry throughput is an issue, increasing the number of partitions, and number of concurrent connected readers, will aid in increasing efficiency.

1. Now, select **Review + create**. This option gives you a chance to verify your choices before clicking **Create** and building the hub. Building your hub can take a few minutes.
1. Click **Go to resource** to go to the home page for your new IoT hub.
1. It's a good idea to bookmark the home page of your IoT Hub.

## Create an IoT Hub device identity

Now we need to create a single device identity, the sensor monitoring the cheese cave.

1. On the home page of your hub, Select **Explorers > IoT devices** in the left-hand menu.
1. Click **+ New**.
1. In the **Create a device** screen that follows, enter a **Device ID**, such as "CheeseCaveID". Ensure **Auto-generate keys** and **Connect this device to an IoT Hub** are enabled, and then select **Save**.

1. You should now see your device in the list of devices for the IoT Hub. Select the device name. Copy your **Device ID**, and the **Primary Connection String** to a text file (using Notepad, or similar text editor).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The connection string you've just copied is the _device_ connection string. There are many other connection strings, including the _service_ connection string, that we also will need. Add a note to your text file that this is the device connection string.

1. Navigate back to the **Overview** page for your IoT Hub.

1. In the left-hand menu, select **Settings > Shared access policies**.

1. Click the `iothubowner` entry under **Policy**, then, on the right-hand side, copy the **Connection string-primary key** and paste it into your text file. Again, add a note, this text is the _service_ connection string.

::: zone pivot="csharp"
1. In the left-hand menu, select **Settings > Built-in endpoints**.

1. Under **Event Hub compatible endpoint**, ensure **Shared access policy** is set to `iothubowner`. Copy the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint** to your text file.
::: zone-end

1. Save the text file. Use the file for reference in the next unit.

You've now completed the preparatory work for this module, the next steps are all coding and testing. Before we advance though, a quick knowledge check!
