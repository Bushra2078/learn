We discussed several important terms and concepts in this module, as they're related to Azure ThreadX RTOS. Following are brief definitions of some key points.

### Producer-Consumer problem

Classic multi-thread synchronization problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem).

### Counting semaphore

ThreadX resource that contains a non-negative integer with two operations. The `put` operation increments the semaphore, and the `get` operation decrements the semaphore, but the semaphore count can never be less than zero. 

### Binary semaphore

A counting semaphore that is initialized to zero, and the semaphore count must never exceed one.

### Sleep

ThreadX service that self-suspends for a specific number of timer ticks.

### Mutex

ThreadX resource used only for mutual exclusion.
