We'll review the four building blocks that form a solution to our problem before we do the exercise in the next unit. You don't need to copy the code in this unit, everything you need is provided in the exercise.

<a name="building-block-1"></a>

## Building block 1

Building Block 1 contains a variety of declarations, definitions, and prototypes: <!--figure 5-->

:::code language="c" source="../code/project-producer-consumer.c" range="1-29" highlight="18,24":::

In the highlighted code we add another Consumer thread, and another counter and prototype.

## Building block 2

Building Block 2 contains the main entry point: <!---figure 6-->

:::code language="c" source="../code/project-producer-consumer.c" range="31-36":::

## Building block 3

Building Block 3, part 1 contains initialization and various application definitions: <!--figure 7-->

:::code language="c" source="../code/project-producer-consumer.c" range="38-55":::

<a name="building-block-3-part-2"></a>

Building Block 3, part 2 contains additional application definitions: <!--figure 8-->

:::code language="c" source="../code/project-producer-consumer.c" range="57-72" highlight="4-7, 11":::

> [!NOTE]
> - You need to add a second Consumer thread. Its entry function should be similar to the one above. 
> - We initialized the counting semaphore to zero, which signifies that StorageFaciltiy is initially empty.

## Building block 4

Building Block 4, part 1 contains the Producer thread entry function: <!--figure 9-->

:::code language="c" source="../code/project-producer-consumer.c" range="74-91":::

> [!NOTE]
> - No changes are needed for the Producer thread entry function. 

Building Block 4, part 2 contains the Consumer thread entry function: <!--figure 10-->

:::code language="c" source="../code/project-producer-consumer.c" range="95-108":::

> [!NOTE]
> - Use this function as a guide to creating the second consumer.

Building Block 4, part 3 contains the printstats application timer entry function: <!--figure 11-->

:::code language="c" source="../code/project-producer-consumer.c" range="110-125" highlight="11-15":::

> [!NOTE]
> - Add a `printf` to display information about the second consumer that you added.
