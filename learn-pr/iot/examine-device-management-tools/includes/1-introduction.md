Azure IoT device management tools provide interactive user interfaces that can be used to perform IoT device management tasks. This includes starting or stopping a device, reading or writing device state information, and firmware updates.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to manage the IoT devices that have been deployed in the field. Understanding the device management options that the team will have available to implement device management tasks will help prepare the team to complete their device management responsibilities.

In this module, you will:

- Review the Azure IoT device management tools and approaches
- Examine device management using Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI
- Examine device management using Visual Studio Code and the Azure IoT Hub extension

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the software tools that are used to implement Azure IoT device management.
