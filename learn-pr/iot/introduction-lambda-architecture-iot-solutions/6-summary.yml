  questions:

  - content: 'What construct does Data Lake Gen 2 storage add to enhance data organization?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Hot and cold paths'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These paths are features of lambda architecture, and are available to all IoT solutions.
    - content: 'Time Series Insights'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Tine Series Insights enhance data visualization, not data organization.    
    - content: 'Hierarchical namespaces'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Hierarchical namespaces can be used to encapsulate data across folders, files, and objects.
    - content: 'Failover regions'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Failover regions are part of disaster recovery.

  - content: 'Which consistency level supports data writes being available immediately in the write-region, but data updates arriving in order, with varying latency, in the read-regions?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Eventual consistency'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Eventual consistency is a free-for-all, where each region has updated information available when it arrives.
    - content: 'Strong consistency '
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: In Strong consistency, all regions must wait until all regions have read access to the latest data.
    - content: 'Session consistency'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Session consistency works for many applications, and is the default.
    - content: 'Bounded consistency'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bounded consistency requires a time limit, or update limit, as a threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the region will wait for less stale data.

  - content: 'What are the three visualizations available in Time Series Insights?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Charts, Heat maps, Tables'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: There are options within each of these types of display, such as line charts and bar charts.
    - content: 'Line charts, Heat maps, Tables'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Charts are not limited to line charts.
    - content: 'Hot maps, cold maps, tables'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such concept as hot or cold maps.
    - content: 'Charts, Heat maps, Telemetry'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Telemetry isn't a form of data visualization.

  - content: 'What is the difference between a failover region, and a secondary read region?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Nothing, they are the same.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Both have their own distinct roles.
    - content: "A failover region takes over primary control, when the primary region fails. A secondary read region receives data updates from the primary region, but can't write data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Failover is only used when a local disaster of some sort occurs. Secondary regions are active all the time.
    - content: 'A failover region takes over primary control, when the primary region fails. A secondary read region reads and writes data.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Read regions do not write data.
    - content: "A failover region is bypassed if a disaster occurs in the primary region. A secondary read region receives data updates from the primary region, but can't write data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Failover regions are not bypassed if a primary region disaster occurs.
