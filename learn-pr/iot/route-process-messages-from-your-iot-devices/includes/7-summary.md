You are responsible for creating a prototype capable of processing and analyzing IoT sensor telemetry data using Azure IoT Hub message routing and Azure Stream Analytics jobs.

You used code to test and validate that the prototype Azure IoT Hub message routing and Azure Stream Analytics jobs capabilities can meet the objecives of your company's planned system upgrade.

If you and your company didn't prototype Azure IoT Hub message routing and Azure Stream Analytics jobs, you wouldn't know if the process would work for your planned system upgrade.

The experience that you gained by implementing the two service technologies in a test environment will help to ensure a successful solution design.
