## Azure Blob storage

Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

Blob storage is ideal for:

* Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
* Storing files for distributed access.
* Streaming video and audio.
* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

Objects in Blob storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. Users or client applications can access blobs via URLs, the Azure Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an Azure Storage client library. The storage client libraries are available for multiple languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, and Ruby.

## Types of storage accounts

Azure Storage offers several types of storage accounts. Each type supports different features and has its own pricing model. Consider these differences before you create a storage account to determine the type of account that is best for your applications. The types of storage accounts are:

* General-purpose v2 accounts: Basic storage account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage.
* General-purpose v1 accounts: Legacy account type for blobs, files, queues, and tables. Use general-purpose v2 accounts instead when possible.
* BlockBlobStorage accounts: Blob-only storage accounts with premium performance characteristics. Recommended for scenarios with high transactions rates, using smaller objects, or requiring consistently low storage latency.
* FileStorage accounts: Files-only storage accounts with premium performance characteristics. Recommended for enterprise or high performance-scale applications.
* BlobStorage accounts: Legacy Blob-only storage accounts. Use general-purpose v2 accounts instead when possible.

## Securing access to storage accounts

Every request to Azure Storage must be authorized. Azure Storage supports the following authorization methods:

* Microsoft Entra integration for blob and queue data. Azure Storage supports authentication and authorization with Microsoft Entra ID for the Blob and Queue services via role-based access control (RBAC). Authorizing requests with Microsoft Entra ID is recommended for superior security and ease of use. For more information, see Authorize access to Azure blobs and queues using Microsoft Entra ID.
* Microsoft Entra authorization over SMB for Azure Files (preview). Azure Files supports identity-based authorization over SMB (Server Message Block) through Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Your domain-joined Windows virtual machines (VMs) can access Azure file shares using Microsoft Entra credentials. For more information, see Overview of Microsoft Entra authorization over SMB for Azure Files (preview).
* Authorization with Shared Key. The Azure Storage Blob, Queue, and Table services and Azure Files support authorization with Shared Key.A client using Shared Key authorization passes a header with every request that is signed using the storage account access key. For more information, see Authorize with Shared Key.
* Authorization using shared access signatures (SAS). A shared access signature (SAS) is a string containing a security token that can be appended to the URI for a storage resource. The security token encapsulates constraints such as permissions and the interval of access.
* Anonymous access to containers and blobs. A container and its blobs may be publicly available. When you specify that a container or blob is public, anyone can read it anonymously; no authentication is required.

## More Azure Storage options

There are several additional types of Azure storage available.

### Azure Files

Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares that can be accessed by using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. That means that multiple VMs can share the same files with both read and write access. You can also read the files using the REST interface or the storage client libraries.

One thing that distinguishes Azure Files from files on a corporate file share is that you can access the files from anywhere in the world using a URL that points to the file and includes a shared access signature (SAS) token. You can generate SAS tokens; they allow specific access to a private asset for a specific amount of time.

File shares can be used for many common scenarios:

* Many on-premises applications use file shares. This feature makes it easier to migrate those applications that share data to Azure. If you mount the file share to the same drive letter that the on-premises application uses, the part of your application that accesses the file share should work with minimal, if any, changes.
* Configuration files can be stored on a file share and accessed from multiple VMs. Tools and utilities used by multiple developers in a group can be stored on a file share, ensuring that everybody can find them, and that they use the same version.
* Diagnostic logs, metrics, and crash dumps are just three examples of data that can be written to a file share and processed or analyzed later.

At this time, Active Directory-based authentication and access control lists (ACLs) are not supported, but they will be at some time in the future. The storage account credentials are used to provide authentication for access to the file share. This means anybody with the share mounted will have full read/write access to the share.

### Azure Queue storage

The Azure Queue service is used to store and retrieve messages. Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages. Queues are generally used to store lists of messages to be processed asynchronously.

For example, say you want your customers to be able to upload pictures, and you want to create thumbnails for each picture. You could have your customer wait for you to create the thumbnails while uploading the pictures. An alternative would be to use a queue. When the customer finishes their upload, write a message to the queue. Then have an Azure Function retrieve the message from the queue and create the thumbnails. Each of the parts of this processing can be scaled separately, giving you more control when tuning it for your usage.

### Azure Table storage

Azure Table storage is now part of Azure Cosmos DB. To see Azure Table storage documentation, see the Azure Table Storage Overview. In addition to the existing Azure Table storage service, there is a new Azure Cosmos DB Table API offering that provides throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. To learn more and try out the new premium experience, please check out Azure Cosmos DB Table API.
