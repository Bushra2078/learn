## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You work at an athletic shoe company that is launching a new product. You sell shoes on your website, manage your cloud-hosted advertising videos, and monitor social media to see how the community is responding to the launch. This one product launch generates several tasks that are both customer-facing processes like direct sales and administrative processes like auto-archiving old videos. You need to be able to support all of these processes at scale but donâ€™t have the physical resources to do it manually. You want to investigate if Azure Logic Apps can automate these processes at scale in the cloud.
