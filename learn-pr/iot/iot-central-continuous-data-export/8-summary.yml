  questions:

  - content: 'Why do we need an Azure Maps account for this module?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'To enter the location of the truck on a map.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The location of the truck is handled by the IoT Central dashboard.
    - content: 'To calculate the best route from one location to another'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure Maps enables many route finding options.
    - content: 'To display a map background'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: We don't render any particular background in this module.

  - content: 'What three Azure resources can continuous data be exported to?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Blob storage, IoT Hub, and Service Queue'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Only one of these three is correct.
    - content: 'Blob storage, Service Bus, and Iot Hub'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Two of these are correct.
    - content: 'Cosmos DB storage, Service Queue, and Iot Hub'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: None of these are correct.
    - content: 'Blob storage, Service Bus, and Event Hubs'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Blob storage for a cold path, Service Bus or Event Hubs for a warm path.
      
  - content: 'What is one of tne of the key differences between sending data to Blob storage, and sending it to either Service Bus or Event Hubs?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'When it comes to sending data, there is no real difference.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There is a difference, blob storage does not make the best warm path.
    - content: 'When sending to Blob storage all changes are submitted once per minute. Service Bus, and Event Hubs, receive data in near real-time.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Blob storage for a cold path, Service Bus or Event Hubs for a warm path.
    - content: 'For Blob storage, all the telemetry and device data is sent. For the other two services, only a subset of telemetry data is sent.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All three services receive comprehensive and complete data.
    - content: 'Blob storage receives data in the JSON format, the other services do not.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All of the services receive data in the JSON format.

  - content: 'Which of the following statements is false?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'You can only export data to Blob storage, Service Bus, or Event Hubs, that are in the same Azure subscription as the IoT Central app.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This statement is false, you can send data to other subscriptions, by entering a connection string.
    - content: 'For warm path analysis, data can be sent to trigger custom rules in Azure Stream Analytics, trigger custom flows in Azure Logic Apps, or pass through Azure Functions for transformation.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true, and describes good uses of the warm continuous data paths.
    - content: 'Good uses of sending data to Blob storage include cold-path analytics such as Azure Machine Learning models, long-term trend analysis in Power Bi, or just for archiving.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true, and describes good uses of the cold continuous data paths.
    - content: 'Blob storage, Service Bus, and Event Hubs, all receive data in the JSON format.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true, the JSON format is extensively used within Azure IoT.

  - content: 'Which of the following statements is false?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Data sent to Azure Blob storage can be routed to Azure Machine Learning, to train the learning models.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true.
    - content: 'Azure Service Bus is a good service for enterprise-level message routing.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true.
    - content: 'When an IoT Central data export service is created, data is automatically routed to it. '
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This is not the case, the data export has to be set running manually.
    - content: 'Event Hubs are a good gateway for an event pipeline.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true.  

  - content: 'What are the different types of Microsoft PowerApps?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Canvas apps, and Model-driven apps'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There are three types of PowerApp.
    - content: 'Canvas apps, Model-driven apps, and Mobile apps.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Mobile app is not the name of a supported type.
    - content: 'Canvas apps, Model-driven apps, and Portal apps. '
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: We started with the Model-driven app in this module.
    - content: 'Phone apps, Tablet apps, and Web portal apps.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There is a Portal app type, but not the other two.

  - content: 'Which of the following data sources can be used for a Model-driven app?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Azure Blob storage, '
      isCorrect: false
