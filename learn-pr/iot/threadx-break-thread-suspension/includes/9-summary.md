We discussed several important terms and concepts in this module, as they are related to Azure ThreadX RTOS. 

Here are brief definitions of some key points: 

- **wait abort**: ThreadX service that aborts sleep or any other object suspension of the specified thread. If the wait is aborted, a `TX_WAIT_ABORTED` value is returned.
- **rand()**: C library function that returns a pseudo-random number in the range of 0 to `RAND_MAX`.
- **sleep**: ThreadX service that causes the calling thread to suspend for a specified number of timer ticks.
- **counting semaphore**: ThreadX resource that can be used for event notification and mutual exclusion. There are two operations for counting semaphores: the get and the put, sometimes called getting an instance from a semaphore or putting an instance on the semaphore.
