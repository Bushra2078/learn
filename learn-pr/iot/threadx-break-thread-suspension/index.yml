title: Use Wait Abort to break thread suspension
summary: Learn how to use Wait Abort to break thread suspension in Azure RTOS ThreadX.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Explore the features and uses of counting semaphores and the TX_WAIT_ABORT service.
  - Understand the purpose of a monitor thread.
  - Use a monitor thread to detect excessive wait times by other threads and break the suspension of those threads.
  - Use an application timer to compute and display the total number of cycles each thread completed, the average time for each cycle, and selected values provided by the thread_performance_info_get service.
  - Design and debug the ThreadX solution using a hands-on approach with GitHub Codespace or Visual Studio.
