  questions:
    - content: 'Which of the following features would allow a counting semaphore to operate as a mutex?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Initialize the counting semaphore to zero.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. This answer would not allow the counting semaphore to operate as a mutex.'
        - content: 'Use the put semaphore service call.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. This answer would not allow the counting semaphore to operate as a mutex.'
        - content: 'Use it as a binary semaphore.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! Using a counting semaphore as a binary semaphore would allow the semaphore to operate as a mutex.'
    - content: 'Which service call would be able to retrieve the current run count of a thread?'
      choices:
        - content: 'tx_thread_info_get'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! This service call retrieves the current run count of a thread.'
        - content: 'tx_runcount_get'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. This service call would not retrieve the current run count of a thread.'
        - content: 'tx_thread_running'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. This service call would not retrieve the current run count of a thread.'
    - content: 'Which service call would be able to break the suspension of a thread?'
      choices:
        - content: 'tx_thread_stop_suspend'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. This service call would not break the suspension of a thread.'
        - content: 'tx_thread_break'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. This service call would not break the suspension of a thread.'
        - content: 'tx_thread_wait_abort'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! This service call would be able to break the suspension of a thread.'
    - content: 'Suppose we want to use a counting semaphore for five shared resources. What should the initial value of that semaphore be?'
      choices:
        - content: '5'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! The initial value of the semaphore should be 5.'
        - content: '0'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. The initial value of the semaphore should not be 0.'
        - content: '1'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. The initial value of the semaphore should not be 1.'
    - content: 'Suppose we want to use a counting semaphore as a binary semaphore. What should the initial value of the semaphore be?'
      choices:
        - content: '1'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! The initial value of the semaphore should be 1.'
        - content: '0'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. The initial value of the semaphore should not be 0.'
        - content: '2'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. The initial value of the semaphore should not be 2.'
