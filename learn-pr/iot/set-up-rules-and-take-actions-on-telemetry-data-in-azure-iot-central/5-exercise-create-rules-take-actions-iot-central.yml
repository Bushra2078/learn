  questions:

  - content: 'What ID is identical for all devices connected to one IoT Central app?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Scope ID'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The Scope ID identifies the IoT Central app.
    - content: 'Device ID'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Device ID is unique to each device.
    - content: 'Primary Key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Primary Key is unique to each device.

  - content: 'Which statement most accurately describes a Device Set?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'All devices of a Device Template, no exceptions.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There can be exceptions.
    - content: 'All devices of a Device Template, with exceptions based on device Properties.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Any number of exceptions can be created, based on device Properties.
    - content: 'All devices of a Device Template, with exceptions based on device Settings, Properties, or Measurements.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Settings and Measurements cannot be used to define Device Sets.
    - content: 'All devices that have a setting that the device belongs to a Device Set.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There is no such setting.

  - content: 'What is the process of authenticating devices to IoT Central known as?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Authenticating'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Good try, but no, there is a specific name for authenticating devices.
    - content: 'Servicing'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Servicing is a broader term than authenticating devices.
    - content: 'Provisioning'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This term is what you will see in the IoT Central portal.
      
  - content: 'If you add a map to a dashboard, device locations are added by default, what additional information can be added for each device?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'One state measurement'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: In our scenario contents state, cooling system state, or truck state, could be added to the map, in the form of a color code.
    - content: 'One telemetry measurement'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Telemetry measurements could be a bit complicated to show with just a color.
    - content: 'One event measurement'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Events are shown elsewhere.
    - content: 'Nothing'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: One additional piece of information can be added.
