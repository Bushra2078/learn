Congratulations, you have completed all the development and testing work for this module. Let's summarize what we have learned, and finish with a short knowledge check.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an Azure IoT Central custom app, using the IoT Central portal
- Import a device template for a custom device, using the IoT Central portal
- Monitor and command a simulated refrigerated truck, from an IoT Central dashboard
- Create a range of rules, with associated actions, responding to the movements and state of the refrigerated truck

## Clean up

The IoT Central app, with a Trial subscription, will be deleted automatically when the trial comes to an end.

All rules associated with device templates that are part of the Trial subscription, will also be automatically deleted.

## Next steps

Take your interest further with:

- [Azure IoT Central Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/)
- [Build workflows with the IoT Central connector in Microsoft Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/howto-add-microsoft-flow)

And look out for additional Learn modules covering IoT Central.
