  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How should you handle a potentially compromised device that's part of a group enrollment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete the group enrollment and update all of the devices with a new certificate chain of trust."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "Create an individual enrollment to disallow the potentially compromised device then delete the device from IoT hub."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ""
    - content: "Delete the CA certificate from DPS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "Delete the potentially compromised device from IoT hub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
  - content: "What certificate or certificates do you upload to DPS to enable group enrollment with X.509"
    choices:
    - content: "The bottom-level device certificates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "The highest intermediate certificate that all the devices share."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ""
    - content: "The top-level root CA certificate for your organization."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "The entire certificate chain of trust."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
  - content: "Group enrollments include the option to specify an initial configuration of a device. What mechanism is used to apply this configuration?"
    choices:
    - content: "The enrollment process instructs IoT Hub to trigger a direct method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "The enrollment process uses a security token to request device access permission and pushes the configuration to the device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "The enrollment process includes a device twin state field that contains desired properties for the device."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ""
  - content: "The Device Provisioning Service uses X.509 certificates to help ensure that device connections are secure. What type of certificate is used to verify proof of possession for the root certificate?"
    choices:
    - content: "A leaf certificate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A leaf certificate is the end-entity certificate that is used to validate a device."
    - content: "An intermediate certificate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Intermediate certificates are used to validate leaf certificates or other intermediate certificates."
    - content: "A verification certificate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A verification certificate, which is created by using the root certificate and a DPS-generated verification code, is used to establish proof of possession."
  - content: "What needs to be completed in order to deprovision a single device from a group enrollment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Disable or delete the device from the IoT hub's identity registry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action does not prevent the device from being reprovisioned as part of the group enrollment."
    - content: "Create a disabled individual enrollment for the device's leaf certificate, disable or delete the device from the IoT hub's identity registry, and then delete the disabled individual enrollment for the device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deleting the disabled enrollment for the device would allow the device to re-enroll through the enrollment group."
    - content: "Create a disabled individual enrollment for the device's leaf certificate and then disable or delete the device from the IoT hub's identity registry."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The disabled individual enrollment blocks DPS from reprovisioning the device and deleting or disabling the device from IoT Hub prevents the device from connecting to the IoT hub."
