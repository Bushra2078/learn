You have been tasked with validating your company's planned cheese shipping container monitoring and tracking system upgrade. The planned tracking device system upgrade uses Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) and X.509 certificate authentication for IoT device auto-provisioning and deprovisioning. 

You used code to test and validate that the Azure IoT Hub DPSs provisioning and deprovisioning with X.509 certificate authentication capabilities will fit your company's planned system upgrade.

If you and your company had not validated the DPS with X.509 certificate authentication provisioning and deprovisioning process, you would not know if the process would work for your planned system upgrade.

Validating the process has prepared you to provide detailed input into planning for the update to your company's cheese shipping container monitoring and tracking solution.
