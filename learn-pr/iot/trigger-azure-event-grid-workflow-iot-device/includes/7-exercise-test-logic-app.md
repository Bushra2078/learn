Test your logic app by creating a new device to trigger an event notification email.

1. From your IoT hub, select **IoT devices**.

2. Select **+ New**.

3. For **Device ID**, enter `CheeseCave1_Building1_Thermostat`.

4. Select **Save**.

   Creating this device will trigger the logic app and send and email that contains the event details. Here is how the email looks like:

    [![Email received](../media/email-received.png)](../media/email-received.png#lightbox)

5. To test the event subscription filters, you can add multiple devices with different device IDs. For example - try these examples:

   * CheeseCave1_Building1_Thermostat
   * CheeseCave1_Building1_Light
   * CheeseCave2_Building1_Thermostat
   * CheeseCave2_Building2_Light

   If you added the four examples, your list of IoT devices should look like the following image:

    [![IoT Hub device list](../media/iot-hub-device-list.png)](../media/iot-hub-device-list.png#lightbox)

6. Once you've added a few devices to your IoT hub, check your email to see which ones triggered the logic app. Did you receive the emails you expected?
