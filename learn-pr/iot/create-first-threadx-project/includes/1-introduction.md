In a previous module of this learning path you were introduced you to fundamental concepts of Azure RTOS ThreadX (ThreadX). Some of the topics were scheduling, determinism, priorities, preemption, and threads. You were also presented with an overview of ThreadX services and memory management options. You should now be ready to explore additional ThreadX services and apply them in a project.

The purpose of this Hello World project is to provide a practical introduction to ThreadX and demonstrate how it can be used. We'll investigate a small problem and develop a solution for it. You'll gain a better understanding of ThreadX, and discover why it's one of the most widely deployed RTOSes in the world.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:
   - Be introduced to the basics of ThreadX system development.
   - Walk through a simple illustrative example of a ThreadX project.
   - Be given a simple but realistic scenario and identify the essential ThreadX components needed to implement that system.
   - Understand the fundamentals required for an Azure RTOS ThreadX real-time solution.
   - Design and debug the ThreadX solution using a hands-on approach with GitHub Codespace or Visual Studio.
