In this exercise, you run the Azure Digital Twins Explorer from your Azure Digital Twins instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and set up your chocolate factory digital twin.

Navigate to your Azure Digital Twins instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Next, select the **Open Azure Digital Twins Explorer (preview)** button to open an Azure Digital Twins Explorer window connected to the instance.

## Switch contexts

1. Once you're in the Azure Digital Twins Explorer, you can change the context of which Azure Digital Twins instance is currently connected. Select the instance name from the top toolbar:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/azure-digital-twins-explorer-instance-url-1.png" alt-text="Terminal help output when running npm install." lightbox="../media/azure-digital-twins-explorer-instance-url-1.png":::

1. This will bring up the **Azure Digital Twins URL modal**, where you can enter the host name of another Azure Digital Twins instance after the *https://* to connect to that instance:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/azure-digital-twins-explorer-instance-url-2.png" alt-text="Terminal help output when running npm install." lightbox="../media/azure-digital-twins-explorer-instance-url-2.png":::

## Upload the chocolate factory production line models

1. Locate the icon that uploads models.

1. Go to your folder that contains all your chocolate factory production line models. Select all of them, and upload them to the Azure Digital Twins explorer sample.

1. If you get any errors, you'll need to go back to [unit 4](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/develop-with-azure-digital-twins/build-azure-digital-twins-graph-for-chocolate-factory/4-exercise-create-digital-twin-definition-language-models) and check your work for the model that has the error.

If there aren't any errors, you'll see a list of models in the left of your explorer sample window:

## Create digital twins

1. Select the icon (shown in the following image) to create a twin for the factory model. Name the twin *factory*, and create it.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/create-twin.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the icon for creating a model twin in the explorer sample." lightbox="../media/create-twin.png":::

1. Create digital twins for the following models, giving the models the suggested names, or using your own names:
    - Factory floor: "floor"
    - Production line: "production_line"
    - Roasting step: "roasting"
    - Grinding step: "grinding"
    - Molding step: "molding"

1. There's no need to create a twin for the **Factory Production Steps** model. It's a base model, and its values are inherited by the three production steps.

You should now see all the created digital twins in the graph view. Also note that the properties for a selected digital twin appear in the right-hand pane of the explorer sample:

## Create relationships

To create a relationship, hold down the Ctrl key, select the *source* twin, and then select the *target* twin. Next, select the **Add relationship** icon, and select a relationship from the range you're offered. If you aren't offered any options, then no relationship can be created.

1. Locate the **Add Relationship** icon along the range of icons for the graph view. Don't select it yet.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/explorer-add-relationship-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Add Relationship icon of the explorer sample." lightbox="../media/explorer-add-relationship-icon.png":::

1. Hold down the Ctrl key and select your **factory** twin circle. Then, select the **floor** twin. From the list of relationships, select **rel_has_floors**.

1. Hold down the Ctrl key and select your **floor** twin. Then, select the **production line** twin. From the list of relationships, select **rel_runs_lines**.

1. Hold down the Ctrl key and select your **roasting** twin. Then, select the **production line** twin. From the list of relationships, select **rel_step_link**.

1. Repeat the previous step for the **grinding** twin, and do this again for the **molding** twin.

You should now see all the relationships between the digital twins in the graph view:

## Explore the graph layout options

1. The button to switch graph layouts is grayed out until a query is run. To enable it, run the default query `select * FROM digitaltwins`:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/explorer-run-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the layout of the ADT Explorer sample" lightbox="../media/explorer-run-query.png":::

1. Locate the icon in the graph view that gives a range of layout options, with names such as "Cola" and "Klay":

    :::image type="content" source="../media/explorer-graph-layout.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the graph icon for changing layout options in the explorer sample." lightbox="../media/explorer-graph-layout.png":::

1. Try each of the layout options in turn.

1. Notice that you can zoom in and out, and that there are some other helpful icons to fit your graph to your screen.

Feel free to explore the graph view. However, you've completed all the steps for this unit. In the next unit, you'll go into the digital twin query language.
