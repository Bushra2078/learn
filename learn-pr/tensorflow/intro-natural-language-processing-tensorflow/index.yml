  title: Introduction to natural language processing with TensorFlow
  description: In this module, we will explore different neural network architectures for dealing with natural language texts. In recent years, **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) has experienced fast growth and advancement. This is primarily because the performance of the language models depends on their overall ability to "understand" text and can be trained using an unsupervised technique on large text corpora. Additionally, pre-trained text models such as BERT simplified many NLP tasks and has dramatically improved the performance. We will learn more about these techniques as well as the basics of NLP in this learning module.
