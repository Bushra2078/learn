  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "An expert suggests using a pool of training data that has been gathered from observations of human workers performing tasks and making decisions. What is an unintended consequence that must be anticipated?"
    choices:
    - content: "AI will replicate human biases and prejudices that result in the unfair treatment of people of a particular race or gender."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This is a definite concern as this problem has already been encountered with AI simply replicating the biases exemplified by the human workers it was modeled to learn from."
    - content: "AI cannot learn the subtleties of human opinion; therefore, AI will make decisions purely based on data criteria."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While the intended goal of AI is to make data driven decisions, it has been proven that AI can replicate human traits such as favoritism."
    - content: "The transparent nature of AI will result in decreased intelligibility concerning performance-based decision making."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One of the established guiding principles for AI is a commitment to transparency, which increases the intelligibility for stakeholders."
    - content: "AI has no level of accountability; thus, poor qualitative decisions can occur without any sense of recourse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Accountability is one of the six guiding principles set forth by Microsoft to guide AI deployment and use."
  - content: "Why is explainability such an important aspect of responsible AI in the financial services industry?"
    choices:
    - content: "Many customers are curious about the ways in which AI can enrich their lives."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Explainability refers to customers understanding how AI operates, not necessarily the benefits it can unlock for them."
    - content: "Many customers are concerned with the risks of AI or feel that it’s advancing too quickly, and they don’t understand the potential risks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Being able to explain how AI systems function can mitigate customer uncertainty and build trust."
    - content: "Customers will engage with AI-based services more regularly if they understand how those services operate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this is true, the goal of explainable AI solutions is to mitigate customer uncertainty, not simply increase engagement with AI systems."
    - content: "Financial service institutions are more likely to identify mistakes made by AI if they can articulate how it is operating."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this is true, the goal of explainable AI solutions is to mitigate customer uncertainty, not simply identify mistakes."
  - content: "Which two Microsoft guiding principles underpin the other four?"
    choices:
    - content: "Privacy and security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While these guiding principles are very important, they are not essential for ensuring the effectiveness of the rest."
    - content: "Reliability and safety"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While these guiding principles are very important, they are not essential for ensuring the effectiveness of the rest."
    - content: "Fairness and inclusivity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While these guiding principles are very important, they are not essential for ensuring the effectiveness of the rest."
    - content: "Transparency and accountability."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These guiding principles are foundational and are essential for ensuring the effectiveness of the rest."
  - content: "An engineering team wants to develop a new tool that lets users convert their facial expressions into an animated creature. Before launching their tool, they plan on testing it extensively with users from around the world. Which guiding principle(s) is/are most relevant?"
    choices:
    - content: "Fairness and inclusivity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The guiding principle of fairness dictates that AI systems behave the same way for everyone, and the guiding principle of inclusivity dictates that AI tools do not exclude people."
    - content: "Reliability and safety."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The guiding principles of reliability and safety are more relevant in scenarios where AI systems could cause harm."
    - content: "Transparency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The guiding principle of transparency is essential, but not the most relevant here."
    - content: "Privacy and security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The guiding principles of privacy and security should definitely be considerations in this scenario, but testing the tool on a diverse group of users does not address privacy and security concerns."
  - content: "Which answer best describes why State Farm believes successful AI requires interdisciplinary collaboration?"
    choices:
    - content: "State Farm found that AI initiatives are more likely to be successful and achieve organizational objectives when business decision-makers work alongside developers and technical experts."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. State Farm encourages partnerships between different groups throughout the organization with diverse skills and perspectives.  IT teams working in isolation might create models that aren’t ideally suited to business goals and processes."
    - content: "State Farm found that interdisciplinary collaboration reduces costs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While cross-team collaboration on an AI solution may increase ROI in the long-run, saving money is not the primary goal."
    - content: "State Farm does not believe that successful AI requires interdisciplinary collaboration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. State Farm found that AI initiatives are more likely to be successful when business decision-makers work alongside developers and technical experts."
    - content: "State Farm believes that interdisciplinary collaboration will accelerate the speed at which AI solutions are developed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While cross-team collaboration may accelerate solution development, speed is not the primary goal."
