Enacting change in an organization to innovate and adapt requires a company culture empowered to do so. Your organization’s culture should be one that approaches innovation as a platform, meaning the organization provides access to the resources, data, and technologies needed for cross-domain collaboration while also structuring, investing in, and encouraging a culture capable of innovating. The five attributes listed below outline key ideas to consider when establishing a collaborative work environment for your people:

1. **Internal alignment:** Being in alignment within an organization is extremely important.  Teams across different departments should work together to achieve common goals. In fact, 83 percent of digitally mature organizations depend on cross-functional teams to advance their innovation efforts<sup>2</sup>.
1. **Mindset:** Organizations thrive when they embrace a growth mindset: a willingness to fail and learn from the experience. Embracing and living this mindset means people will be more comfortable with collaborating and combining different ideas to challenge the status quo and take risk.
1. **Skilling:** No matter what level of technology is involved; organizations are always run by people. That’s why it’s necessary to take the time to understand, access, and change the skill set of an employee, when needed.
1. **Budget:** You might be thinking to yourself, “how does budget fit into the five essential attributes?” Being intentional about budget allocation sets up long-term success. Focus on finding the right balance between funding existing revenue streams and incubation opportunities.
1. **Vision:** It’s essential for innovation to align with growth strategy and ethical principles. Organizations should determine intended direction and understand what’s needed to get there—then innovate in ways that support the path.

These are all things to consider when striving for long-term innovation, but the reality is that most innovative companies today are innovating within silos, also known as siloed innovation. Imagine an organization with five locations in various cities. The Seattle team might come up with an innovative idea to help increase engagement with their marketing campaigns. How does this solution get shared to other teams? Do other teams get to weigh in on the effectiveness of the idea? Has this idea already been pitched by another team before? Siloed innovation may be accidental or intentional, but you see why cross-organizational collaboration and knowledge-sharing could magnify the impact of the innovation and create more long-last change for the organization at large.  

Organizations with an intentional, collaborative culture drive an innovative mindset and tend to be the ones capturing more revenue, more customers, and more success long term. In their research for Harvard Business Review, Heidi Gardner found “that firms with more cross-boundary collaboration achieve greater customer loyalty and higher margins.” <sup>3</sup>

But there are challenges that stand in the way:

* Complexity of creating an intentional approach and organizational competence to develop innovations across different lines of business internally and externally.
* Lack of time for people to innovate. If employees spend their full focus and workday solely on the services and products they support, this limits opportunities for creative exploration and experimentation.
* Lack of tools or resources to facilitate operational challenges.
* Lack of commitment or participation from internal teams.

Next, let’s see how one of the world’s largest communications companies focused on tackling these challenges to unlock the benefits of collaboration across their business to remain competitive in the market.
