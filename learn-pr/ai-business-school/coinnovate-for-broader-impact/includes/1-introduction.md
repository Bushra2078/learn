For businesses, innovation helps increase the bottom line, produce better products, and enhance and accelerate processes. But innovation doesn’t exist in a vacuum, especially when it involves technology. Innovation almost always has implications that extend beyond our own walls and, intended or not, new technologies, like AI, bring with them new challenges that have very real impacts on communities—so it’s essential to ensure you’re innovating with collective purpose and in a responsible way. Check out our Responsible AI for Business learning path to learn more about the six principles to consider for responsible AI.

Organizations should lead their innovation efforts to ultimately help their people, their customers, and their communities, which will ultimately make or keep them competitive. Coinnovation requires input from diverse perspectives found outside your organization. Sourcing and validating ideas from relevant external audiences and customers helps develop a fuller picture of the root challenges businesses are trying to solve. Engaging with external partners not only leads to better ideas, but also shows appreciation and builds public trust in your organization. After all, people are more inclined to support businesses that serve a genuine and meaningful purpose that resonates with their own community.
