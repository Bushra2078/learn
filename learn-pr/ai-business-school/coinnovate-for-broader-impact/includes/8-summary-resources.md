Throughout this module, we’ve discussed how important it’s to coinnovate beyond your organization to accelerate solutions and remain competitive long term. We’ve also uncovered that innovation doesn’t exist in a vacuum—especially with technology companies. New technologies bring new challenges for organizations of all sizes. These challenges have a huge impact on communities and when specific issues arise, specialized partnerships are necessary. That’s why external partnerships and collaboration play a key role in understanding how innovation efforts impact people and the community beyond your organization—especially with groups who have more knowledge of the issue at hand. By creating this culture and understanding the different relationships, your organization will thrive despite disruptions—making you more resilient.

* Describe the benefits of collaborating with external partners.
