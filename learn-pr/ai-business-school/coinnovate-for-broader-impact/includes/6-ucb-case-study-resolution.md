## Approach 

Many areas of drug discovery require UCB to analyze high-dimensional datasets. Generating initial computational drug designs using UCB propriety technology requires a massive amount of compute power and a lot of data processing. To enhance their speed to discovery in light of COVID-19, UCB partnered with Microsoft and earned their AI for Health grant, enabling UCB to use the computing power of Azure to process rapidly their molecule designs and tests. UCB believed partnerships could help scale greater impact to collaborate with an open approach towards innovation.<sup>7</sup> “Innovation occurs at the interfaces of disciplines,” says Dr. Dhaval Patel, Chief Scientific Officer at UCB. “And the discipline that Microsoft has and the discipline that UCB has—that interface is ripe for innovation today.”

With their new partnership and AI technology, a significant portion of UCB’s employees were equipped to hit the ground running by volunteering their time to contribute their molecular designs. UCB was the first pharmaceutical company to join the COVID Moonshot—an open-science consortium hosted on PostEra in pursuit of a globally accessible antiviral pill to cure COVID. This crowdsourced initiative brings together biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, technology partners, and the public to help identify lead molecules and collaborate with scientists on the forum.

Beyond COVID Moonshot, UCB has continued to coinnovate with other organizations to further research and development as COVID-19 continuously evolves. For example, they’ve partnered with Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease to identify crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. They’ve also become a member of the COVID Research and Development Alliance with other pharmaceutical companies and academics in therapeutic drug research and development—working towards identifying and accelerating the most promising candidates across a broad spectrum of therapies and vaccines.<sup>8</sup>

## Results

The result of UCB’s challenge to accelerate drug design and development was significant. By collaborating with Microsoft and integrating Azure, UCB completed six months’ work of computational screening and compound design in just three days across data centers in the US and Europe. This not only saved time for researchers and scientists during their research and clinical trials, but it allowed them to quickly contribute their findings in the fight against COVID-19.

UCB demonstrated the power of technology and human collaboration as critical components in contributing to the COVID-19 response. As a result of UCB’s coinnovation efforts, so far more than 5,000 molecular designs have been crowdsourced on COVID Moonshot, out of which more than 400 compounds have been synthesized.<sup>9</sup> With the project’s worldwide, open-science format, there’s a clear opportunity to empower other research organizations to build on current progress. It’s these types of dedicated partnerships and collective goal-setting that UCB believes can make the greatest impact.

“This is a great example of how AI has been used, not only by UCB, but by the community in general, to make an impact on patients’ lives,” says Dr. Patel. “And it's a success story so far.”

By applying new digital tools to the entirety of their work and supporting the COVID Moonshot project, UCB is strengthening business resiliency as well as the resiliency of the patients they serve. By bringing communities together and leveraging the right technology, resilience is more than just attainable—it’s inherent in the outcome of collaboration, adaptability, and empowerment.

## Key takeaways

### The power of coinnovation during a crisis  

To be an innovative organization, business leaders need to rely on external collaboration to connect groups with specific knowledge of an issue at hand—not just their internal processes. Innovation has always been part of UCB’s mission to transform lives, but it was their sense of urgency to coinnovate with Microsoft. This partnership ultimately led to their success in expediting drug discovery during the pandemic.

### Technology as a catalyst for adapting

By combining supercomputing powers and AI with UCB’s pharmaceutical expertise, UCB was able to adapt and transform the way they work. Their approach to innovation and technology has positioned them well to respond to COVID-19 in a collaborative way.

Now let’s review some takeaway learnings from this module.
