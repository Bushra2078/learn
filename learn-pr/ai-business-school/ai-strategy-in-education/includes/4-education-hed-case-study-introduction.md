## Abstract

To meet rising student expectations and handle growing class sizes, the University of New South Wales Sydney (UNSW) is leveraging technology to reimagine the classroom experience. As part of its broader AI strategy, UNSW has been deploying pilot programs to assess the potential impact of AI on student outcomes. One of the most promising pilot programs has been led by senior lecturer Dr. David Kellermann, who implemented Microsoft Teams in one of his classes, generating a 900% increase in student engagement. To better handle his high enrollment and student participation, Kellermann developed an AI-powered chatbot that can answer students’ questions and trained an AI model to prepare personalized study guides for every student. This resulted in better outcomes for Kellermann’s students and serves as a testament to the transformative power of AI for the educational sector.

## Industry Context

College is a significant investment—with students investing a large amount of their time and money into their education, it’s unsurprising that they’re expecting to see more return on investment (ROI) from their universities. In addition, today’s digitally-native students have grown up with the internet and chatbots, so they’ve come to expect instant answers to their questions and the option to engage in their education on their own terms, 24/7.

UNSW in Sydney is leveraging technology in new ways to meet these heightened expectations. They are already one of the top 50 universities in the world, but are striving to become Australia’s leading global university by 2025.<sup>1</sup> To achieve this ambitious goal, UNSW has developed an AI strategy featuring a number of pilot programs designed to reimagine the classroom experience for its 65,000 students.

One of UNSW’s most exciting AI programs is led by Dr. David Kellermann, senior lecturer and researcher in UNSW’s engineering school.

## Challenge

Kellermann has classes of over 600 students, including remote students who watch his lectures online. He started using the collaboration platform Teams to better reach and connect in-class and remote students, but this created a new challenge. Students began using the chat function to ask the teaching staff questions, and their engagement on the platform increased 900% over the course of the term.

How could the teaching staff respond to so many questions from hundreds of students without overlooking any inquiries? To find solutions, they turned to the wealth of data within Teams, which collected and stored data from chat and discussion forums, video lecture recordings and transcripts, live-synchronized lecture notes, study guides, assignments, and more.

## Strategy questions

The following are questions you can use to start thinking about how to implement AI in your own educational organization. Think critically about these questions before watching the executive Q&A video and continuing on to the case study resolution.

1. How could the teaching staff handle a 900% increase in engagement without missing student questions?
2. How could this increase in engagement lead to a personalized experience for each student?
3. How could this new repository of data improve the learning experience for students?
4. How could this new repository of data empower the teaching staff?
5. What kind of predictions could be made from these engagement data?

Now that you’ve gained context on the challenges UNSW faced and considered critical questions to answer before implementing AI, let’s listen to Dr. Kellermann explain how UNSW transformed the classroom experience with AI.
