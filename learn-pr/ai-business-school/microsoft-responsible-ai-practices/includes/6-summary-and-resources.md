As AI becomes more prevalent, it’s imperative that organizations have processes in place to ensure that it’s used responsibly. At Microsoft, we’ve been working on AI for over a decade, and while that we recognize that we don’t have all of the answers, we hope that our experience and perspective will prove valuable to others as they embark on their own AI journey.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Establish responsible design principles within your own AI engineering teams.
* Utilize valuable tools to help your teams work with AI responsibly.  
* Engage with external parties and use AI for good.

### Skill up resources

* [2018 WEF Future of Jobs Report](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf) states many companies have been focusing their upskilling and retraining efforts on those people who already have higher skills and value to the company.
* The [Microsoft Professional Program](https://academy.microsoft.com/professional-program/tracks/artificial-intelligence/) now has an AI track bringing together expert instructors, provide hands-on labs, offer AI-specific online courses and instructional videos.
* The [Skillful Initiative](https://www.markle.org/rework-america/skillful), a partnership with the Markle Foundation in the US, helps match people with employers and fill high-demand jobs.

### Microsoft Programs

AI for Good includes three programs: [AI for Accessibility](https://www.microsoft.com/ai-for-accessibility), [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/ai-for-earth/), and [AI for Humanitarian Action](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/ai-for-humanitarian-action), which are already supporting nearly 250 projects across the globe. Learn more about how to protect against new AI-specific security threats by reading our paper, [Securing the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57597) and follow along with the news. For example, last year we publicly [called for regulation](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/07/13/facial-recognition-technology-the-need-for-public-regulation-and-corporate-responsibility/) of facial recognition technology and outlined our recommendations for the public and private sector alike.
