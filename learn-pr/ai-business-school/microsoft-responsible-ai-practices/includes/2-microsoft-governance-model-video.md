Developing responsible AI governance is a crucial process, but it’s not an easy one. To help spark ideas, we’d like to share executive insight about our experience with two important pieces of our responsible AI governance: the AI, Ethics, and Effects in Engineering and Research Committee (Aether) and the Office of Responsible AI.

Watch this video from Eric Horvitz, Technical Fellow and Director at Microsoft Research, as he explains how Microsoft is using its mission to empower people and organizations to guide its approach to responsible AI.

Eric Horvitz explained the driving forces behind Aether, how the committee is structured to align with AI principles at Microsoft, and the way it has pulled together experts from across the company to help think through some of the organization’s most challenging issues. Eric Horvitz also described how Aether collaborates with other internal entities like the Office of Responsible AI and its engagements that extend beyond Microsoft, into the outside world.

However, the work is not done. Microsoft will continue to iterate its processes and evolve its structures with the ultimate goal of delivering value to customers through the development of responsible technology.
