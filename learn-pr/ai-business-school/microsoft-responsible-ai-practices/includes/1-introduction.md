At Microsoft, we have established our own governing practices for responsible AI. This includes forming governing bodies, developing AI policies, and providing engineering teams with actionable guidance and tools. Finally, we aim to empower people and organizations to use AI to improve lives around the world. While every organization will have its own approach and we don’t have all the answers, we’d like to share what we’ve learned so far.

**In this module, you will learn to:**

* Explain how Microsoft provides accountability for responsible AI through a governance structure.
* Describe how Microsoft risk management processes are used to identify, assess, and mitigate risks.
* Establish responsible design principles within your own organization.

Let’s explore Microsoft’s practices for responsible AI.
