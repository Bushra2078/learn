  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which technology trend is generating large volumes of raw, unstructured information from our homes and businesses?"
    choices:
    - content: "Massive computing power"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The computing power available in cloud or on-premises processes the large volumes of information. It does not generate it."
    - content: "Powerful algorithms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deep learning and reinforcement algorithms powered by massive computing power and applied against Big Data enable AI. But the algorithms don’t generate the Big Data."
    - content: "Big data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Big data is a concept related to the massive volume of unstructured data generated by our use of internal or cloud computing services such as Twitter, Netflix, GPS smartphones, and local store purchases."
    - content: "Speech recognition"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Speech recognition is one of the products and capabilities of AI: cognition, learning, and perception."

      What method of AI needs to give a machine a lot of data with price, year, make, model, mileage, and other features of a car before it can find patterns and be able to predict car prices?
    choices:
    - content: "Machine Memorizing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine Learning trains a machine to learn differentiating features about data and find patterns. Not to memorize data"
    - content: "Machine Learning"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.  Machine Learning trains a machine to learn differentiating features about data and find patterns to make predictions."      
    - content: "Deep Learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deep Learning automatically finds differentiating features from data on its own."

      A company that provides continuing professional education for nurses is attempting to integrate AI into their existing products to ensure that the education is tailored for the learners’ needs. They have invested millions of dollars into the online software that delivers these training modules.   
      They do not want to throw it all away and start from scratch to include AI technology.  
      Which Microsoft product would allow them to incorporate pre-built AI capabilities into their products?
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Cognitive Services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These are the pre-built AI services that can be purchased as a product from Azure."
    - content: "Conversational AI platforms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conversational AI platforms and their conversational agents are used when building a new application that are designed around AI."
    - content: "Speech to text"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Speech to text is an example of a conversational agent that might be a part of the AI used in the training software. It is not a Microsoft product that, by itself, provides AI capabilities to an existing system."
    - content: "Machine learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A machine learning is only a small part of an AI solution."

      A local weather station wants to use machine learning to accurately predict rainfall.  They have daily historical data with the following numeric data: time of the year, temperature, humidity, wind speed and rain days.  What type of machine learning algorithm should they use for this problem?
    choices:
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This problem is not trying to find the distinction between classes or categories."
    - content: "Cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This problem is not trying to find groups that the data belongs in."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This problem is using a continuous numeric data that you can find patterns over time."
