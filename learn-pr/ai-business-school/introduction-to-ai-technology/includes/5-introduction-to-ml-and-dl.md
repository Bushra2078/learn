Not every business problem can be solved by prebuilt AI services. Machine learning can be implemented to help solve problems based on unique data and business needs. We're seeing many ways to optimize business efficiency using machine learning by training a model for predictive analytics for use cases such as fraud detection, customer churn, or predictive maintenance on machinery. In this unit, we're going to dive into the basics of machine learning and deep learning. We will do this by discussing how these methods can be used across industries.

**Machine learning**

To learn what machine learning is, first you must understand what a model is.  Often, you'll hear references to a model and people talking about tuning, training, tweaking, and deploying models. So, what is a model?  A model is just a function, just like any other function. The difference is a machine learning model is the output function or file that is produced after it has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns in data. You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data. Typically, data scientists use a programming language like Python or R, along with machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn, tensorflow, or pytorch to train and build the model. Once you have trained the model, you can use it to reason over data that it hasn't seen before and make predictions about those data.

What algorithms are used to train these models? To use machine learning, a data scientist will need to know what type of algorithm to use depending on the business problem. Common algorithms fall in three categories: classification, regression, or clustering. Classification problems are used in cases where you need a prediction between discrete classes or categories. For example, predicting a dog versus cat. Next, regression problems are used in cases where you need a prediction from a continuous numeric value. Finally, clustering problems are used in cases where you need to group data that have similar characteristics. The diagram below shows examples of the types of problems each algorithm solves.

The next piece of machine learning is data. Data plays a major part in building models and machine learning. There's no machine learning without data. A huge part of machine learning’s problem is finding the right data, cleaning it, and preparing it for training. For machine learning models to have a higher accuracy a large amount of data is needed.  After a model is trained and built, that’s when businesses can deploy it out to a machine in their factory to shut it down in case it starts to exhibit anomalous behavior. Another example is that business can deploy the model into a web application to surface recommendations or detect a fraudulent transaction.

As you can see, there are three stages of machine learning, which are: identifying and prepping the data; building and training the model; then deploying the model. Once a business deploys the model, the process is often not done because they need to observe how that model works with real-life data. For instance, does the model improve their customer's experience? Do they surface better recommendations? As data or customer behavior changes over time, the model’s accuracy may start to degrade, and the model will need to be updated. Hence the lifecycle of the machine learning continues.

The last thing to touch on is, what is deep learning? Deep learning refers to ways to build a model that uses something call neural networks.  And one of the interesting properties of neural networks is you can learn complex functions as you create deep networks, which are lots of layers. The neural networks perform incredibly well when operating on unstructured data, like images, or text, or sounds. Now, the way deep learning is often implemented uses frameworks like Tensorflow, PyTorch, or Chainer. And one of the interesting things is that all the logic that's behind deep learning can be accelerated on specialized hardware, like GPUs and FPGAs. And what these allow you to do is deploy models that are more complex and accurate into lots of different places. In addition, it lets us train on even more data, which, again, helps us create a more accurate model.

These examples showcase the different approaches used to solve business problems with machine learning and deep learning. Organizations can use huge datasets to make predictions to create better business results.

Now that you’ve learned the techniques involved in building machine learning models on a solid data foundation to create value for your business, let’s wrap up everything you’ve learned about AI technology with a knowledge check.
