**What is AI?**

The term AI tends to be thrown around a lot. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning or Deep Learning are common terms that confuse a lot of people.  So, what are they anyway?  In this section, we will clarify these methods so you can understand how it applies to your business problem.

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a ability of computer program or machine exhibited or mimic human-like behavior (e.g. visual senses, speech recognition, decision-making, natural language understanding etc).

* Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI. Machine learning is a technique where a machine sifts through a lot of data to find patterns over time.  Machine learning uses algorithms that train a machine how to learn patterns based on differentiating features about the data.  The more the training data, the more accurate the machine learns. Here are some examples:
  * Email spam detection. Machine Learning could look at patterns where email has words like "free" or "guarantee"; email address domain on a blocklist; or a link displayed in text do not match URL behind it.
  * Credit Card fraud detection.  Machine Learning could look at patterns like spending in a zip code a person does not usually visit; buying a big-ticket item; or sudden shopping spree
* Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning.  Deep Learning is imitates how a human brain processes information known as a connected artifical neural network. Instead of the linear traditional algorithms used in ML, deep learning relies on a more hierarchical layers algorithms that pass learnings from one layer to another to find patterns in a non-linear approach. In addition, deep learn does not need features about the data defined.  Give the data, deep learning have the ability to discover complex patterns and differentiating features about the data itself.  It normally works with unstructured data like images, text and audio. Thats why the requires enormous amounts of the data for better analysis and massive computing power for speed. Here are an example:  
  * Detecting cancerous cells in medical images. Deep learning scans every pixel in image as input to the neural nodes.  The nodes analyze each pixel to filter out features that look cancerous.  Each layer of nodes pushes its findings of potential cancerous cells to the next layer of node to repeat the process and eventually aggregate all its finding to classify what the image is. Eg. a healthy image vs an image with cancerous features found.

Expanding on the primary concepts of AI, where machines show capabilities that are usually associated with human capabilities, you can see how learning over time, interpreting data, and reasoning with data works. In order to achieve this, we need to feed the machine a lot of data before it can learn.  Additionally, machine learning creates algorithms varying from simple linear functions to extremely complex ones, like an artificial neural network.

Next, letâ€™s explore how to use Pre-built AI technologies that make learning, perception, and cognition easier.
