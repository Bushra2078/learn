When thinking of adopting AI into your business, you should consider prebuilt AI services first. Azure Cognitive Services is a Microsoft prebuilt AI product. These are pre-trained models that have been developed by Microsoft global researchers and data scientists to solve common problems.  To avoid reinventing the wheel, businesses can leverage prebuilt services to achieve quality and accelerate delivery of technology solutions. It's better to use the Azure Cognitive Services that offer prebuilt AI services in vision, speech, language, search, or decision-making to solve common problems. This brings AI within reach of every developer and organization without requiring machine learning expertise. As a result, it enables developers of all skill levels to easily add intelligence to new or existing business applications.

**Azure Cognitive Service real world examples**

Infusing cognitive services into existing and new business applications makes them smarter, intuitive, and customized to provide better user experience. Here are some business scenarios:

* Facial recognition
> Ride-sharing companies can use the Face service to enhance the security of riders with selfies. They can periodically prompt drivers to take a selfie before they accept ride requests. This helps ensure in real-time that the person behind the wheel matches the same person the company screened and approved in their profile account.

* Recommendation
> E-commerce or entertainment industries can improve user engagements by using the Personalizer service to understand their customers' preferences and making better recommendations to them. For gaming apps, the possible user options might be: "play a game," "watch a movie," or "join a clan." Based on that user's history and other contextual information (such as user location, time of day, device type, or day of
the week) the Personalizer service helps business suggest the best option to promote or recommend to the user.

* Conversational language
> Finally, businesses can use the Language Understanding service to create conversational bots or digital agents that allow users to interact with the bot applications using natural language understanding. This custom natural language understanding service helps streamline work processes and integrate with existing data to provide better customer service at scale to build brand loyalty and a competitive advantage for businesses.

Now that we’ve learned how prebuilt AI can help build intelligent apps by easily adding AI capabilities, let’s dive more into machine learning.
