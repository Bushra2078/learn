Innovation doesn’t exist in just one department, or rather it doesn’t have to. It comes from anywhere in an organization, but for that to happen business leaders need to lead employees to feel empowered to innovate. That means intentionally investing in the space, time, and resources to continuously encourage experimentation, trial and error, and brainstorming to improve, iterate, and adapt long term.

Companies that instill this practice will accelerate making changes to their operating environment, develop strategies in the face of sudden change, and define potential responses. Continuous innovation today requires merging the powers of human ingenuity and technology—and by doing so, business leaders are cultivating an innovative mindset across the organization.
