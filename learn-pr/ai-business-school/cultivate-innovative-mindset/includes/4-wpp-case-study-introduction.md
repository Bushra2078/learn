## Abstract

WPP is a London-based multinational communications company responsible for creating memorable campaigns, experiences, and communications for brands. They have been addressing the industry’s leading challenges with technology-driven solutions to revolutionize modern marketing. This case study describes how WPP enhances international collaboration across their organization by making powerful tools like AI accessible to everyone. By educating and empowering their employees across countries, roles, and domains to collaborate using AI, WPP is creating a foundation that will help them foster innovation to adapt quickly and retain market share in an increasingly competitive market.

## Challenge

The environment in which modern marketing operates has changed significantly over the past decade. As a rule, competitive marketing agencies must work much harder to connect with their customers. Now, it’s much more difficult to reach mass audiences due to fragmentation from the mobile revolution. As media channels have proliferated across TV networks, streaming, social media, search, and more, it has become increasingly difficult to determine which audiences to target on which channels. Agencies like WPP have a complicated task: they must target 10, sometimes 15, different audiences at the same time and optimize investments across all of them. Delivering on this industry need requires a competitive advantage by providing increasingly innovative solutions to evolving customer needs.

There is more to that complicated task—employee knowledge and creativity is WPP’s best IP and they’re competing with other companies such as Google to hire and retain top creative talent.  To further innovation often initiated by talented hires, it’s critical to prioritize retention by providing employees with the support, resources, and culture needed to thrive. Creating channels for feedback and continuous improvement can also increase visibility into the concerns and ideas from employees.

Additionally, WPP has over 80 agencies operating in 110 different countries. They’ve also acquired over 54 companies since inception. For these reasons, effective collaboration and streamlined knowledge sharing across more than 100,000 employees is a daunting task.

WPP needed a way to bridge the innovative ideas and best practices across employees, agencies, and locations to eliminate duplicative work and empower people in different places to build on top of other’s ideas.

## Questions for consideration

* How could WPP best utilize their different teams to achieve a unified strategy for innovation?
* Digitalization and AI are growing trends across industries. How could marketing companies like WPP approach marrying technology and creativity to create more business value for their clients?
* How can companies interested in creating a collaborative environment make innovation spaces more accessible?
* In what ways can companies encourage a culture of collaboration to ensure their initiatives both solve existing problems and have legs for long-term success?

Now let’s watch WPP’s video to learn how they addressed their industry need to deliver more targeted marketing strategies.
