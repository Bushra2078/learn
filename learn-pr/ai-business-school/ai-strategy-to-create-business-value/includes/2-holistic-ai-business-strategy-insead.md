AI is important for the future evolution of business and our broader society. Peter Zemsky explains that while there is significant ongoing investment in AI from major technology companies, there remain those who see AI as a threat rather than an opportunity. The complexity underpinning AI is sometimes seen as intimidating, which becomes its own barrier to exploring how AI can be leveraged in business, and how organizations can strategically select the right use cases for adopting AI as a part of creating an AI strategy. Peter Zemsky suggests building a high-level understanding of AI to remove that barrier. The case studies in this module are a great place to start.
