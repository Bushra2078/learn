As you just heard, when managing an innovation group, it’s important for organizations to create a multi-disciplinary group that focuses on learning rather than revenue. It’s also important to keep key stakeholders informed throughout the innovation process and find customers who are willing to explore new solutions with you.

Rimes Mortimer points out that business leaders play a critical role in driving innovation. “You have to be inspirational and you have to set a vision that people can buy into and believe can be achieved,” he says. To be successful, business leaders must commit to putting the time and resources into cultivating this innovation across the organization.

Mortimer also discusses the book *The Innovator’s Dilemma* by Clayton Christensen. In the book, Christensen highlights that organizations often fail because they don’t innovate beyond their core competencies. Addressing this concern means leaders must invest in disruptive technologies even when they don’t see immediate return on investment.

Next, let’s look at some key factors organizations need to consider as they evaluate and prioritize AI investments.
