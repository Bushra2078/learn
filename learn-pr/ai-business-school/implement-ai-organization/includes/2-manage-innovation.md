How do companies keep up as industries evolve? The answer is innovation. 

Even if companies "do everything right" with their existing business models, they'll lose competitiveness if they don't embrace innovative disruptions.<sup>1</sup> Indeed, 52 percent of Fortune 500 companies have either been acquired, gone bankrupt, or ceased to exist since 2000.<sup>2</sup>  

The capacity to pivot as a business and foster innovation is crucial to long-term success. Innovative companies generally lead their industry's market share, attract top talent, and create cutting-edge products and services.

In this unit, we'll share some guidance on how to be an innovative organization. We approach innovation in three key ways at Microsoft: 

* Enable a culture of meaningful innovation.
* Strategically apply innovation to real business challenges.
* Keep responsibility at the center throughout the innovation process.

## Enable a culture of meaningful innovation

"Meaningful" innovation means innovation with a purpose – not just innovation for its own sake. We aim to set the foundation for meaningful innovation by fostering an innovative mindset across the company. We also have a business group dedicated to solving difficult problems through technological innovation. 

### Foster an innovative mindset across the organization

In our experience, leading an innovative company requires more than just R&D. The most innovative companies today foster a culture that empowers employees to explore new ideas. This is largely dependent on the willingness of forward-thinking leadership to encourage experimentation, trial and error, collaboration, and creativity. It's important to acknowledge failure as a valuable part of continual learning and innovation.

### Establish a business group dedicated to innovation

Over 25 years ago, we established a wing of the company dedicated solely to innovation: Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research (MSR) spans eight labs around the world and supports over 1000 researchers. By design, they're free to pursue new ideas without the burden of daily business operations or fear of failure.

To help MSR be successful, we hire people from a wide range of disciplines, not just technology experts. We encourage both "curiosity-driven" research focused on general scientific advancement and "deployment-driven" research connected to real-world business challenges.

Throughout the innovation process, we encourage alignment between researchers and senior leadership. One way we do this is through bi-annual all-day meetings called Disruptive Technology Reviews (DTRs). DTRs allow researchers to relay their latest and greatest findings. Senior leadership can then use the information to inform existing product roadmaps and identify new business opportunities. Many projects presented at DTRs over the years, like Xiaoice and Azure Sphere, are now Microsoft products or part of products today.

With a culture of meaningful innovation, your organization can dream big. The next step is to translate your vision and research into reality.

## Strategically apply innovation to real business challenges

It can sometimes be challenging to connect R&D with real-world business needs. To help overcome this obstacle, we've found three ways to bridge the gap. The first is making sure employees on the ground can share ideas related to their jobs. The second is to test prototypes from R&D in the market. The last is to ensure research projects are measured and kept on track.

### Involve all employees in identifying solutions to business problems

We've found it beneficial to foster a company culture where employees across all departments and levels are empowered to share their ideas. Companies who embrace this culture demonstrate a three-pronged approach to this:

* **Learning:** allow every employee to share their ideas and knowledge openly.    * At Microsoft, we have many processes for identifying and funding new ideas. In one program, a small "seed" team delivers a start-up style pitch as if they were an external company. If approved, the team is allocated initial funding and resources to begin building out their solution. If concepts and prototypes are validated, projects can be scaled with additional funding and headcount to bring an idea to fruition. If the project doesn't move forward, the team can focus efforts elsewhere. Whatever the outcome, it's important to reward all efforts, even failures, so people want to continue experimenting. In this sense, we acknowledge failure as a valuable part of innovation that provides direction for future learnings and fuels constant innovation.
* **Enablement:** help employees come up with outstanding ideas through professional development. This entails providing the time, space, and resources for career and technical training. For example, one of the initiatives we've set up is called The Garage. This is a designated innovation space where employees can spark creativity and freely experiment.
* **Sharing:** facilitate cross-departmental idea-sharing where people with different backgrounds and expertise can discuss each other's challenges and innovative ideas. We host different kinds of events to encourage intellectual sharing, including our annual global Hackathon. We also make sure that teams share their breakthroughs across the company through blogs and whitepapers.

### Incubate disruptive business solutions

To determine if there is actual market potential for new ideas, we have a multi-disciplinary team focused on incubating solutions for Microsoft, partners, and customers. This team works closely with product groups to evaluate the technology itself and the business value it brings. While the intent is to achieve mainstream success with each solution, the team still benefits from projects that fail since they inform future efforts.

### Measure research projects by their business impact

Turn moon shot ideas into actionable steps by having regular reviews and feedback loops. This will prove a project's value and ensure it's on track. Helpful KPIs to measure against may include new IP and patents, new customer or partner connections, improved enablement, and updates to a product group strategy.

## Keep responsibility at the center throughout the innovation process

We believe responsible innovation is less about what technology can do and more about what it should do.

At Microsoft, we've recognized six principles that we believe should guide AI development and use: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. We've also established our own governing practices for responsible AI. This includes forming governing bodies, developing AI policies, and providing engineering teams with actionable guidance and tools.
