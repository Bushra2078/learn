## Introduction

The economics of investing in "traditional" technology initiatives are well understood. Typically, when an organization is deciding whether to proceed with an IT project, they compare the cost with the net present value (NPV) of the benefits. If the NPV is greater than zero and fits within the budget constraints, the project receives a green light.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) changes all of that. It's true that if you leverage AI to improve or automate an existing process, then it's possible to measure ROI in a straightforward, traditional way. But there are a few characteristics of AI initiatives that make it difficult to estimate their costs and benefits.

First, AI models often require upfront investments before it's possible to measure effectiveness. To create a new model, data scientists need to gather and clean training data, train the model with algorithms, and then test and tune it for accuracy. Only then can you accurately measure how it will benefit your organization.

Additionally, AI models will improve over time in ways that are difficult to calculate in advance, and the amount of long-term maintenance they'll need is hard to predict. All models require ongoing monitoring and periodic tuning, but more extensive retraining can be required if circumstances around the initiative change—such as business processes being revamped or the customer market changing significantly.

Finally, the real value of AI lies in business transformation: driving new business models, enabling innovative services, creating new revenue streams, and more. For example: in the retail space, personalized offers fundamentally change how retailers interact with their customers, where and when they distribute products, and what types of skill sets they need to hire for. The widespread and complex business impacts of these solutions make it challenging to estimate all their monetary costs and benefits from the outset.

With AI initiatives, you need to think like a venture capitalist. That means being willing to invest and take risks without being blocked by uncertainties. But you don't have to shoot in the dark—you'll need a framework to help prioritize AI investments. In the following sections, we'll describe how to:

* Leverage a horizon-based framework for evaluating initiatives
* Map scenarios and use cases to the framework  
* Prioritize investments in phases  
* Define clear value drivers and KPIs

## Leverage a horizon-based framework

At Microsoft, we use a "horizon-based" framework to evaluate and prioritize AI investments. This groups AI projects into three "horizons," from improving core business functions to creating brand new revenue streams. The risk and uncertainty of specific applications depends on a company's level of AI maturity, size, business objectives, and more.

### Horizon 1: Running (Operate and Optimize the Core Business)

Not every AI application involves a revolutionary, change-your-business approach. In fact, using AI to improve or automate existing processes is becoming essential to remaining competitive.  

Horizon 1 (H1) represents AI initiatives that optimize core business functions and those that provide the main source of profits and cash flow. For example: perhaps you manufacture electronic components of some kind. While you might manually inspect quality for 100 parts per hour, an AI model with image recognition capabilities could inspect 1,000 parts per hour.

### Horizon 2: Growing (Improve Market Position)

Horizon 2 (H2) encompasses initiatives that take advantage of emerging opportunities, including new ventures likely to generate growth and enhance performance in established markets. These initiatives might create new digital products and services or enable new customer experiences. For example, a manufacturer of production machines might use IoT to collect operational data and AI to suggest optimal times for maintenance. This facilitates a brand-new customer experience and helps the manufacturer differentiate from competitors.

### Horizon 3: Transforming (Change Market Position)

Horizon 3 (H3) involves disruptive and innovative new business models. These are revolutionary applications that might cross industry boundaries or even create new customer needs.

For example, a chemical manufacturer could sell "fertilizer-as-a-service"—which means they use AI models to predict changing environmental conditions and distribute fertilizer to farmers proactively. Ultimately, the company is selling a personalized service rather than a single product, creating new revenue streams and opportunities.

## Map scenarios and use cases to the framework

Using this framework, you can then map AI scenarios into quadrants. The "tactical" spectrum represents initiatives that confined to a single team or use cases. The "strategic" side represents larger business initiatives that might impact the entire organization.

To use a retail example, you might place location-based targeted advertising in the upper left quadrant. It's an initiative that digitizes and optimizes an existing business model without requiring systemic changes to the organization. 

Scenarios that fall below the middle line help the organization "survive," more than thrive. They might address competitive and disruptive threats, improve operations, or empower employees in the organization. Scenarios above the middle line help com help companies identify new value propositions. They might create new revenue streams with different business models and usually require new budgets. 

As you map initiatives, it's helpful to involve the CFO office and other stakeholders to ensure you've made the right assumptions around the opportunity valuation.

## Prioritize investments and organize phases

We recommend prioritizing initiatives in phases: start with the most foundational initiatives in the bottom left and move towards transformational initiatives at the top right.

We recommend this approach because it's helpful to grow capabilities and get buy-in before moving on to more complex projects. You'll need to form technical teams that can prepare data properly and familiarize themselves with AI models. You'll also need to establish trust across the business and manage expectations related to AI initiatives. The success and value you're able to demonstrate in early initiatives pave the way for the more transformational H2 and H3 projects. 

Another reason to start at the bottom left is that the technology used to support H1 AI models is typically more accessible than advanced use cases. For example, there are countless out-of-the-box and pre-trained AI models you can leverage for common use cases. These applications cost less and their impact on the business is easier to estimate. As you build ML maturity with these accessible models, you can start experimenting with more complex AI initiatives and hone your objectives.  

H2 and H3 initiatives require more sophisticated data science capabilities and unproven technologies, which may result in unintended or unexpected outcomes. These initiatives may require businesses to work with outside partners to create a custom model that can't be bought off the shelf. Achieving a lasting competitive advantage requires creating value with AI in ways that can't be easily duplicated by others. These solutions will require the most resources, time, and risk, but they can offer the greatest reward.

## Define Clear Value Drivers and KPIs For Your AI Investments

Once you've prioritized your AI initiatives, it's important to identify value drivers and KPIs for each project. The framework below provides a useful way to think about any investment—including AI initiatives.

-Add in table

As you make investments in initiatives like predictive maintenance, it's important to develop market and financial models to help you balance potential return and risk. You can consider factors such as the total addressable market (TAM), net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). Work with CFO office and other key stakeholders to ensure the financial models make sense within the context of the larger business. This is helpful to get their buy-in and ensure support throughout the process as well. 

Moving forward, we advise putting systemic processes in place to manage and evaluate value throughout the project lifecycle. We recommend taking an agile approach that happens in stages—after you invest in an initiative, evaluate the initial results. This way, you can determine whether you want to continue, adjust your approach, or go down another path. Do this at major milestones throughout the project.

## Conclusion

AI is already transforming industries, and the potential business value it can generate will only continue to grow. Because the old paradigm of predictable and linear investments doesn't always apply, we need a new, creative framework to evaluate and prioritize initiatives. Equipped with the right framework, you'll have strong foundation for innovation, and ultimately realize the massive promise of AI.  

With the horizon framework, you can map the value of AI initiatives relative to your own business. This enables you to:

* Assess potential opportunities for growth  
* Prioritize AI initiatives in a way that makes sense for your business, considering return versus risk 
* Invest in AI initiatives confidently, considering the uncertainties 
* Develop people and talent to build the right capabilities for long-term success 
* Involve stakeholders throughout the process 
* Manage your investments throughout the project lifecycle

Beyond just maximizing the business value of AI, it's also important to keep responsible AI practices in mind as you move forward.
