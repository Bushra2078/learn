How do companies keep up as industries evolve? The answer is innovation.

Even if companies "do everything right" with respect to their existing business models, they will lose competitiveness if they don't embrace innovative disruptions. Indeed, 52 percent of Fortune 500 companies from year 2000 have either been acquired, gone bankrupt, or ceased to exist.

The capacity to pivot as a business and foster innovation is crucial to long-term success. Innovative companies generally lead their industry's market share, attract top talent, and create cutting-edge products and services.

In this unit, we'll share some guidance on how to be an innovative organization. We approach innovation in three key ways at Microsoft:

1. Enable a culture of meaningful innovation
2. Strategically apply innovation to real business challenges
3. Keep responsibility at the center throughout the innovation process

## Enable a culture of meaningful innovation

When we say "meaningful" innovation, we mean that the innovation has a purpose â€“ it's not just innovation for its own sake. To make that possible, we aim to set the foundation by fostering an innovative mindset across the company. We also have a business group dedicated to solving difficult problems through technological innovation.

### Foster an innovative mindset across the organization

In our experience, leading an innovative company requires more than just R&D. The most innovative companies today foster a culture where employees are empowered to explore new ideas and create new business opportunities. This is largely dependent on the willingness of forward-thinking leadership to encourage experimentation, trial and error, collaboration, and creativity. It's important to acknowledge failure as a valuable part of continual learning and innovation.

### Establish a business group dedicated to innovation

Over 25 years ago, we established a wing of the company dedicated solely to innovation: Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research (MSR) spans eight labs around the world and supports over 1000 researchers. By design, they're free to pursue new ideas without the burden of daily business operations or fear of failure.

To help MSR be successful, we hire people from a wide range of disciplines, not just technology experts. We encourage both "curiosity-driven" research focused on general scientific advancement and "deployment-driven" research connected to real-world business challenges.

To encourage alignment between researchers and senior leadership, we have bi-annual all-day meetings called Disruptive Technology Reviews (DTRs). DTRs allow researchers to relay their latest and greatest findings. Senior leadership can then use the information to inform existing product roadmaps and identify new business opportunities. Many projects presented at DTRs over the years, like Xiaoice and Azure Sphere, are now Microsoft products or part of products today.

With a culture of meaningful innovation, your organization can dream big. The next step is to translate your vision and research into reality.

## Strategically apply innovation to real business challenges

It can sometimes be challenging to connect R&D with real-world business needs. To help overcome this obstacle, we've found three ways to bridge the gap. The first is making sure people "on-the-ground" can share and execute solutions related to their jobs. The second is by focusing on incubating new businesses and solutions. The last is to ensure research projects are measured and kept on track.

### Involve all employees in identifying solutions to business problems

We've found it beneficial to foster a company culture where employees across all departments and levels are empowered to share their ideas. We take a three-pronged approach to stimulating and collecting ideas from employees:

* Learning: allow every employee to share their ideas and knowledge openly.
   * A prime example is The Innovation Pipeline (TIP) built by AT&T. As one of the largest crowdsourcing programs, TIP encourages ideas from all employees and helps the best ones rise to the top. Ten years since its inception, 130,000 employees across 54 countries have submitted over 50,000 ideas. These ideas have transformed over 100 projects into real products and services that benefit the company and its customers.
   * At Microsoft, we have multiple processes for identifying and funding new ideas. An example of a popular process begins with a small "seed" team that delivers a start-up style pitch as if they were an external company. If approved, the team is allocated initial funding and resources to begin building out their solution. If concepts and prototypes are validated, projects can be scaled with additional funding and headcount to bring an idea to fruition. If the project doesn't move forward, the team can focus efforts elsewhere. Regardless of the outcome, it is important to reward all efforts, even failures, so people want to continue experimenting. In this sense, we acknowledge failure as a valuable part of innovation that provides direction for future learnings and fuels constant innovation.
* Enablement: help employees come up with outstanding ideas by providing career and technical training as well as the time and space to prioritize professional development. For example, one of the initiatives we've set up is called The Garage. This is a designated innovation space where employees can spark creativity and freely experiment.
* Sharing: facilitate cross-departmental idea-sharing where people with different backgrounds and expertise can discuss each other's challenges, innovative ideas, and breakthroughs. We host a variety of events to encourage intellectual sharing, including our annual global Hackathon. Blogs and whitepapers are also useful modes to share failures, successes, and IP between teams, organizations, and the world.

### Incubate new business opportunity powered by emerging technology

Focusing on disruptive innovations across multiple industries allows for the creation of next-generation solutions. At Microsoft, we have a dedicated incubation team to help validate and prototype ideas to determine if there is actual market potential. This team is invested by multiple parties in order to inform cross-disciplinary IP and scale business if there is clear value. While the intent for incubation solutions is to achieve mainstream scale, fast fails are equally rewarded for the directional research it provides.

### Measure research projects by their business impact

Turn moon shot ideas into actionable steps by having regular reviews and feedback loops to prove a project's value and ensure it's on track. Helpful KPIs to measure against may include new IP and patents, new customer or partner connections, improved enablement, and updates to a product group strategy.

## Keep responsibility at the center throughout the innovation process

We believe responsible innovation is less about what technology can do and more about what it should do.

At Microsoft, we've recognized six principles that we believe should guide AI development and use: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

We've also established our own governing practices for responsible AI. This includes forming governing bodies, developing AI policies, and providing engineering teams with actionable guidance and tools. Our still-evolving governance system leverages what we've learned from our privacy and cybersecurity efforts, and collaboration with other organizations.
