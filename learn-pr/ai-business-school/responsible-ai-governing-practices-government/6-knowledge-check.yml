      explanation: "Incorrect. While AI can be a controversial topic, this doesn't necessitate a multistakeholder approach."
    - content: "AI is a complicated technology, so it requires many experts to inform discussions regarding its regulation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While AI is a complicated and nuanced topic, this doesn't necessitate a multistakeholder approach."
    - content: "AI is an emergent technology and it’s being implemented in new ways. Because it’s self-learning and autonomous, AI requires careful oversight and input from many different experts."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. As governments implement AI in new ways, it affects a plethora of stakeholders, necessitating a diversity of perspectives in these discussions."
    - content: "AI is an emergent technology, so there are only a few established best practices for implementing it in government scenarios, requiring input from many different experts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While there are just a few established best practices for implementing AI in government scenarios, this doesn't necessitate a multistakeholder approach."

    choices:
    - content: "Governments should tailor their responsible AI governance model to reflect their national priorities and culture."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It's important that governments take their nation’s priorities and culture into account when customizing their responsible AI governance model."
    - content: "Governments should tailor their responsible AI governance model to reflect the needs of their biggest businesses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The needs of the private sector shouldn't solely dictate how a government customizes their responsible AI governance model."
    - content: "Governments should tailor their responsible AI governance model to reflect the desires of their leader."

      explanation: "Incorrect. The desires of a nation’s head of state shouldn't solely dictate how a government customizes their responsible AI governance model."
    - content: "Governments don't have to tailor their responsible AI governance model, they can implement a model used by another nation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Every nation is different, so every government should customize their responsible AI governance model to reflect national priorities and culture."
  - content: "What is the key advantage of a hybrid governance model?"
    choices:
    - content: "A hybrid governance model ensures all agencies adhere to the same strict guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A hybrid model provides agencies with key guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment but doesn't provide strict rules like a centralized model does."
    - content: "A hybrid governance model empowers individual agencies to completely create their own standards and policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A hybrid model provides agencies with key guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment. A decentralized model allows individual agencies to create their own standards."
    - content: "A hybrid governance model provides individual agencies with a set of guiding principles to ensure alignment but empowers them to execute on their own projects, enabling rapid innovation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Unlike a centralized model that delivers strict guidelines to all agencies or a decentralized model that allows agencies to create their own standards, a hybrid model provides key guidelines for all agencies and allows them to execute on their projects as they see fit."
    - content: "A hybrid governance model provides different guidelines to different agencies based on their needs, enabling rapid innovation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A hybrid model provides agencies with consistent key guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment but empowers them to execute on their projects as they see fit."
  - content: "Why is it important for AI policy development to be agile?"
    choices:

    - content: "AI policies need to be flexible in order to meet enterprise needs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Requests from enterprises shouldn't dictate AI policy."
    - content: "AI policies need to be flexible in order to reflect changes in public opinion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While important, public opinion shouldn't dictate AI policy on its own as it can be manipulated, misinformed, and erratic."
    - content: "AI policies need to be flexible in order to match the policies of governments who are leading in AI."
