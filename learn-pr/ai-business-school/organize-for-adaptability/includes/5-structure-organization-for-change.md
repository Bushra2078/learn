Resiliency in business often equates to the ability to innovate through times of rapid change—to pivot how, where, and when we make progress in a world where the unthinkable seems to dictate all the rules.

Case in point: the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally transformed the way we work, do business, and meet customer needs. But these past 18 months have also taught us something about ourselves—that we can accomplish so much more remotely than we ever thought possible.

## Mapping organizational resilience

As we covered earlier in this module, understanding the relationship between people, practices, and outcomes is crucial to organizational resilience. With the onset of the pandemic, this has never been clearer.

In early 2020, all but the most essential in-person operations were thrown into what was perceived to be a temporary remote work environment. We now know a hybrid work force is nearly guaranteed for the future. So what do you need to know about how new work group structures and relationships are forming?

Recently Microsoft studied how hybrid and remote work impact our own employee communications. The study shows that Microsoft employees who normally worked in the office had to quickly adopt new technologies to stay connected, while those who were already working remotely could remain stable in their technology use. This is a logical outcome and many companies around the world have experienced the same. What’s more surprising is that the data show most Microsoft employees retained their existing collaborations and expanded their networks beyond their customary workgroups. These employees did not withdraw from informal connections built on hallway conversations or desk chats. Instead, these working groups *shifted* how they connected—and so, they *stayed* connected.

Building on this single-company view, we expanded our analysis to examine the effects of the pandemic across organizations and industries. The latest Microsoft Work Trends Index describes how one such analysis incorporated 122 billion email interactions and 2.3 meeting interactions across industries and countries. The results show an overall increase in the “siloed” nature of workgroups with strong internal relationships and clear group boundaries.<sup>3</sup>

The contrasting research findings represent more than just the varied impact of a change in venue. Siloed workgroups can form quickly, but it’s possible to slow that pace and maintain a more widely connected workforce, which helps foster innovation. Leaders need to recognize how the shift impacts workers beyond just basic connectivity. They also need to consider how to empower employees, engage customers, optimize operations, and transform products, all while recognizing hybrid and remote work as the new status quo.

As you can see, rethinking the relationship between remote work groups and desired business outcomes is a crucial part of adapting in a way that supports resilience. But this is just one aspect of how operations are changing. As the pandemic and prior industry disruptions have shown, businesses need to be consistently thinking about how their existing business models will evolve and maybe even disrupt their industry in the future.

## Business model innovation

Watch this video from Richard Chin, Corporate Vice President, Business Planning and Commercial Licensing at Microsoft, as he shares how the company approaches the need to change its business model. Richard Chin also provides insight on how businesses should approach the search for the next big revenue opportunity.

In this video, you heard Richard Chin describe how Microsoft changed its business model from selling software to selling cloud services. He explained how the willingness to make this change helped Microsoft grow the business and add more value to the markets and customers we serve.

Ours is just one example of how growth drivers vary based on the product or service at play. But the common takeaway is that it pays to think beyond a pricing change for a single product because it creates more opportunities to cross-sell and upsell or to find new ways of bundling and packaging. Bottom line: whether you’re facing new customer expectations, supply issues caused by climate change, the integration of new technology, or the need to redesign a product—there’s a clear opportunity to stay ahead of changing market factors by proactively rethinking your business model.
