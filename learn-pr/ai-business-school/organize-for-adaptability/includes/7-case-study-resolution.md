## Approach 

HOCHTIEF’s strategy was to build a sustainable, cross-functional platform for innovation. Recognizing the traditional nature of the construction industry, they set out to digitize their company by investing in AI to create new business models and revenue streams through startup-like environments. They created two spin-off companies to help them challenge the status quo and cultivate a workplace that embraces innovation.

These two innovation arms, Nexplore and EDGITAL, create and manage cutting-edge applications that help HOCHTIEF monitor construction progress on major projects. They also keep continuous track of work quality, pinpoint potential savings with machinery, and analyze complex contracts. Nexplore functions as an innovation hub for building custom-made, AI-enabled solutions. It also works with leading tech firms and universities to develop new hardware and software applications. EDGITAL was created to drive innovation related to HOCHTIEF’s public infrastructure projects in the Public-Private Partnership business unit. Each company has the freedom to work on deployment-driven projects to launch in the near term. They’re also free to explore more curiosity-driven ideas free of timelines and other limitations.

HOCHTIEF also introduced a company-wide digital mindset with a clear communications strategy. They saw people as essential to their vision of AI. They recognized the opportunity to build new revenue streams and take the repetitiveness out of day-to-day routines. In doing so, their people could focus on value-added tasks.

In a similar vein, HOCHTIEF built diverse teams for cross-functional collaboration and organizational buy-in through collective insight. In doing so, they made space for divergent thinking and created more balance throughout their process of innovation.

## Results

The challenge to transform construction is significant. To address this, HOCHTIEF worked with several technology partners, including Microsoft, to use technology to stay agile and turn innovative ideas into business outcomes. Creating a start-up environment for innovation, building diverse teams, and establishing cross-functional collaboration enabled their AI development to be an open, rather than siloed, process, one that functions as an innovation cycle. With teams dedicated to the research and exploration of new ideas, they could successfully yield inventive AI applications.

For example, EDGITAL and Nexplore helped HOCHTIEF contract with cities to plan road maintenance more efficiently. Their AI solution allows engineers to inspect roads continuously and safely, while also unlocking new revenue streams. Nexplore has about 20 projects, both underway and planned for future dates. These include the use of autonomous trucks on construction projects—already in use in Australia—and blockchain in administrative processes.

HOCHTIEF has used innovation to transform their traditional business operations for contract analysis to provide better services to customers and reduce business costs. They’ve created business value by using AI to monitor the quality of their materials—such as concrete used on projects—and ultimately make the supply chain more efficient.

To further drive their success with AI innovation, HOCHTIEF established metrics that enabled them to evaluate their AI implementations. These metrics included reduction of work hours, efficiency of work, and risk reduction. With these changes, HOCHTIEF gained continued organizational buy-in and fostered an environment of support for innovation.

The construction industry is fragmented, meaning smaller and mid-sized firms can’t always afford to make significant investments in AI. Recognizing this, HOCHTIEF decided to change the operational model by including smaller companies and empowering them with AI, further disrupting the industry as a whole.

## Key lessons

### Foster an environment of continuous innovation

Part of what makes Nexplore and EDGITAL successful is they both function like startups, which enables HOCHTIEF to foster a culture of continuous innovation. Because the spin-off companies are dedicated solely to innovation, they have the freedom to work on deployment-driven projects to launch in the near term. They’re also able to explore more curiosity-driven ideas free of timelines and other limitations.

### Clear communication as key tool

HOCHTIEF introduced a company-wide digital mindset with a clear communications strategy. This was essential for creating a start-up environment for innovation, building diverse teams, and establishing cross-functional collaboration. In turn, these successes enabled their AI development to be an open, rather than siloed, process, one that functions as an innovation cycle.

HOCHTIEF’s story is a great example of how businesses harness innovation through startup-like environments to revolutionize existing processes, develop new services, and disrupt the construction industry.
