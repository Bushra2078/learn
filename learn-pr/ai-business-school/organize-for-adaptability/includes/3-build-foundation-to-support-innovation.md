We know that some of the most influential innovations come from people of all backgrounds and at all levels of an organization. To that end, getting everyone involved is one of the most important steps you can take to show that innovation matters—and providing the right level of encouragement will be key. But how does that translate into an actual work environment? And how do you sort and nurture everyone’s ideas from concept to product in a way that is financially profitable and fair? How do you decide which ideas won’t make the cut?  

The answer is to carefully construct an *innovation architecture* that includes strategic direction and programs that allow ideas to build momentum—because it’s often that exact momentum that makes your business resilient during times of change.

## Encourage collaboration and provide safe spaces to experiment and fail

There’s no question that organizations that embrace innovation have an advantage over competitors—but getting there requires buy-in at every level. As we mentioned earlier, the right type of encouragement is paramount to getting people involved. You can encourage people from across the organization by providing the resources, technology, and skill-building needed to innovate effectively. If this is new and unfamiliar territory, there are actions you can take to create the optimal environment for innovation.

* Give employees time, space, and incentives for experimentation.
* Offer seed funds for start-up style pitches and consider potential additional funding, if needed.
* Focus on learning through failures and wins—a practice that helps employees understand that innovation is an iterative process.
* Sponsor lectures, trainings, and workshops on both technical and non-technical topics.
* Offer sharing sessions in which employees present a lecture series to others on topics of expertise.  
* Organize a small-scale hackathon or an idea generation contest.

The ideas are endless and most can be tailored to match your organization’s budget. No matter the chosen path, if you provide the space, resources, and time, the potential added business value is significant—perhaps even more so when cross-disciplinary teams collaborate in unexpected ways. When teams come together, people build off of others’ ideas and expertise, setting the stage for the next big success.

Notably, providing consistent support and follow-through will be critical for success. When people feel prepared to collaborate and are given the right tools and support, adaptability becomes a natural part of the workflow. Then, disruptions become manageable and businesses keep moving forward.

## Leverage a horizon-based framework

Once the ideas begin to flow, expectations and questions naturally arise, so having a plan for addressing everyone’s ideas will be important. One way to evaluate and prioritize ideas is by using a horizon-based framework. A common framework is McKinsey’s Three Horizons Model<sup>2</sup>, which groups projects into three "horizons," from improving core business functions to creating brand new revenue streams. The risk and uncertainty of specific applications depends on a company's level of maturity, size, business objectives, and more.

* Horizon 1 represents initiatives that optimize existing business models and **core business functions** in the short term.
* Horizon 2 initiatives take advantage of **emerging opportunities** to expand to new markets and customers.
* Horizon 3 involves disruptive and innovative **new business models** that focus on future timelines.

The Three Horizons Model is an enduring framework that’s useful when establishing an innovation architecture because it’s formulated around people, processes, and outcomes. However, it relies on time as a core guiding value, with the assumption that breakthrough innovations take years of development. As you think through your own innovation architecture, it’s worth considering that technology has changed the dynamic of time.

Today, many would-be Horizon 3 disruptions can be rapidly implemented by repurposing existing Horizon 1 technologies into new products and business models. That increased speed of deployment itself is disruptive.

Competition moves at a breakneck pace. In this landscape, disruptors that attack the market have gained the advantage. While a horizon-based framework provides an excellent foundation for how to think about innovation prioritization, it’s important to adapt the model’s time frames to fit your organization’s objectives.  

Now let’s examine how your organization’s data can help lay the groundwork for successful innovation.
