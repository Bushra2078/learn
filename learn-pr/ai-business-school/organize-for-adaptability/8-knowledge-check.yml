  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements is the recommended method for sorting and prioritizing your employees’ innovative ideas?"
    choices:
    - content: "Pursuing only the most cost-efficient ideas."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Budgetary factors are important, but choosing ideas based solely on up-front cost overlooks the potential ROI down the line."
    - content: "Using a horizon-based framework to group ideas into priority categories."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A horizon-based framework such as McKinsey’s Three Horizon Model allows leadership to prioritize ideas based on predetermined categories, creating an impartial and consistent manner for pursuing ideas."
    - content: "Only choosing ideas that accelerate time to market for projects already underway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Focusing only on timelines increases the risk of moving too quickly, creating more space for error and overlooking potential improvements."
    - content: "Only choosing ideas that are closely aligned with your current products and services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Innovation is about branching out to include new ideas. Focusing only on current projects overlooks potential for disrupting the market with the next big breakthrough."
  - content: "Which of the following statements represents an actionable way to encourage widespread innovation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Offering seed funds for only the highest-ranking employees."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Without adequate funding for all levels of the organization, employees can't pursue innovative ideas to fruition. Companies should consider additional funding for ideas that hold significant potential, even if they come from junior employees."
    - content: "Sponsoring lectures, trainings, and workshops on both technical and non-technical topics."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Providing hands-on learning opportunities is critical for engaging employees to understand all the ways innovation can be applied to their own work, which includes both technical and non-technical positions. Innovation doesn’t just apply to IT or engineering, but to every division of business."
    - content: "Organizing small-scale events that are only open to select individuals or to a single division of the company."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Opening up social opportunities to all members of the workforce gives you a better chance of discovering the next big idea. Meaningful innovation happens in every division and among all employees. Hackathons and idea generation contests are just two ideas for encouraging innovation, and these events can include employees from across the entire business. They can also be organized remotely."
    - content: "Tabling ideas that fail to produce the desired results after the first iteration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It’s important for all employees to understand that taking risk and celebrating failure are both common and expected aspects of innovation. Failures should be celebrated and built upon, not shunned."
  - content: "HOCHTIEF revolutionized the construction industry with their spin-off companies Nexplore and EDGITAL. What was unique about the spin-offs that helped HOCHTIEF succeed?"
    choices:
    - content: "They functioned entirely as start-ups."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Nexplore and EDGITAL were designed with start-up mentality, giving both spin-offs the freedom to pursue deployment-driven projects to launch in the near term, as well as to explore more curiosity-driven ideas free of timelines and other limitations."
    - content: "They focused on projects outside of the construction industry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Nexplore and EDGITAL create applications that help HOCHTIEF monitor progress, track of work quality, pinpoint savings, analyze contracts, and more. While they function as different companies, they still help HOCHTIEF explore and strengthen different areas of their construction business."
    - content: "They put technology before creativity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Nexplore and EDGITAL shared a start-up mentality that allowed them to apply creative ideas to improve technological solutions. It was both technology and an outside-the-box approach that helped reshape the construction industry."
    - content: "They didn’t engage in partnerships, allowing them to maintain more focus on internal operations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. EDGITAL and Nexplore engaged in public and private partnerships to improve infrastructure maintenance and safety, which helped them unlock new revenue streams."
  - content: "Which of the following ideas describes the basis for a strong innovation architecture?"
    choices:
    - content: "A centrally located headquarters that passes and maintains building codes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While physical space can be important for developing innovative ideas, innovation architecture is about maintaining programs and other resources that support employees’ efforts to innovate."
    - content: "A lean organizational budget that focuses only on short-term needs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It’s important to allocate funds specifically for innovation projects, even if they won’t produce tangible outcomes until a future date."
    - content: "Strategic direction, programs, and common language set by leadership."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Establishing a strong innovation architecture is all about providing strategic direction and programs, as well as common language, so everyone can innovate under fair guidelines that support both employees and the business."
