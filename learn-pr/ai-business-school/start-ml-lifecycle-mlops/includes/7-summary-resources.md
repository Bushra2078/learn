MLOps practices facilitate better business results, enable faster time to market, and accelerate experimentation. These practices also increase collaboration and alignment across teams and help assure model quality and auditabilityâ€”ultimately accelerating the ML lifecycle.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Identify the different steps of the ML lifecycle.
* Describe how to create and manage machine learning models using MLOps processes.
* Articulate processes to monitor models and respond to incidents.
