  questions: 
  - content: "In a LUIS app, what is the purpose of an utterance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Represents a task or action the user wants to perform "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "In LUIS terminology, this definition represents an Intent."
    - content: "Utterances are input from the user that your app needs to interpret"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An utterance is equivalent to a phrase a user might employ to interact with the application such as, 'Book a flight to New York'."
    - content: "Represents a word or phrase inside the Intent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is definition of an entity and is actually found in an utterance, which ultimately is a part of the entity, but is only assigned in an utterance."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the 'None' Intent?"
    choices:
    - content: "Used when a user sends null requests"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Null requests are not technically relevant in the case of interaction with a LUIS app for the purpose of Intents."
    - content: "Used to remove spaces at  beginning and end of utterances"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no provision to remove blank spaces from utterances that are sent to the applicaiton."
    - content: "Random utterances that donâ€™t map to any of your intents may be mapped to 'None'."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, it serves as a catch-all for utterances that don't map to existing Intents."
