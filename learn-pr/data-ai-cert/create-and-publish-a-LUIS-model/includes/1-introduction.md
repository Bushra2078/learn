A key factor in AI applications is the ability for a computer, or computer application, to interact intelligently with the user. One of the first, and likely most common, interaction is through the use of a Bot. You can build conversational intelligence into your bot through the use of Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS). 

LUIS is an Azure Cognitive Service API that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information.
