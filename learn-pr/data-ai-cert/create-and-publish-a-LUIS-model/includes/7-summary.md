Language Understanding service (LUIS) allows your application to understand what a person wants in their own words. LUIS uses machine learning to allow developers to build applications that can receive user input in natural language and extract meaning from it.

In this module you've created a simple LUIS application using a starter key, added some intents, utterances, and entities to test interaction with a user.  The foundation for building this LUIS application was for integration into a bot application.  You can integrate LUIS into your own AI applications, using the API documentation to understand how to perform that integration.
