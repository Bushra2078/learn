In this module, you will learn about the machine learning pipeline and how the Azure Machine Learning service's AutoML can automate some of the laborious parts of it. You will create Python code that uses the AutoML service to find the best model for your experiment. Then you will test the model using Python code.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Understand the machine learning pipeline
- Understand Azure Machine Learning service AutoML
- Create a Python script that uses the Azure Machine Learning service's AutoML to recommend a model
- Test the recommended model from your Python script
