You learned that the Azure Machine Learning service provides callable services to scale, monitor, and deploy machine learning models. It is meant to augment and extend the data science pipeline with integrated Azure services. By using the Azure Machine Learning service SDK, you can use any of the services you need when you need them. Start your model development on your local machine with the Python tools and open-source frameworks of your choice. Then use Azure Machine Learning service via Python modules to speed up model training and evaluation, hyper parameter tuning, and deployment complete with a callable REST API. You learned how the Azure Machine Learning service is applied to various steps of the data science process to create an automated machine learning pipeline. You learned how to create an Azure ML workspace using the portal and directly in your Python script. The workspace is a container for the objects needed for your experiments.
