Because the names are similar, it's important to distinguish between Azure Machine Learning Studio and the Azure Machine Learning service. While both aid in developing and deploying machine learning models, they support different needs.  Azure Machine Learning Studio is a drag-and-drop visual workspace that is user-friendly and does not require any programming. It is ideal for learning data science and for small machine learning projects.

The Azure Machine Learning service provides callable services to scale, monitor, and deploy machine learning models. It is meant to augment and extend the data science pipeline with integrated Azure services. By using the Azure Machine Learning service SDK, you can use any of the services you need when you need them. Start your model development on your local machine with the Python tools and open-source frameworks of your choice. Then use the Azure Machine Learning service via Python modules to speed up model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.  The deployment service even provides a callable REST API your applications can use to score data using your model.
