In a nutshell, think containerization meets machine learning. Container technology provides a powerful way to scale and dynamically configure solutions to meet any requirements. However, data science has been slow to benefit from this emerging technology. Delivering on Microsoft's promise to enable everyone to use advanced technologies, a set of Python modules hide the complexity of configuring and maintaining containers, so data scientists can focus on developing machine learning solutions. But there's much more to the story because key services to scale data wrangling, model training, model evaluation, deployment, and model management, can easily be implemented vastly improving your ability to deliver solutions.
