  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Mike is the data engineer for Contoso and has a Data Warehouse created with a database named Crystal. Within the database is a table named DimSuppliers. The suppliers' information is stored in a single text file named Suppliers.txt and is 1200MB in size. It is currently stored in a container with an Azure Blob store. Your Azure SQL Data warehouse is configured as Gen 2 DW30000c. How can Mike maximize the performance of the data load? "
    choices: 
    - content: "Increase the Gen 2 DWU units."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not the correct answer. Gen 2 DW30000c is the highest limit and cannot be scaled beyond this."
    - content: "Split the text file into 60 files of 20MB each."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is the correct answer. Separating the single text file of Suppliers.txt into 60 files can take advantage of the fact that Gen 2 DW30000c uses 60 compute nodes and the parallelism of the data load can be evenly spread for quicker performance."
    - content: "Use Gen 1 DW6000."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not the correct answer. Gen 1 compute nodes has less power than Gen 2 compute nodes and will not improve the performance."

  - content: "Mike is the data engineer for Contoso and has a Data Warehouse created with a database name Crystal. He has created a master key, followed by a database scoped credential. What should he create next?"
    choices: 
    - content: "An external table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not the correct answer. Mike must have an external data source before he creates an external table."
    - content: "An external data source."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is the correct answer. Once the master key and the database scoped credential is created, Mike should create an external data source that contains a url to the Blob location and the name of the database scoped credential."
    - content: "A physical table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not the correct answer.  Mike must have an external data source and an external table before he can create a physical table."
