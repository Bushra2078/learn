Next, let's create an Azure Storage account and Blob storage container to hold the data we want to import into our data warehouse.

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise is optional. If you don't have an Azure account, or prefer not to do the exercise in your account, you can read through the instructions to understand the steps involved in creating the Blob storage container and associated storage account.

## Create an Azure Storage account

1. Select **Create a Resource**.

1. Select **Storage**, search for and select **Storage account**. Select **Create**.

1. In the **Create storage account** panel, enter the following settings:
