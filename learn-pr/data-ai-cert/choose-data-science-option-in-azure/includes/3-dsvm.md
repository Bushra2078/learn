This platform was designed to provide a virtual machine where everything within the data science process can be done.

## What is Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)?

An Azure DSVM is a customized virtual machine on Microsoft's Azure cloud. It has many popular data science tools pre-installed and pre-configured for building applications for data science. The tools include those of a business analyst, data engineer, data scientist, and developer.

## How to Use DSVM

The Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVM) provides a jumpstart for machine learning model training. To use a Windows based DSVM, you can Remote Desktop into it using the administrator credentials defined when the DSVM was created. If you are interested in learning more about how to build a model in a DSVM there are tutorials available on the VM.

For Linux based DSVMs, you can connect via on of the methods below.

1. SSH for terminal sessions
2. X2Go for graphical sessions
3. JupyterHub and JupyterLab for Jupyter notebooks

## Types of Data Science Virtual Machines

There are a few types of DSVMs that are available for different machine learning purposes. Below, we discuss briefly the options for DSVM.

### Operating Systems Supported

Both Windows and Linux are supported on a DSVM and each offer various machine learning tools. The key difference between the two servers is that Windows offers scalability with ML in SQL Server and Linux does not.

### Deep Learning Virtual Machine

A Deep Learning VM is a version of DSVM that offers a variety of deep learning tools for building artificial neural networks, which is an algorithmic process that simulates the decision process of the human neural network.

### GeoAI DSVM

This version of a DSVM includes tools specific to machine learning that related to geospatial data. It comes with other standard machine learning software, but the difference is that it includes ArcGIS, which is a commercial platform for GeoAI.

## Summary

If you are a data scientist looking to spin up an environment with numerous data science tools pre-installed, the DSVM is a good option.
