The Speech-to-text aspect of the Speech services, in Azure Cognitive Services, provides real-time translation of audio streams based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. The Speech services APIs allow developers to add end-to-end, real-time speech translations to their applications or services.

Speech-translation services are exposed through platform-independent [REST-based APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/rest-speech-to-text) or the [Speech SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk). These APIs allow you to integrate these services into any solution that requires speech translation of multiple languages.  The way in which you access these services will vary based on whether you are using the REST API or the Speech SDK.  The exercises in this module will make use of the Speech SDK.

Speech services are designed to perform real-time speech translation for scenarios like:

- Translation of live presentations
- In-person or remote translated communications
- Customer support
- Business intelligence
- Media subtitling
- Multilingual AI interactions

> [!NOTE]
> You might be aware of a similar service in Azure: the Translator Speech API. Translator Speech is a legacy API that's being replaced by the new Speech Translation API. The Translator Speech API will be available until October 2019. Learn more about how to [migrate from the Translator Speech API to the Speech Translation API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-migrate-from-translator-speech-api) before it's turned off.  Also note that if you have been using Bing Speech, it was decommissioned on October 15, 2019.   See the migration guides on docs.microsoft.com for moving your solutions to Speech Services.

The speech-to-text service defaults to using the Universal language model. This model was trained using Microsoft-owned data and is deployed in the cloud. It's optimal for conversational and dictation scenarios. When using speech-to-text for recognition and transcription in a unique environment, you can create and train custom acoustic, language, and pronunciation models. Customization is helpful for addressing ambient noise or industry-specific vocabulary.
