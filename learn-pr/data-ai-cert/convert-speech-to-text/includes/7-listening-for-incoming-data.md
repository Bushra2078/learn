Another potential use for Speech-to-Text is to perform the translation operation on incoming speech that is being heard from a microphone.  This scenario can present itself in a presentation venue where the the Speech Service provides the speech-to-text translation of the person(s) speaking, and then displays it as captions on a project screen.  In this exercise, you will see an example of listening for speech from a microphone and translating it to text output.
