The Speech to Text API transcribes audio streams into text that your application can display to the user or act upon as command input. These APIs can be used either with an SDK client library (for supported platforms and languages) or a REST API. Extend the reach of your applications across mobile, desktop, and web applications, easily power translation to and from 10 languages through the open REST interface of Speech Translator API, a cloud-based machine speech translation service.
