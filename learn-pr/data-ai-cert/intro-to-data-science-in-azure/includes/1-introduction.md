Data science is a term that has become popular in recent years with the influx of data in all areas of business. Data science is about getting valuable insights from information and answering questions by analyzing data using statistical methods, computing power, and automation. One of the core concepts behind data science is using historical data to predict the future. To do this, you use data values you know to predict something you don't know. This requires you have historical data that has both the outcome you want to predict and other data that correlates to this outcome. For example, if you want to predict the likelihood a person will default on a loan, prior history of loans that were repaid and that defaulted with related data such as income, employment status, and credit rating, may help to define a model that can predict loan defaults.  Other examples include predicting a technological problem occurring and trying to understand the patterns in types of products customers are buying. As you can see, the types of questions that can be answered through data science vary greatly. Data Science is based on probabilities so along with getting predicted outcomes, the estimated probability of the outcome is a critical consideration.

Often when a business is looking to answer a data-driven question, a set of pre-defined steps are followed known as The Data Science Process.
