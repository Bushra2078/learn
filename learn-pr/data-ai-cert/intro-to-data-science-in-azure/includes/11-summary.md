You learned that data science is a process of getting valuable information and answering questions by analyzing data with an emphasis on statistical methods, computing power, and automation. The idea is to use historical data to predict something. To do this, we use data values we know to predict something we don't know. This requires we have historical data that has both the outcome we want to predict and other data that correlates to the outcome value. You learned that the types of questions that can be answered through data science vary greatly. Data Science is based on probabilities so along with predicted outcomes, the estimated probability of the outcomes is a critical consideration. You learned that when a business is looking to answer a data-driven question, a set of pre-defined steps are followed known as The Data Science Process and what these steps involve. The process of data science includes more than one role. The roles within this process are business analyst, data engineer, data scientist, and developer. Even though there is some overlap, each of these roles are important and play a different part in the process.
