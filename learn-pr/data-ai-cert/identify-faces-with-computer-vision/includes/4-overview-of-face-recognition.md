Face **recognition** is used in many areas, including security, natural user interfaces, image analysis, mobile apps, and robotics. 

The ability to leverage artificial intelligence to perform face recognition and matching is one of the more powerful aspects of the Azure Cognitive Services Face API offering.

## Clarifying terms

To help clarify some differences between detection, and recognition, let's switch it up and by asking (and answering) are a few questions:

- Do two faces belong to the same person? This defines **verification**.
- Does this person "look like" other people? This defines **similarity**.
- Do all of these faces belong together? This defines **grouping**.
- Who is this person out of this entire group of people? This defines **identification**.

All of these aspects define the elements of face **recognition**.
