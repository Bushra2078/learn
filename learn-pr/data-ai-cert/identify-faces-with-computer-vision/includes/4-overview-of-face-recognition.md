*Facial recognition* is used in many areas, including security, natural user interfaces, image analysis, mobile apps, and robotics. 

The ability to use artificial intelligence to recognize and match faces is one of the more powerful aspects of the Face API.

## Clarifying terms

To help clarify some differences between face detection and face recognition, let's ask and answer a few questions:

- Do two images of a face belong to the same person? This defines *verification*.
- Does this person look like other people? This defines *similarity*.
- Do all of these faces belong together? This defines *grouping*.
- Who is this person in this group of people? This defines *identification*.

These are all elements of face *recognition*.
