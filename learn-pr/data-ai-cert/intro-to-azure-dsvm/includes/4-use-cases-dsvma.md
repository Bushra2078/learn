## Team collaboration

By replacing physical machines with cloud-based virtual machines, the data science team can easily and quickly create and modify a machine learning environment with the same baseline configuration. This ensures that all the data science team members have a consistent development environment.

## Training and education

A data science training class requires students to have an environment with the same software installed and configured so examples and labs work consistently. With the DSVM, the problems caused by package incompatibility and language versions are reduced. The students focus on the data science content, and the trainers don't have to spend class time debugging issues. The virtual machines can be paused or deleted, so you only pay while the machines are in use. With the DSVM, the users can even train themselves using the pre-loaded code samples.

## On-Demand elastic capacity for large-scale projects

Data science hackathons/competitions or large-scale data modeling and exploration require scaled out hardware capacity, typically for short duration. The Data Science VM can help replicate the data science environment on demand allowing experiments requiring high-powered computing resources to be run.

## Experimentation and evaluation

The Data Science VM can be used to learn about tools such as Microsoft Machine Learning Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio tools, Jupyter Notebooks, deep learning / ML toolkits, and new tools popular in the community with minimal setup. Since the Data Science VM can be set up quickly, it can be applied in short-term usage scenarios like replicating published experiments, executing demos, following walkthroughs in online sessions, and doing tutorials. Many sample scripts and data are provided to demonstrate how to use Microsoft machine learning products like SQL Server/Machine Learning Server, the Azure Machine Learning service, and Azure Cognitive Services.

## Deep learning

The DSVM can be used for training models using deep learning algorithms and GPU (Graphics processing units) based hardware can be selected upon VM creation. You can switch to a GPU-based VM when training large models or need fast computations. The Windows Server 2016 edition of DSVM comes pre-installed with GPU drivers, frameworks, and GPU versions of deep learning frameworks. On the Linux edition, deep learning on GPU is enabled on both the CentOS and Ubuntu DSVMs. You can deploy the Ubuntu, CentOS, or Windows 2016 edition of Data Science VM to a non-GPU-based Azure virtual machine in which case all of the deep learning frameworks will fall back to the CPU mode.
