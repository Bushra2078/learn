Each type of data science virtual machine is designed to support different types of machine learning, i.e. general predictive modeling, deep learning, and geospatial AI.

## Windows or Linux?

Currently, there are two different types of Azure DSVM: Windows and Linux. Azure offers a Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 version. Linux DSVMs offer Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and CentOS 7.4 versions.

## Deep learning VM

Deep learning is a popular approach when trying to tackle questions involving neural networks with large datasets. Deep learning requires specific tools to do what is required of the problem at hand. The Deep Learning DSVM comes pre-configured and pre-installed with many of these tools. Training deep learning models is computationally intense. For better model training performance, you can select a high-speed Graphics Processing Unit based machines significantly speeding up machine model training.

## Geo AI Data Science VM

This Data Science Virtual Machine has analytic capabilities optimized for geospatial and location data. It has the ArcGIS Pro Geographic Information System integrated into the virtual machine to support advanced geographic-based AI questions. It has other conventional data science tools pre-configured and pre-installed for ease-of-use.
