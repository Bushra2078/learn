  - content: "You have an Azure SQL Data Warehouse database, within this, you have a dimension table named Stores that contains store information. There is a total of 263 stores nationwide. Store information is retrieved in more than half of the queries that are issued against this database. These queries include staff information per store, sales information per store and finance information. You want to improve the query performance of these queries by configuring the table geometry of the stores table. Which is the appropriate table geometry to select for the stores table?"
