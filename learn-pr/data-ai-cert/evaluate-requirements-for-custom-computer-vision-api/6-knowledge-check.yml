  questions:
  - content: "Which of these APIs would be the best choice for making image classification predictions based on custom classification models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Custom Vision Training API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Custom Vision Training API doesn't provide custom image prediction methods."
    - content: "Computer Vision API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Computer Vision API doesn't provide custom image prediction methods."
    - content: "Custom Vision Prediction API"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Custom Vision Prediction API is specifically designed to make image classification predictions based on classification models. The Computer Vision and Custom Vision Training APIs don't provide custom image prediction methods."
  - content: "What's the minimum number images required for each tag to perform a successful training?"
    choices:
    - content: "2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Two images per tag isn't enough images for a successful training."
    - content: "5"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To perform a successful training, at least five images are required per tag. The recommended number of images per tag is 30-50, but only five are actually required. Note that two tags are required per image."
    - content: "40"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although 40 images per tag is in the recommended range, the minimum required number is less than that."
  - content: "What's the reported precision value for a model that correctly identifies 96 out of 100 images?"
    choices:
    - content: "Precise"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The term \"Precise\" is not a valid precision value."
    - content: "96%"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When a model correctly identifies 96 out of 100 images, the resulting precision is 96/100, or 96%."
    - content: "Excellent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The term \"Excellent\" is not a valid precision value. Precision is reported as a numeric ratio or percentage value, not a qualitative measure of the result."
  - content: "When you authorize requests to the Custom Vision Training API, either via the query string or the request header, which of these values do you need to supply?"
    choices:
    - content: "Subscription-Key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A generic \"Subscription-Key\" value isn't used in Azure Cognitive Vision Services."
    - content: "Training-Key"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Every programmatic call to the Custom Vision Training API requires a training key  (\"Training-Key\") to be passed to the service, either via a value in the query string parameter or specified in the request header. \"Prediction-Key\" is used for the Prediction API, and \"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\" is used for the Computer Vision, Face, and Emotion APIs. A generic \"Subscription-Key\" value isn't used in Azure Cognitive Vision Services."
    - content: "Prediction-Key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The \"Prediction-Key\" is used for the Prediction API."
  - content: "Which of these tasks would be a good fit for the Custom Vision APIs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Creating a service to identify the formats and color variations in images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Creating a service to identify image formats and color variations is a built-in feature of the Computer Vision APIs. This task isn't likely to be an effective use of the Custom Vision APIs."
    - content: "Creating a service to identify a plant species in images."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Custom Vision APIs are designed to identify tagged (classified) elements of any type of image or characteristic of an image. Creating a service to identify image formats and color variations is a built-in feature of the Computer Vision API. This task isn't likely to be an effective use of the Custom Vision APIs. The Emotion API would be used to evaluate whether the people in an image are happy or sad. This task isn't likely to be an effective use of the Custom Vision APIs."
    - content: "Creating a service to identify the textual information in images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Creating a service to extract printed text from an image is a built-in feature of the Computer Vision API. This task isn't likely to be an effective use of the Custom Vision APIs."
