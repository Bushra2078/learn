In this module, you learned about the types of Azure Data Science Virtual Machines and when to use each type. The two basic DSVM types are Windows-based and Linux-based which each support different needs. A special version of a Windows-based DSVM is the Geo AI image that supports geospatial AI with the commercial software ArcGIS Pro. For Deep Learning, you can use the Windows or Linux Ubuntu DSVM. A DSVM specifically configured for Deep Learning is available on either Windows 2016 or Linux Ubuntu that feature high-speed computational Graphical Processor Units (GPUs).
