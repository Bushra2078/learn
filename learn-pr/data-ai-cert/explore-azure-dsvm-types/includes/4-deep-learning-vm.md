Deep learning VMs use graphics processing units (GPU) based hardware that provide increased mathematical calculation speed for faster model training. Windows and Ubuntu version support this variation of Azure DSVM. To understand why you would choose a Deep Learning Virtual Machine, we need to discuss the difference between machine learning and deep learning. Then we will look at what the Deep Learning Virtual Machine offers.

## Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning

These two terms are used frequently in the world of data science, so let's define them to get a better understanding of when DLVMs are useful.

**Machine learning** is the process of using algorithms to learn from data and make decisions based on that data. After the algorithm has made a prediction, a data scientist looks at the predictions and determines their accuracy and how to move forward with the results.

**Deep learning** is encompassed in machine learning because it also uses algorithms in the same way, but instead of the need for intervention, the algorithm decides what to do with the results and if they're accurate. In order to make the final decision, deep learning uses a method called artificial neural networks, which is a process that simulates the decision process of the human brain's neural network.

## When to Use Deep Learning Virtual Machines

Creating a neural network can be difficult because there are many different tools that a data scientist could use to complete that task, which can be intimidating. The Deep Learning Virtual Machine simplifies that process by including pre-configured tools for different situations.

## Key Features

- All tools included in a Linux-Based DSVM
- Deep learning tools
- GPU-based Virtual Machine 
- Catalog of tools and samples
- Samples of different deep learning scenarios

## Summary

Although deep learning falls under the umbrella of machine learning, deep learning requires a specific set of tools to build advanced neural networks. The Deep Learning Virtual Machine is a powerful tool that aids in the deep learning process by providing the necessary technology pre-installed and pre-configured for convenience.
