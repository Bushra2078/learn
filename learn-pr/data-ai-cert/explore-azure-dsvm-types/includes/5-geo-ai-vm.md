The Geo AI DSVM is a version of the Windows 2016 DSVM specially configured to support geospatial artificial intelligence and is offered through the collaboration between Esri and Microsoft. Geospatial artificial intelligence refers to the incorporation of machine learning in mapping, map interpretation, or any machine learning with geographical content.

ArcGIS Pro is Esri's next-generation 64-bit desktop geographic information system (GIS). Technologically ahead of everything else on the market, ArcGIS Pro provides professional 2D and 3D mapping in an intuitive user interface. ArcGIS Pro is a big step forward in advancing visualization, analytics, image processing, data management, and integration.

The Geo AI Data Science VM augments the Microsoft DSVM with the rich geospatial capabilities of Esri's ArcGIS Pro. Python and R interfaces to ArcGIS Pro are pre-configured on the Geo AI Data Science VM enabling programmatic access to geospatial analytics within your AI applications. Sample Jupyter notebooks are provided to help you start building AI applications infused with geospatial intelligence.

## Tools Included

The Geo AI DSVM offers a large set of tools for machine learning that are also offered in other versions of Data Science Virtual Machine. Below you are the data science tools included in Geo AI DSVM. Note that the tools need to be compatible with GPUs.

Some of the Deep learning tools include:
- Deep-learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Torch, Chainer
- TensorFlow
- Keras
