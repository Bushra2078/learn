A **data lake** is a repository of data stored in its natural format, usually as blobs or files. **Azure Data Lake Storage** is a comprehensive, highly scalable, and cost-effective data lake solution for big data analytics built in Azure. 

Azure Data Lake Storage combines the power of a high-performance file system, with a massive storage platform to help you quickly identify insights in your data. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 builds on Azure Blob Storage capabilities to optimize it specifically for analytics workloads. As it's integrated with Azure Blob Storage, it enables best in class analytics performance, along with Blob Storage's tiering and data lifecycle management capabilities and the high-availability, security, and durability capabilities of Azure Storage.

The variety and volume of data generated and analyzed today is increasing. Companies have multiple sources of data - from websites to Point of Sale (POS) systems, and more recently social media sites to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Each source provides an essential aspect of data that needs to be collected, analyzed, and potentially acted upon.

## Benefits

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is designed to deal with this variety and volume of data at Exabyte scale while handling hundreds of gigabytes of throughput that is secure by design. Thus, giving you the flexibility to use Data Lake Storage Gen2 as the basis for both real-time and batch solutions. Here is a list of additional benefits that Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 brings:

### Hadoop compatible access

A key benefit of Data Lake Storage Gen2 is that you can treat the data as if it's stored in a Hadoop Distributed File System. This feature enables you to store the data in one place and access it through a wide range of compute technologies including Azure Databricks, HDInsight, and SQL Data Warehouse without moving the data between environments, enabling efficient usage while minimizing the cost.

### Security 

Data Lake Storage Gen2 supports Access Control Lists (ACL) and POSIX permissions. You can set a granular level of permissions at a directory or file level for the data stored within the Data Lake. This security is configurable through a variety of technologies including Hive and Spark, or utilities such as Azure Storage Explorer. Furthermore, all data stored is encrypted at rest using either Microsoft or customer-managed keys.

### Performance

Azure Data Lake Storage organizes the stored data into a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories much like a file system allowing for easier navigation. As a result, data processing requires less computational resources, which in turn reduces both the time and cost.

### Data redundancy

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 takes advantage of the Azure Blob replication models that provide data redundancy in a single data center with Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), or to a secondary region using the Geo-redundant storage option. This feature ensures your data is always available and protected if catastrophe strikes.
