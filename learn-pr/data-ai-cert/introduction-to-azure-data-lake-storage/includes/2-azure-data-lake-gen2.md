A data lake is a repository of data that is stored in its natural format, usually as blobs or files. Azure Data Lake Storage is a comprehensive, scalable, and cost-effective data lake solution for big data analytics built into Azure.

Azure Data Lake Storage combines a file system with a storage platform to help you quickly identify insights into your data. Data Lake Storage Gen2 builds on Azure Blob storage capabilities to optimize it specifically for analytics workloads. This integration combines the tiering and data lifecycle management capabilities of Blob storage, with the high-availability, security, and durability of Azure Storage.

The variety and volume of data that is generated and analyzed today is increasing. Companies have multiple sources of data, from websites to Point of Sale (POS) systems, and more recently from social media sites to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Each source provides an essential aspect of data that needs to be collected, analyzed, and potentially acted upon.

## Benefits

Data Lake Storage Gen2 is designed to deal with this variety and volume of data at exabyte scale while securely handling hundreds of gigabytes of throughput. Making it possible to use Data Lake Storage Gen2 as the basis for both real-time and batch solutions. Here's a list of other benefits that Data Lake Storage Gen2 brings:

### Hadoop compatible access

A benefit of Data Lake Storage Gen2 is that you can treat the data as if it's stored in a Hadoop Distributed File System. With this feature, you can store the data in one place and access it through compute technologies including Azure Databricks, Azure HDInsight, and Azure Synapse Analytics without moving the data between environments.

### Security

Data Lake Storage Gen2 supports access control lists (ACLs) and Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) permissions. You can set permissions at a directory level or file level for the data stored within the data lake. This security is configurable through technologies such as Hive and Spark, or utilities such as Azure Storage Explorer. All data that is stored is encrypted at rest by using either Microsoft or customer-managed keys.

### Performance

Azure Data Lake Storage organizes the stored data into a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories, much like a file system, for easier navigation. As a result, data processing requires less computational resources, reducing both the time and cost.

### Data redundancy

Data Lake Storage Gen2 takes advantage of the Azure Blob replication models that provide data redundancy in a single data center with locally redundant storage (LRS), or to a secondary region by using the Geo-redundant storage (GRS) option. This feature ensures that your data is always available and protected if catastrophe strikes.
