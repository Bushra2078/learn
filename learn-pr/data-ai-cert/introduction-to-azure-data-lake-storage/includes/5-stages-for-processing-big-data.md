Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 plays a fundamental role in a wide range of big data architectures. These architectures can involve the creation of a:

- Modern data warehouse.
- Advanced analytics against big data.
- A real-time analytical solution.

Regardless of the architecture created, there are four stages for processing big data solutions that are common to all.

1. **Ingestion** - The ingestion phase identifies the technology and processes used to acquire the source data. This data can come from files, logs, and other types of unstructured data that must be put into the Data Lake Store. The technology used will vary depending on the frequency the data is transferred. For example: for batch movement of data, Azure Data Factory may be the most appropriate technology to use. For real-time ingestion of data, Apache Kafka for HDInsight or Stream Analytics may be an appropriate technology to use.

1. **Store** - The store phase identifies where the ingested data should be placed. In this case, we're using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2.

1. **Prep & Train** - The Prep and train step identifies the technologies that are used to perform data preparation and model training and scoring for data science solutions. The common technologies used in this phase are Azure Databricks or Machine Learning Services.

1. **Model & Serve** - Finally, the model and serve step involves the technologies that will present the data to users. These can include visualization tools such as Power BI, or other data stores such as SQL Data Warehouse, Cosmos DB, Azure SQL, or Azure Analysis Services. Often, a combination of these technologies will be used depending on the business requirements.
