Training a machine learning model can be as easy as loading data and running one line of code using packages like scikit-learn. However, in a production machine learning scenario, you need to consider:

- Creating reusable training scripts for multiple compute environments.
- Logging model performance metrics during training and evaluation processes.
- Tracking model versions.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Use an *Estimator* to run a model training script as an Azure Machine Learning experiment.
- Create reusable, parameterized training scripts.
- Register models, including metadata such as performance metrics.
