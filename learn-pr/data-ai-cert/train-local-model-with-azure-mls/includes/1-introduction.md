Training a machine learning model can be as easy as loading the data and running one line of Python code from packages like Scikit-Learn, but most of the time the process requires more work.

In this module, you'll use the MNIST dataset as an example to explore the Azure Machine Learning service. You can build and train your model both locally or with remote containers. You train a simple logistic regression model and a series of kNN models to find the one with the highest accuracy. The example we'll use here is an image classification problem in which you want to determine the number contained in an image.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Create a simple logistic model to recognize numbers contained in images from the MNIST dataset
- Create an Azure Machine Learning experiment
- Train a model using the Azure Machine Learning service
- Learn about hyperparameters and what they are used for
- Learn where you can get more resources on using HyperDrive
- Submit the model, monitor the run, and retrieve the results
