  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You have written a script that uses the Scikit-Learn framework to train a model. Which framework-specific estimator should you use to run the script as an experiment?"
    choices: 
    - content: "PyTorch"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To run a scikit-learn training script as an experiment, use the generic Estimator estimator or a SKLearn estimator."
    - content: "Tensorflow"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To run a scikit-learn training script as an experiment, use the generic Estimator estimator or a SKLearn estimator."
    - content: "SKLearn"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To run a scikit-learn training script as an experiment, use the generic Estimator estimator or a SKLearn estimator."
  
  - content: "You have run an experiment to train a model. You want the model to be stored in the workspace, and available to other experiments and published services. What should you do?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Register the model in the workspace."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To store a model in the workspace, register it."
    - content: "Save the model as a file in a Compute Instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To store a model in the workspace, register it."
    - content: "Save the experiment script as a notebook."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To store a model in the workspace, register it."
