  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "An Experiment contains which of the following?"
    choices: 
    - content: "A composition of a series of runs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure ML Studio provides a visual drag and drop machine learning development portal but that is a separate offering."
    - content: "A Docker image"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An Experiment does not contain a Docker image."
    - content: "The data used for model training"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An Experiment does not contain the data for model training."
  
  - content: "A run refers to which of the following?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Python code for a specific task such as training a model or tuning hyperparameters. Run does the job of logging metrics and uploading the results to Azure platform."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Spark is not a part of the service."
    - content: "A set of containers managed by Kubernetes to run your models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A run is not containers managed by Kubernetes."
    - content: "A Spark cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A run is not a Spark cluster."
  
  - content: "A hyperparameter is which of the following?"
    choices: 
    - content: "A model parameter that cannot be learned by the model training process."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Hyperparameters control how the model training executes and must be set before model training."
    - content: "A model feature derived from the source data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hyperparameters cannot be determined from the source data."
    - content: "A parameter that automatically and frequently changes value during a single model training run."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Hyperparameter is set before each model training execution."
