Data warehouse security involves hardening of the data warehouse and its related assets to protect privacy, integrity, and availability of the warehouse assets.

You have set up an Azure SQL Data Warehouse for Contoso; they now require that access to the server is secured, and that access to the database data is controlled. You will set up the authentication mechanism at the server level and provide further security by configuring the server file wall. Once completed, you will control which Contoso employees can access the server by creating logins.

You will then provide more granular access at the database level by creating a database user and controlling the level of access to data by using column and row level security.
