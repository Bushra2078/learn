In this lesson, we learned about some of the security controls Azure SQL Data Warehouse exposes to secure your data warehouse infrastructure and the data that is stored in it. Specifically, we walked through how to enable security by firewall rules, authentication, and authorization. We also looked at how to protect the data in the data warehouse using transparent encryption that Azure SQL Data Warehouse provides. Finally, we looked at how to enable security monitoring for your data warehouse and how to enable an audit trail of database activity.
