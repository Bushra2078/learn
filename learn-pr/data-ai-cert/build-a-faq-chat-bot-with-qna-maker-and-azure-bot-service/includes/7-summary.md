In this module you have achieved quite a bit. QnA Maker can provide an easy solution to creating a service that will provide answers to common questions by making use of existing documents or FAQs.  Integrating the QnA Maker service with a chat bot can also make it easier for users to interact with the FAQs in a conversational manner rather than searching through long documents in a browser interface.
