A Bot is an autonomous program that interacts with people or computer systems in a predictable fashion. The logic behind the Bot is designed and programmed by the Bot creator - often with the help of tools such as the Microsoft Bot framework. Microsoft also has other AI services included in the Azure Cognitive Services that can enhance the capabilities of your Bots.

QnA Maker is one of those AI services to help a Bot answer your users' natural language questions by matching it with the best possible answer from your knowledge base.
