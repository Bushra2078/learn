Azure Data Bricks is a serverless platform optimized for Microsoft Azure which provides one-click setup, streamlined workflows and an interactive workspace for Spark-based applications.  Azure Databricks adds additional capabilities to Apache Spark including fully managed Spark clusters and an interactive workspace.  Clusters are programmable by using REST APIs.  Azure Data Bricks notebooks support familiar programming tools such as R, Python, Scala, or SQL.  Azure Active Directory and Azure Databricks role-based security provide enterprise-grade security.

## Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud integration service that orchestrates that movement of data between various data stores.  Data Engineers can create data-driven workflows in the cloud for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation. Using Azure Data Factory, you can create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that can ingest data from disparate data stores.

It can process and transform the data by using compute services such as Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Spark, Azure Data Lake Analytics, and Azure Machine Learning. Additionally, you can publish output data to data stores such as Azure SQL Data Warehouse for business intelligence (BI) applications to consume. Ultimately, through Azure Data Factory, raw data can be organized into meaningful data stores and data lakes for better business decisions.

## Azure Data Catalog

With Data Catalog, any user (analyst, data scientist, or developer) can discover, understand, and consume data sources. Data Catalog includes a crowdsourcing model of metadata and annotations. It is a single, central place for all of an organization's users to contribute their knowledge and build a community and culture of data sources that are owned by an organization.

It is a fully managed cloud service. Users can discover the data sources they need and understand the data sources they find, and use Data Catalog to help organizations document the information about their data sources.
