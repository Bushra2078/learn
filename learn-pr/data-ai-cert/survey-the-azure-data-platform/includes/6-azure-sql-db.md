Azure SQL Database is a managed relational database service in Azure that supports structures such as relational data, and unstructured formats such as spatial, and XML data. It provides Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) that can scale on demand while employing the comprehensive security and availability features that database services on Azure have.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This unit is focused on **Azure SQL Database**, the _Platform as a Service_ (PaaS) database offering. This unit doesn't cover Microsoft SQL Server installed locally or within an Azure virtual machine (VM). While similar in nature, the setup, configuration, and benefits of Microsoft SQL Server are different from Azure SQL Database.

## When to Use It

Use Azure SQL DB when the scale up and scale down of OLTP systems needs to be performed on demand, and an organization wishes to take advantage of the security and availability features without the risk of investment in capital expenditure, and the inevitable increase in operational spending to invest in these complex on-premises system counterparts.

Azure SQL DB can prove to be a more flexible platform choice than on-premises SQL Server solution as the provisioning and configuration can be performed in minutes and backed up by the Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA).

## Key Features

Azure SQL Database delivers predictable performance with multiple resource types, service tiers, and compute sizes that provides dynamic scalability with no downtime, built-in intelligent optimization, global scalability and availability, and advanced security options â€” all with near-zero administration. These capabilities allow you to focus on rapid app development and accelerating your time to market, rather than allocating precious time and resources to managing virtual machines and infrastructure.

## Ingesting and Processing Data

Azure SQL Database can ingest data through application integration from a wide range of developer Software Development Kits (SDKs) such as .NET, Python, Java, and Node.js. Beyond applications ingestion of data can be performed through Transact-SQL techniques and from the movement of data using Azure Data Factory.

## Querying Data

Data Engineers can use Transact-SQL (T-SQL) to query the contents of a SQL Database, taking advantage of a wide range of standard SQL features to filter, order, and project the data into whatever form required.

## Securing Data

Azure SQL Database provides a range of built-in security and compliance features to help your application meet various security and compliance requirements including:

- Advance Threat Protection
- SQL Database Auditing
- Data Encryption
- Azure Active Directory authentication
- Multi-factor Authentication
- Compliance certification
