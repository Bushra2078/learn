You've accomplished quite a bit in this module. You used an imported dataset to create an experiment. Then you built the experiment logic in the designer and published the experiment as a web service.

By following the steps in this module, you've experienced the core tasks of Azure Machine Learning Studio:

- Ingest data
- Create an experiment
- Train the model
- Test and deploy

You completed all of these tasks and created your first experiment in Machine Learning Studio. You'll use similar workflows in your own AI solutions as you progress to more complex data science and machine learning models and algorithms. Use built-in Microsoft AI services or create custom models when the built-in services don't offer what you need. 

If you want to take a deeper dive into data science, look to the Azure Data Scientist learning paths on Microsoft Learn.
