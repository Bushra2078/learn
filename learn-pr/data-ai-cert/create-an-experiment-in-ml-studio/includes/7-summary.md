You've accomplished quite a bit in this module.  You were created an experiment with an imported dataset and then built the experiment logic in the designer and published it as a web service.

The core parts of using Microsoft Azure ML are:

- ingest data
- create an experiment
- train the model
- test and deploy

You have achieved all of these steps in this module and created your first experiment in Azure Machine Learning Studio. You will use similar workflows as you progress to more complex data science and machine learning models and algorithms to use artificial intelligence in your own solutions.

Recall, you can use Microsoft's built-in AI services or create custom models, when the built-in services don't offer what you need. Data science is a deeper subject so if you are interested, look to the Azure Data Scientist learning paths on Microsoft Learn.
