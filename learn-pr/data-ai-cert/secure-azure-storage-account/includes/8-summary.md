Azure Storage provides a layered security model. This model enables you to secure your storage accounts to a specific set of supported networks. When network rules are configured, only applications requesting data from over the specified set of networks can access a storage account. Authorization is supported with Azure Active Directory (AD) credentials (for blobs and queues) (preview), a valid account access key, or a SAS token. Encryption of the data is enabled by default, and you can perform proactive monitoring with Advanced Threat Detection.
