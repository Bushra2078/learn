Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 provides a first-class data lake solution for enterprises to pull together their data. It's built on top of Azure Blob storage and inherits all the security features we've seen in this module. Along with Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 provides **POSIX-compliant Access Control Lists (ACLs)** that restrict access to only authorized users, groups, or service principals in a flexible, fine-grained, and manageable manner. Authentication is via Azure Active Directory OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, which allows for flexible authentication schemes including federation with **AAD Connect** and multi-factor authentication for stronger protection than just passwords.

More significantly, these authentication schemes are integrated into the main analytics services that utilize the data including Azure Databricks, HDInsight, and SQL Data Warehouse as well as management tools such as Azure Storage Explorer. Once authenticated, permissions are applied at the finest granularity to ensure the right level of authorization for protecting an enterprise's big data assets.

The Azure Storage end-to-end encryption of data and transport layer protections complete the security shield for an enterprise data lake. The same set of analytics engines and tools can take advantage of these additional layers of protection, resulting in a complete end to end protection of your analytics pipelines.
