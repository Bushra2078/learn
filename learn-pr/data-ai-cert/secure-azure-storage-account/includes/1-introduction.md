Azure Storage accounts provide a wealth of security options that protect your cloud-based data. Because many services such as Blob storage, File shares, Table storage, and Azure Data Lake Storage all build on top of Azure Storage, they all benefit from the find-grained security controls provided.

Imagine that the network administrator at Contoso is performing a security audit of the assets within the domain. When it comes to cloud-based data, it's essential that she's satisfied that all the data stored in Azure follows the corporate policy of defense in depth. As their primary data consultant, your job is to take her through the available options in Azure Storage to ensure the security requirements meet the needs of the organization.
