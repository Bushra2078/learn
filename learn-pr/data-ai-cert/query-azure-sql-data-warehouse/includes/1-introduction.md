In this module, you are going to learn the most fundamental operation to the Azure SQL Data  Warehouse (ASDW) â€“ querying the database. You are going to focus on how to read the data from a sample database with the SELECT statement and its clauses.

After being convinced that ASDW can solve the issue of loading the business intelligence solution promptly, report writers within Contoso are nervous and are asking you as the data engineer to ease their concerns at writing reports against a cloud database. You intend to show the report writers that they can continue to use Transact SQL statements with the standard clauses including `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. As you know that the major difference in their work is changing a connection string, you will create a new ASDW server with a sample database to highlight the connection information with clarity.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Create an Azure SQL Data Warehouse sample database.
- Query the sample database with the SELECT statement and its clauses.
- Use the queries in different client applications such as SQL Server Management Studio, and PowerBI
