Deployment takes a few minutes while Azure:

- Provisions a server in a data center.
- Creates a new database.
- Loads the AdventureWorks data into the database.

Select the **Notification** icon on the toolbar to see the progress of the creation. After it deploys, you get a popup notification. Use it to go to the new resource or pin the resource to your dashboard.

Select **Go to resource** to open the **Overview** page for your new database.

## View the new database details

Explore the database details on the **Overview** page. To get to this page, use the global search feature or your Azure dashboard.

Here, you can see the traffic that's processing. You also can access various features and configuration options and do common tasks, such as backup or restore on the database.

As an example, the **Server name** and **Connection strings** are two useful items of information you can access on this view.
