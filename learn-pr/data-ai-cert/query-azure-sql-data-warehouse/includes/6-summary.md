In this module, you have explored how to create a sample database with Azure SQL Data Warehouse and how to connect to it using SQL Server Management Studio. We then explored simple queries that can be issued against the Data Warehouse and examined how the data can be visualized in both Excel and Power BI.

## Cleanup

To avoid additional costs in your Azure account, make sure to delete the **mslearn-demodw** resource group. This will remove all of the resources we created in this module. Here's the steps you need to do.

1. Find the **mslearn-demodw** resource group - an easy way to locate it is to select **Resource groups** in the Azure sidebar.

1. Select the resource group and either right-click on the row, or use the "..." button on the far-right side of the row to open the context menu.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.
