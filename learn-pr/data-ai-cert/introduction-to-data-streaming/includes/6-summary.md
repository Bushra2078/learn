Azure Stream Analytics is a PaaS service that integrates with your applications and Internet of Things (IoT) to gain insights with streaming data or static data held in a blob store. The process of consuming data streams, analyzing them, and deriving actionable insights out of them is called event processing. It requires an event producer, an event processor, and an event consumer. Azure Stream Analytics provides the event processing aspect to streaming that's fully managed and highly reliable.

In this module, you learned how real-time analytics of streaming data works, in principle. You also discovered how you can use Azure Stream Analytics to integrate streaming data into your real-time analytics workflows.
