Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics is an event processing engine. It enables the consumption and analysis of high volumes of streaming data generated by sensors, devices, or applications and processes the data in real time. A typical event processing pipeline built on top of Stream Analytics consists of four components: An event producer, an event ingestion system, the stream analytics engine, and finally the consumer.

- An event producer is any application, system, or sensor that continuously produces event data of interest. Examples can include a sensor that tracks the flow of water in a utility pipe to an application such a Twitter that generates tweets against a single hashtag.
- An event ingestion system takes the data from the source system or application to pass onto an analytics engine. Azure Event Hub, Azure IoT Hub, or Azure Blobs can all serve as the ingestion system.
- The stream analytics engine is where compute is run over the incoming streams of data and insights extracted. Azure Stream Analytics exposes Stream Analytics Query Language (SAQL), a subset of Transact-SQL tailored to perform computations over streaming data. The engine supports Windowing functions that are fundamental to stream processing and are implemented using SAQL.
- An event consumer is a destination of the output from stream analytics engine. The target can be storage (Azure Data Lake, Cosmos DB, SQL Azure, or Azure blob store) or dashboards powered by Power BI.

## Operational aspects

Stream Analytics guarantees **exactly-once** event processing and **at-least-once** event delivery, so events are never lost. It has built-in recovery capabilities in case the delivery of an event fails. Also, Stream Analytics provides built-in checkpointing to maintain the state of your job and produces repeatable results.

Because Azure Stream Analytics is a PaaS service, it is fully managed and highly reliable. With built-in integration with various sources and destinations coupled with a flexible programmability model, it enhances programmer productivity. Furthermore, since the Stream Analytics engine enables in-memory compute, it offers superior performance. All these factors contribute to low total cost of ownership (TCO) of Azure Stream Analytics.
