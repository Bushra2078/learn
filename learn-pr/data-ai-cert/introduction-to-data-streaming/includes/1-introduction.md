Today, massive amounts of real-time data are generated by connected applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors, and various other sources. The proliferation of these streaming data sources has made the ability to consume and make informed decisions from these data in near-real-time an operational necessity for many organizations.

To provide a few examples, online stores analyze real-time clickstream data to provide product recommendations to consumers as they browse the website. Manufacturing facilities utilize telemetry data from IoT sensors to remotely monitor high-value assets. And credit card transactions from point-of-sale systems are scrutinized in real-time to detect and prevent potentially fraudulent activities.
