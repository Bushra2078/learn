  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You've uploaded some data files to a folder in a blob container, and registered the blob container as a datastore in your Azure Machine Learning workspace. You want to run a script as an experiment that loads the data files and trains a model. What should you do?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Save the experiment script in the same blob folder as the data files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To access a path in a datastore in an experiment script, you must create a data reference and pass it to the script as a parameter. The script can then read data from the data reference parameter just like a local file path."
    - content: "Create a data reference for the datastore location and pass it to the script as a parameter."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To access a path in a datastore in an experiment script, you must create a data reference and pass it to the script as a parameter. The script can then read data from the data reference parameter just like a local file path."
    - content: "Create global variables for the Azure Storage account name and key in the experiment script."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To access a path in a datastore in an experiment script, you must create a data reference and pass it to the script as a parameter. The script can then read data from the data reference parameter just like a local file path."
  
  - content: "You've registered a dataset in your workspace. You want to use the dataset in an experiment script that is run using an estimator. What should you do?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Pass the dataset as a named input to the estimator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To access a dataset in an experiment script, pass the dataset as a named input to the estimator."
    - content: "Create a data reference for the datastore location where the dataset data is stored, and pass it to the script as a parameter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To access a dataset in an experiment script, pass the dataset as a named input to the estimator."
    - content: "Use the dataset to save the data as a CSV file in the experiment script folder before running the experiment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To access a dataset in an experiment script, pass the dataset as a named input to the estimator."
