The Windows DSVM provides a wide selection of languages, development tools, machine learning tools, data visualization tool, and data platforms that enable you to accomplish most of data science tasks. Here are some examples of those tasks:

- To find, load and preprocess data

    Use the pre-installed data platform & ingestion tools, such as Azure blob storage, Azure Data Lake, Azure HDInsight (Hadoop), Azure CosmosDB, Azure SQL Data Warehouse & databases.
- To train and test models

    Use Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code as development tools, select your preferred language (R or Python), leverage the powerful tools included in the Microsoft ML Server (for example, Microsoft R Server as we demonstrated in the earlier section)

- To operationalize the mode

    Use R and Python Azure Machine Learning to deploy your model so client applications can access your models using a simple web service interface

- To train deep learning models

    Use deep learning platforms such as PyTorch, CNKT, TensorFlow that supports GPU computation to accelerate the model training.
- To visualize data

    Use the Power BI Desktop to build reports and dashboards and one-click to publish to the cloud
- Share file and code

    Create an Azure File storage as a mountable drive on your DSVM to share large-scale datasets/code with your team; use Git clients â€“ Git Bash and Git GUI to access your repository and share code with your team
- Cloud administration

    Use the Azure portal or PowerShell to manage your Azure resources, such as to restart/stop your VM, dynamically scale your DSVM to meet your project needs, extend your storage space, etc.

## Learn with pre-loaded Jupyter Notebooks

The DSVM has some pre-loaded notebooks for learning purposes. The pre-loaded notebooks are designed to teach about how to use various Azure services, such as the Azure Machine Learning services, SQL Server/Machine Learning Server, and Cognitive Services. To access the notebooks, launch the Jupyter Notebook and go into the notebooks folder. Subject areas are in separate subfolders. Note:  SQL Server Developer Edition is installed with Machine Learning Server and data and code is loaded into the local database instance.

You can browse the [DSVM samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-samples-and-walkthroughs) for a more comprehensive understanding of what learning resources are available, and can also refer the notebooks by the language you prefer.
