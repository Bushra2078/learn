Use the following steps in the Azure portal.

1. In your job, select **Overview** in the menu to get back to the main overview page.
1. Select **Start** from the menu bar across the top of the overview page.

1. Select **Start**.

The job should transition to the "Starting" and then after a few seconds, the "Running" state. It will run for a few minutes and then finish in the "Completed" state. You should be able to watch this transition on the **Overview** page for your job.
