Jobs are the foundation of performing real-time analytics in Azure Stream Analytics, and the good news is that it's straightforward to set them up. You'll set the job inputs to ingest the data, define how the data is to be processed and configure a job output to store or display the results.

Let's say that you're demonstrating to the Contoso team how to set up Azure Stream Analytics. You first provide a high level of the workflow before showing the team how to create a job. Once completed you'll show them how to create a job input followed by a job output. Finally, you'll provide example queries that can be used to perform the analytics before showing the team how to start the job and verify the result.
