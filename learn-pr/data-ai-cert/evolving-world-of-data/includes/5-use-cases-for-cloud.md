Microsoft Azure can work for a range of industries including:

## Web

Using Azure Cosmos DB's multi-master replication model along with Microsoft's performance commitments, Data Engineers can implement a data architecture to support web and mobile applications that achieve less than a 10-ms response time anywhere in the world.  This can increase customer satisfaction by reducing the processing time of web sites for global organizations.

## Healthcare

Azure Databricks can be used to accelerate big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Within the healthcare industry, it can be used to perform genome studies or pharmacy sales forecasting at petabyte scale, while using the inherent features of Azure Databricks to set up your Spark environment in minutes and auto scale quickly and easily.

Data Engineers can collaborate with Data Scientist through shared projects and workspaces in a wide range of languages including SQL, R, Scala, and Python. Native integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and other Azure services enables you to build a range of solution types including a modern data warehouse, machine learning and real-time analytics solutions.

## IoT scenarios

Over the last couple of years, hundreds of thousands of devices have been designed and sold to generate sensor data known as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Using technologies like Azure IoT Hub, Data Engineers can easily design a data solution architecture that captures information from IoT devices to be analyzed further.
