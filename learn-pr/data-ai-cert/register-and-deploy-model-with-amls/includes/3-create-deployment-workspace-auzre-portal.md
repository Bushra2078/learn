The Azure Machine Learning Workspace is the foundational block in the cloud for your machine learning tasks. You can use it to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models. The easiest way to create a deployment workspace is through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). You can sign into  the Azure portal by using the credentials for the Azure subscription you use.
