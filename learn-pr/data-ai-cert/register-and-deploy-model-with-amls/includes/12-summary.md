In this module, you learned how to register and deploy a model at scale using the Azure Machine Learning service. You created a deployment workspace in the portal and your python script. You registered the model to the container registry and created a model scoring script used to define the call parameters needed by the REST API. Then you created a container image that defines the requirements of the deployment container and deployed your model to the container. Finally, you scored new data using the deployed container.
