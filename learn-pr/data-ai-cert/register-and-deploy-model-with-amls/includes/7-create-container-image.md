You need to register the trained model which the code below will do.

```python
# register model
model = run.register_model(model_name='sklearn_mnist_model.pkl',
                           model_path='outputs/sklearn_mnist_model.pkl')

print(model.name, model.id, model.version, sep='\t')
```

The third step is preparing the container image. The following Python code uses the Azure ML SDK to create the image.

```python
from azureml.core.image import Image, ContainerImage

image_config = ContainerImage.image_configuration(runtime= "python",
                                 execution_script="score.py",
                                 conda_file="myenv.yml",
                                 tags = {'data': "MNIST", 'type': "sklearn"},
                                 description = "Image for sklearn model")

image = Image.create(name = "myimage1",
                     # this is the model object 
                     models = [model],
                     image_config = image_config, 
                     workspace = ws)

image.wait_for_creation(show_output = True)

print('Done')
```

After the code is executed, you can view the images in the Azure Machine Learning service portal:

In the next unit, you explore how to monitor the deployed models and collect metrics for the models.
