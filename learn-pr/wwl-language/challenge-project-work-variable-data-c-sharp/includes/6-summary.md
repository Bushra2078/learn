Your challenge was to update an application to support multiple term search and to improve the "search status" information animation.

In this module, you developed code that combines:

- Iteration statements using data input
- Data processing
- Formatting data output
- Choosing the correct data types and safely converting data types
- Creating and manipulating string arrays, and sorting array data
- Modifying and building complex strings from multiple data sources, and formatting data for display

You delivered functionality to your Contoso pet app team, including:

- Gather the pet characteristics for multiple search term inputs
- Store search input terms in a sorted array
- Display the dogs that have a term match
- Provide an improved search status animation with a countdown
