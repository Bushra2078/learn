You updated the pet adoption application in this guided project to support single term search functionality, improve readability of output, and add a suggested donation to descriptions.

In this module, you practiced your ability to:

- Apply iteration statements to gather data input
- Use data processing
- Format data output
- Choose the correct data types and safely converting data types
- Manipulate number, string and character arrays, as well as add, remove, and sort data
- Modify and build complex strings from multiple data sources, and format data for display across regions

You delivered functionality to your Contos pet app team, including:

- Gather the pet characteristic search term input
- Loop through the animals array and identify "dogs"
- For each dog, search the description for a term match
- Display the dogs that have a term match
- Provide suggested donation data formatted in local currency
