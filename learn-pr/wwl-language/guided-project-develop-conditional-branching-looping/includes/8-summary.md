Our goal was to build an application that implements a combination of selection and iteration statements to achieve the design goals of our application.

By creating nested combinations of iteration and selection statements, we built a user interface that enables the user to display pet data from the ourAnimals array, as well as enter characteristics of new pets that we validate and add to the ourAnimals array. The app user can continue making menu selections until they choose to exit the application.

Having the ability to implement a variety of iteration and selection statements enables you to optimize your code.
