Your goal was to build an application that takes course information for a student, calculates the overall GPA, and displays the results.

To accomplish this, you declared and assigned values to variables of different data types, performed numeric operations, and used type casting to achieve accurate results. You also used the WriteLine() method and character escape sequences to format the output.
