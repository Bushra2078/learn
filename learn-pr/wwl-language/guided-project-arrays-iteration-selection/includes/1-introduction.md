The ability to branch code execution and iterate a code block are essential capabilities for a developer. In C#, you can use an `if` statement to choose between different code blocks based the evaluation of an expression. In addition, you can use a `foreach` statement to loop through each element in an array. When you combine the ability to iterate through an array with the ability to branch the execution path, you are able to create powerful and extensible code.

Suppose you're a teacher's assistant that's been working on an application to help automate the grading process. Your C# programming skills have increased since you handed off the initial version of your application. The teacher has asked you to make updates to the application. Your updates should focus on using arrays, `foreach` statements, and `if` statements. The teacher also wants you to include extra credit assignments in your calculations of the final grades.  

In this module, you'll be guided through the process of updating your Student Grading application. You'll use arrays to store student names and the scores of graded assignments, and you'll use `foreach` statements to iterate through the array values. You will use the `foreach` code block to calculate each student's final score and letter grade. Your completed application will format the grades using the teacher's updated specification.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to implement arrays, `foreach` statements, and `if` statements to create applications that efficiently process data using nested iteration and branching logic.

> This is a guided project module where youâ€™ll complete an end-to-end project by following step-by-step instructions.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you'll practice how to:

- Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses foreach loops to access array data.
- Use if statements to evaluate conditions and create code branches.

## Prerequisites

- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes.
- Experience using if statements in C# to evaluate an expression and branch code accordingly.
- Experience using a foreach loop to access elements of array variables.
