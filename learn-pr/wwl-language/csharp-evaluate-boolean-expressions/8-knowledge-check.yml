    - content: "`ToLower()`."
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "Which line of code uses logical negation?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(!value);`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Adding the `!` operator (the \"not-operator\") before a conditional expression checks to ensure the expression is false."
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine( value!= true);`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Evaluating whether a value isn't equal to `true` isn't an example of logical negation."
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine( value!= false);`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Evaluating whether a value isn't equal to `false` isn't an example of logical negation."

    choices:
    - content: "`int value = amount >= 10? 10: 20;`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The syntax for a conditional operator is \"? (value 1) : (value 2)\"."
    - content: "`int value = amount >= 10: 10? 20;`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The conditional operator is reversed."
    - content: "`int value = amount >= 10? 10| 20;`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The pipe character isn't a component of the conditional operator syntax."
