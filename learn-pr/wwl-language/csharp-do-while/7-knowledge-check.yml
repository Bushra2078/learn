  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer needs to iterate through an array of items to find one that matches a certain criteria.  Which is the best iteration statement for this purpose?"
    choices:
    - content: "`foreach`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! It's possible to perform this operation using any of these iteration statements, however the `foreach` is the best suited for cases like this process sequences."
    - content: "`for`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to use the `for` statement, but the `foreach` statement was created for working with sequences."
    - content: "`while`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to use the `while` statement, but the `foreach` statement was created for working with sequences."
  - content: "A developer needs to capture a list of items from the user.  The user will enter the keyboard combination `ctrl + Esc` to exit.  Which is the best iteration statement for this purpose?"
    choices:
    - content: "foreach"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's remotely possible to use the `foreach` statement for this purpose, but it wouldn't be straight forward."
    - content: "do-while"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  The `do-while` will allow the code to check each entry by the user until they enter the special keyboard combination to exit."
    - content: "while"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to use the `while` statement, but the `do-while` will allow the user to enter a value before the code begins checking for the special keyboard combination."
