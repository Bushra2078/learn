quiz:
  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the **following** correctly describes a difference between the `do-while` and the `while` iterative statements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Application code exits a `while` statement when an expression evaluates to false."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Both the `do-while` statement and the `while` statement evaluate an expression to determine when to stop iterating."
    - content: "A `while` statement executes a code block at least once."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A `do-while` statement iterates through a code block at least once because the expression is evaluated at the end of the code block. The expression for a `while` statement is evaluated before the code block and therefore the code block may not be executed even once."
    - content: "A `do-while` statement iterates through a code block until a condition is met."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The `do-while` will iterate through a code block at least once."
  - content: "A developer needs to capture user input inside a loop. The user enters the keyboard combination `ctrl + Esc` to exit the iteration when they're done entering information. Which is the best iteration statement for this purpose?"
    choices:
    - content: "while"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to use the `while` statement for this purpose, but the `do-while` loop will require the user to enter information once before checking for the special keyboard combination that exists the iteration."
    - content: "for"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to use the `for` statement, but the `do-while` will allow the code to iterate indefinitely. The `do-while` will iterate until the user enters the special keyboard combination and doesn't require a `break` statement to exit the iteration."
    - content: "do-while"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  The `do-while` will allow the developer to check each entry by the user until they enter the special keyboard combination to exit."
