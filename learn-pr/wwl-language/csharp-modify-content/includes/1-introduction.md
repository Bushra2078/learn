Suppose you are as a developer on an application to enable users of a business to update a "last chance deals" website by sending email to a specific site used by the application. The site update email uses *special* text in title and body to instruct the  automation how to update the website, including what text to extract and post to the website.

Frequently, application data you need to work with from other software systems has data you don't want or need. The data is in a format that is unusable, containing  *extra* information that makes the important information difficult to extract. When this happens, you need tools and techniques to parse through string data, isolate the information you need, and remove the information you don't need.

In this module, you use string helper methods to identify and isolate the information you're interested in. You learn how to copy a smaller portion of a larger string. You replace characters, or remove characters from a string.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to modify a string's contents, isolating specific portions to extract, replace, or remove.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify the position of a character or string inside of another string
- Extract portions of strings
- Remove portions of strings
- Replace values in strings with different values

## Prerequisites

- Beginner level experience with `string` helper methods
