Your goal was to use the `for` statement in our code, modifying how the `for` statement performs its looping logic.

Using the `for` statement, you iterated a hard-coded number of times, and used the `Length` on an array to iterate through the code block once for each item in the array. You modified the iterator, the condition for exiting the loop, and the pattern for iteration. You used the `break` keyword to exit out of the loop's body prematurely.

If you're following this learning path in order, you've now learned about the `foreach` and the `for` iteration statements. Next, you'll use the `while` and `do-while` iteration statements to loop until a condition in the body of the code block is met.
