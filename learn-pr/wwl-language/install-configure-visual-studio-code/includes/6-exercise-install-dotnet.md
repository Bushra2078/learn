.NET is a cross-platform, open-source developer platform that can be used to develop different types of applications. It includes the software languages and code libraries used to develop .NET applications. You can write .NET applications in C#, F#, or Visual Basic.

The .NET runtime is the code library that's required to run your C# applications. You may also see the .NET runtime referred to as the Common Language Runtime, or CLR. The .NET runtime isn't required to *write* your code, but it's required to actually *run* your applications.

## Check to see if .NET is already installed

1. Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code open.

    You can use the Windows Start menu to locate and open Visual Studio Code.

1. On the **Terminal** menu, select **New Terminal**.

    You use the Terminal panel to enter a .NET CLI command.

1. At the Terminal command prompt, type: `dotnet --version` and then press the Enter key.

    This command displays the version number if .NET is installed on your PC.

1. Take a moment to view the response to your `dotnet --version` command.

    If you receive an error message telling you that the term `dotnet` isn't recognized, then you don't have the .NET SDK installed.

    If a version of .NET is installed, you should see a response message listing the version number similar to the following:

    `7.0.201`

1. Close Visual Studio Code.

## Install the .NET 7 Software Development Kit

Having the latest supported version of the .NET platform installed is recommended. Although .NET 6 is also supported, .NET 7 includes improvements that you may find helpful.

> [!NOTE]
> The C# training series that's available on Microsoft Learn uses .NET 7. Ensure that you have .NET 7 installed if you plan on completing this training.

1. Open a new Internet browser window.

1. To open the download page for the .NET SDK, navigate to the following URL:

    [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

1. On the **Download .NET** page, select the *recommended* version of the .NET SDK.

    Your browser downloads the .NET SDK installer file.

1. Run the .NET SDK installer file.

    On a Windows PC, you can find your Downloads folder using File Explorer. Double-click the installation file to begin the installation process.

1. On the .NET SDK Installer window, select **Install**.

1. Wait for the installation to complete.

    Installation should take about less than a minute. Once installation is complete, a message displays confirming the installation was successful.

1. To close the installer window, select **Close**.

## Verify your installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Visual Studio Code checks to see whether .NET is installed when it starts up. If you had Visual Studio Code open when you installed .NET, you will need to close it and then open a new instance to ensure that it recognizes that .NET is installed.

1. On the **Terminal** menu, select **New Terminal**.

1. At the Terminal command prompt, type: `dotnet --version` and then press the Enter key.

1. Ensure that a .NET version number is listed.

    The version number is similar to: `7.0.201`

    You're likely to see a more recent version number. But it should begin with `7.` if you installed the .NET 7 SDK.

Congratulations, you did it! You're now ready to begin coding C# in Visual Studio Code.
