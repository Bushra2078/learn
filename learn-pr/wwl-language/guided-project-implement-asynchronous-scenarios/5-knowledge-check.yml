  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Why do you use a boolean flag to know when a thread has started?"
    choices:
    - content: "A boolean flag provides a simple and efficient way to signal the state of the thread to other parts of the code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A boolean flag provides an efficient way that tells you if a thread is running."
    - content: "A boolean flag is used to pause a thread."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A boolean flag is not used to pause a thread."
    - content: "To enclose code that may throw an exception."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A boolean flag is not used to enclose code that might throw an exeption."
  - content: "What is the difference between I/O bound and compute bound operations in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "I/O bound operations involve waiting for external devices to exchange information, while compute bound operations involve calculations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. I/O bound operations are for waiting for external operations to finish and compute bound operations involve calculations."
    - content: "I/O bound operations involve calculations, while compute bound operations involve waiting for external devices to exchange information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. I/O bound operations are for waiting for external operations to finish and compute bound operations involve calculations."
    - content: "I/O bound operations involve waiting for user input, while compute bound operations involve waiting for external devices to exchange information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. I/O bound operations are for waiting for external operations to finish. Compute bound operations involve calculations."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the `Task.Factory.StartNew` method in the code?"
    choices:
    - content: "It starts a new task that runs the code within a Lambda expression."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `Task.Factory.StartNew` starts a new task that runs within a Lambda expression."
    - content: "It creates a new thread to run the code within the Lambda expression."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `Task.Factory.StartNew` starts a new Task. It doesn't create a new Thread."
    - content: "It starts a new process to run the code within the Lambda expression."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `Task.Factory.StartNew` doesn't start a new process."
