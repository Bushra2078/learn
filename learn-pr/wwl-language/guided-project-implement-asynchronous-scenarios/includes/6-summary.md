As you have seen, you can improve application performance and remove bottlenecks that impede performance by putting the computation-bound and io-bound operations in separate threads. You put them in a new thread by putting the generation of a new ant in a separate Task.

In this module, you have learned how to implement asynchronous programming in C# to create a new Task and prevent the UI from freezing during calculations. Additionally, you have learned how to implement asynchronous IO operations using the `async` and `await` keywords in C# to make file IO operations asynchronous and prevent UI freezes.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Implement asynchronous programming in C# to create a new thread and prevent UI freezes during calculations.
- Implement asynchronous IO operations using the `async` and `await` keywords in C# to make file IO operations asynchronous and prevent UI freezes.
