When we use decision and iteration statements, we rely on code blocks to define units of code that should be skipped, executed, iterated over, and so on. However, these code blocks also impact variable declaration and accessibility. Code blocks are also used in higher-level constructs when we start building real applications.

In this module, you'll define variables inside and outside the boundaries of code blocks. You'll remove code blocks in certain situations to make code more readable. You'll also learn how code is structured in applications using  namespaces, classes, and methods, all of which rely on code blocks. You'll learn how these higher-level code blocks affect the accessibility and visibility of your code, and use accessibility modifiers like `public` to access functionality across code blocks. You'll learn how to instruct the compiler to look in a given namespace when it needs to resolve the name of a class with the `using` statement.

By the end of this module, you'll use code blocks with more confidence, understanding how they impact the visibility and accessibility of both higher and lower-level constructs in your code.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Understand the impact of declaring and initializing variables inside and outside of code blocks.
- Remove code blocks in `if` statements when there's only one line of code in the body of the code block to improve readability.
- Identify namespaces, classes, and methods in your code.
- Understand how moving methods into new classes, and classes into new namespaces impacts the visibility of the code.
- Understand the use of the `using` statement to instruct the compiler where to look for classes referenced in your code.

## Prerequisites:

- Experience declaring and initializing variables
- Experience with the `if-elseif-else` statement
- Experience calling methods of classes in the .NET Class Library
