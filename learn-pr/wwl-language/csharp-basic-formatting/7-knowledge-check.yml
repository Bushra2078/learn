quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following escape sequences would you use to add double quotes to your literal string?"
     choices:
    - content: "\\q"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. \\q isn't a valid escape sequence."
    - content: "\\ '"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. \\ ' is the escape sequence for a single quote, not a double quote."
    - content: "\\\ ""
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code correctly uses string interpolation assuming that the variable `value` is a string?"
    choices:
    - content: "'`Console.WriteLine(@\"My value: {value}\");`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line uses the at `@` symbol instead of the dollar `$` symbol as the prefix for string interpolation."
    - content: "'`Console.WriteLine($\"My value: {value}\");`'"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "'`Console.WriteLine(@\"My value: [value]\");`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line uses the at `@` symbol instead of the dollar `$` symbol, and square brackets instead of curly braces for the interpolation expression."
  - content: "You embedded Unicode characters in your strings to present a special message in Thai. However, the message is only displayed as question mark characters.  What happened?"
    choices:
    - content: "You're missing the \\u escape sequence for Unicode characters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If you don't use the \\u escape sequence for Unicode characters, you won't see question marks.  You see the numbers."
    - content: "You used the wrong Unicode characters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is unlikely.  It would only be true if all the Unicode characters were the same value representing a question mark--\\u003F."
    - content: "The user's console doesn't support Unicode characters."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code append a single `\\` to the string `directory`?"
    choices:
    - content: "'`directory = directory + \"\\\";`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line escapes the `\"` character and results in an error."
    - content: "'`directory = directory + '\\';`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line escapes the `'` character and results in an error."
    - content: "'`directory = directory + @\"\\\";`'"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `@` symbol creates a verbatim string where it is unnecessary to escape the `\\`."
