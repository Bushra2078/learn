Creating a minigame can help you practice your programming skills and improve your ability to create console applications in Python.

In this module, you develop the classic rock, paper, scissors minigame, with the help of GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot. That is, you don't need to worry about configuring the development environment, being able to focus on application development and rely on a code assistant.

## Learn before you code

If you're new to GitHub platforms, we have some resources to help you get started:

- [Introduction to GitHub Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-to-github-copilot/).
- [Introduction To Codespaces](https://aka.ms/CodespacesVideoTutorial).

## About the challenge
The rock, paper, scissors game is a hand game in which each player chooses one of the three tools. From a programming point of view, this challenge is a nice exercise to practice conditional decisions, iterations, and the use of Python modules.

The winner of the game is based in three simple rules:

- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beat paper.
- Paper beats rock.

By the end of this module, you have created a playable mini-game application with GitHub Copilot!

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **_challenge project_** module where you will complete a project end-to-end based on a specification. This module is designed to be a test of your skills: there are few guidelines and no step-by-step instructions.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you demonstrate your ability to:

- Experience GitHub Codespaces as a development environment.
- Develop input and output routines in a Python console application.
- Use GitHub Copilot as an assistant.

## Prerequisites

- Apply iteration statements using data inputs.
- Process data.
- Format data output.
- Basic knowledge of methods in Python.
- A GitHub account.
