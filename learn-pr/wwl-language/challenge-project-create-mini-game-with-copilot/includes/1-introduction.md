Creating a minigame can help you practice your programming skills and improve your ability to create console applications in Python.

In this module, you will develop the classic rock, paper, scissors minigame, with the help of GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot. That is, you won't have to worry about setting up the development environment, and you can focus on developing the application and rely on a code assistant.

## Learn before you code
If this is your first time using the GitHub platforms? No problem! We have a few resources to help you get started.

- [Introduction to GitHub Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-to-github-copilot/).
- [Introduction To Codespaces](https://aka.ms/CodespacesVideoTutorial).

## About the challenge
The rock, paper, scissors game is a hand game in which each player chooses one of the three tools. From a programming point of view, this is a nice exercise to practice conditional decisions, iterations, and the use of Python modules.

The winner of the game is determined by a simple set of rules:
- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beat paper.
- Paper beats rock.

By the end of this module, you'll have created a playable mini-game application!

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **_challenge project_** module where you will complete a project end-to-end based on a specification. This module is designed to be a test of your skills: there are few guidelines and no step-by-step instructions.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will demonstrate your ability to:

- Experience GitHub Codespaces as a development environment.
