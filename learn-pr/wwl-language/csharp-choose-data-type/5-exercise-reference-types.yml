quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "In C#, when you use the `new` keyword to create an instance of a `class`, where is the memory allocated?"
    choices:
    - content: "Stack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Instances of classes are not typically allocated on the stack."
    - content: "Heap"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. Instances of classes are allocated on the heap when created with the `new` keyword."
    - content: "Variable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. The term \"variable\" refers to the identifier used to access stored data, not the location of memory allocation."
