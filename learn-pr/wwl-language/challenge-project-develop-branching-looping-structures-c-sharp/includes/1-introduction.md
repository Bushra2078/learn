When you develop an application, you often begin by developing the features that import or generate the data used by the application. Once your application has access to a dataset that supports the features of your application, or the means to create its own data, you're able to focus on the features that process data and generate reports.  

The features of the Contoso Pets application that are used to create the ourAnimals array data are nearly complete. The only task that remains is to ensure that the ourAnimals array data contains a complete dataset for each pet. A combination of selection and iteration statements will be needed to implement the new app features.

Suppose you are one of the developers working on the Contoso Pets application. The application will be used to help you find new homes for pets that have been abandoned, or for cases when the owner cannot be located. The primary features of the application have been specified, and you and your friends have made good progress on the code that creates the ourAnimals array data used by the app. However, since some information is not available when a pet's data is first entered, you need to build the features that are used to ensure a complete dataset exists for each animal. You have volunteered to develop an initial version of the new features.

This module challenges you to develop features of the Contoso Pets application.

In short, you need to:

- develop the feature that ensures animal ages and physical descriptions are complete
- develop the feature that ensures animal nickname and personality descriptions are complete

By the end of this module, you'll have an updated version of the Contoso Pets application that is able to ensure every pet in the ourAnimals array has a complete dataset.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a challenge project module where you’ll complete an end-to-end project from a specification. This module is intended to be a test of your skills; there’s little guidance and no step-by-step instructions.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you'll demonstrate your ability to:

- Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses a combination of selection and iteration statements to implement logical workflows in accordance with supplied application data and user interactions.
- Evaluate the underlying conditions and make an informed decision when choosing between if-elseif-else and switch statements, and between foreach, for, while, and do iteration statements.
- Scope variables at an appropriate level within an application.

## Prerequisites

- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes
- Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks
- Experience using if-elseif-else and switch-case statements in C# to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes
- Experience using foreach, for, do, and while statements in C# to loop through a block of code and access elements of array variables
