  questions:
  - content: "You are developing an application in Visual Studio Code. You save changes to your Program.cs file, and then run the `dotnet build` command in the Terminal panel. What information can you find in reported Error and Warning messages?"
    choices:
    - content: "one or more suggestions for how to fix any syntax issues detected"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Error and Warning messages do not include suggested fixes."
    - content: "the line number and information about what caused the error"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Error and Warning messages include a description of the issue and the line number where it occurs."
    - content: "links to help documentation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Error and Warning messages do not include links to documentation."
  - content: "If you are going to create a iteration statement, under which condition is it better create a `while` statement rather than a `do` statement?"
    choices:
    - content: "when, prior to the iteration code block, your code doesn't know the values for the expression that will be evaluated by iteration statement"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A `do` statement would work well in this situation."
    - content: "when, prior to the iteration code block, your code does know the values for the expression that will be evaluated by iteration statement"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When your code is able to evaluate the loop expression prior to the loop, a `while` statement allows your code to implement 0 iterations."
    - content: "when you have an outer `do` or `while` loop and need to create one or more inner loops that use a `do` or `while` statement"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Nesting of loops is not a factor in this decision."
