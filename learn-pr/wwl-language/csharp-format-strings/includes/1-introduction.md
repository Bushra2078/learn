Your team's job is to promote new financial products to the customer. Each letter you send merges personalized information about the customer. The letter compares the returns of their current portfolios with projected returns using the newest products. How will you merge and format the data correctly?

From a high-level perspective, software developers are concerned with:

- **data input**, including data typed in by a user from a keyboard, using their mouse, a device, or by another software system via a network request.
- **data processing**, including decision logic, manipulating data, and performing calculations.
- **data output**, including presentation to an end user via a command-line message, a window, a web page, or saving the processed data into a file, and sending it to a network service.

In this module, you focus on data output. You work with string data formatting it with alignment and spacing. You format data for presentation as currency and other numbers. By the end of this module, you have new tools you can use to output data to the users that conveys and clarifies its meaning.

In this module, you learn how to work with string and numeric data to solve real-world business problems in C#. You create a mockup of a receipt issued for products sold. And you merge data to send a personalized marketing message to customers.

- Merge string templates with variables using composite formatting.

- Introductory experience with literal values of type `string` and `decimal`
- Introductory experience with `Console.WriteLine()`
