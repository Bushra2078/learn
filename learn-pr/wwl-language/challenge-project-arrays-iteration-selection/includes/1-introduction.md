End users often ask developers to create new features for an existing application. Often times this is an indication that the application is being used and that the customer plans to continue using it in the future, hopefully with what they feel are improved features. The ability to update an existing application based on user requests is very important. A successful update will preserve the integrity of the original application while providing the user with the improved experience that they requested.

Suppose you're a teacher's assistant that has been working on an application to help automate the grading process. You've developed a version of the application that uses arrays to supply the application with data, and a combination of iteration and selection statements that fully automate the process of calculating and reporting student grades. Your application even differentiates between exam assignments and extra credit assignments when calculating student grades. It does everything that the teacher wanted. However, as is often the case when providing the customer with a useful application, you've received a request for additional features. The teacher has asked you to update the grading report to show exam and extra credit assignment scores separately from the final numeric score and letter grade.  

This module challenges you to add new capabilities to your Student Grading application.

In short, you need to use the teacher's updated grading report specification to:

- update the iteration and selection code to calculate separate final scores for exams, extra credit assignments, and the overall grade.
- update the code that writes the grading report to the console.

By the end of this module, you'll have an updated version of the Student Grading application that's able to calculate and report student grades in accordance with the teacher's updated requirements.

> This is a challenge project module where you’ll complete an end-to-end project from a specification. This module is intended to be a test of your skills; there’s little guidance and no step-by-step instructions .

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you'll demonstrate your ability to:

- Revise a C# console application that uses nested foreach loops to access array data based on an updated feature specification.
- Update the variables and if statements in a C# console application to create the code branches and calculations required to satisfy an updated feature specification.

## Prerequisites

- Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes.
- Experience using if statements in C# to evaluate an expression and branch code accordingly.
- Experience using a foreach loop to access elements of array variables.
