This module shows you how to deploy an Express.js app from your local computer to Azure App service.

## Your task: deploy the web app to Azure App Service

In this module, you are a web developer or devops engineer who needs to deploy a web app to Azure. As an experienced developer, new to Azure, you will learn how to deploy and configure the Azure resources needed to securely deploy the web app.

## What is the web app?

The web app is a rental property app used by a company to help their employees relocate when needs. The app displays properties, an image about the properties, and some property information.

The rental property web app is built with Express.js. The user interface is created with simple JavaScript and served from the Express.js server. The web app uses fake data stored in a JSON file. The data is read in at runtime and kept in memory. The images are randomly generated. 

Azure App Service is the only Azure service used in this module. 

The entire source code is provided as part of this module. You won't be required to change the code.

## What does the web app do?

The app allows customers to view a range of rental properties. In this module, the data about the homes is pulled from a JSON file and stored in memory.

## What will we be doing?

By the end of this module, using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you'll be able to:

- Create a resource group for the web app
- Create and configure the Azure App Service for an Express.js app - Deploy the web app and view those files on Azure
- Find and view web logs from Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites

Experience with: 

- JavaScript server apps
- Deploying code to other hosting providers
- Securing hosted resources in other cloud environments
- Forking and cloning GitHub repositories

This module uses the Microsoft Learn sandbox, which is available for up to four hours after you create the sandbox. 

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, youâ€™ll learn to create the Azure resources to support the web app, deploy the web app, and view web app logs.
