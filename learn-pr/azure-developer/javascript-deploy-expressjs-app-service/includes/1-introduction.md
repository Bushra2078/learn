This module shows you how to deploy an Express.js app from GitHub to Azure App service.

## Your task: You need to deploy the web app to Azure App Service

In this module, you are a web developer or devops engineer who needs to deploy a web app to Azure. As an experienced developer, new to Azure, you will learn how to deploy and configure the Azure resources needed to securely deploy the web app.

## What is in the web app?

The rental property web app is built with Express.js. The user interface is created with simple JavaScript and served from the Express.js server. The web app uses fake data stored in a JSON file. The data is read in at runtime and kept in memory. The images are randomly generated. 

Azure App Service is the only Azure service used in this module. 

The entire source code is provided as part of this module. You won't be required to change the code.

## What does the web app do?

The app allows customers to view a range of rental properties. In this module, the data about the homes is pulled from a JSON file and stored in memory.
