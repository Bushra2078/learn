## Your task: deploy the web app to Azure App Service

In this module, you're a web developer or devops engineer who needs to deploy a web app to Azure. As an experienced developer, new to Azure, you'll learn how to deploy and configure the Azure resources needed to securely deploy the web app.

## What is the web app?

The web app is a rental property app used by a company to help their employees relocate when needs. The app displays properties, an image about the properties, and some property information.

The rental property web app is built with Express.js. The user interface is created with simple JavaScript and served from the Express.js server. The web app uses fake data stored in a JSON file. The data is read in at runtime and kept in memory. The images are randomly generated. 

The entire source code is provided as part of this module. You won't be required to change the code.

## How will you complete this task?

By the end of this module, using Visual Studio Code or the Azure portal, you'll be able to:

- Use the free Learn sandbox subscription and resource group
- Create and configure the Azure App Service for an Express.js app
- Deploy the web app from your local computer
- View the cloud-based files from your local computer
- View web logs 

## What will you complete?

When you complete this module, you have a deployed Express.js app on your own App Service resource. You know the top app settings to configure the app correctly and you've found the log files and 404 errors for the web app.
