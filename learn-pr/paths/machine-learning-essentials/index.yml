title: Essential data science for machine learning  
summary: |
  Machine learning is powered by simple but effective ways that data scientists make predictions about objects, people, and the future. This learning path is a high-level introduction to machine learning for people with little or no knowledge of computer science or statistics. You’ll review the essentials of machine learning and cover the foundational data science concepts needed to create, test, and understand machine learning models.

  From the most basic classical machine learning models, to exploratory data analysis and customizing architectures, you’ll be guided by easy to digest conceptual content and interactive Jupyter notebooks, all without leaving your browser.
