title: Deploy Azure resources by using Bicep and Azure Pipelines
summary: |
  Gain all of the benefits of infrastructure as code by using an automated pipeline to deploy your Bicep templates, 
  and integrate other deployment activities with your pipelines. You'll build pipelines using Azure Pipelines.

  Take this learning path to learn how to:

  * Build a pipeline that deploys your Bicep files.
  * Create a service principal that can securely connect your pipeline to Azure.
  * Ensure your Bicep code quality by validating and testing it within your pipeline.
  * Work with multiple environments, and handle parameters and approvals.
  * Deploy other Azure configuration settings, applications, and databases.

  To learn about Bicep, we recommend you take these two learning paths:
