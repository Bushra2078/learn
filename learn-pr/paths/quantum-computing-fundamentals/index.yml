summary: | 
  Intrigued by quantum computing but don't know where to start? This learning path helps prepare you for this exciting next generation of computing. 
  This learning path includes several modules, but you donâ€™t need to take the modules in order. We recommend starting with [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/) 
  and [Explore the key concepts of quantum computing by using Q#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/qsharp-explore-key-concepts-quantum-computing/) modules to familiarize with quantum computing and the Quantum Development Kit. 
  Beyond this point, we encourage you to create your own path.
  
  If you are here because you want to learn more about quantum computing, you can continue with [Solve graph coloring problems by using Grover's search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/) module, and then follow
  follow these modules to learn how to do quantum computing in the cloud, [Get started with Azure Quantum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-azure-quantum/) and (Run algorithms on quantum hardware by using Azure Quantum)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/run-algorithms-quantum-hardware-azure-quantum/]

  If you want to delve into optimization solutions, you can check this module [Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/), 
  and then follow [Get started with Azure Quantum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-azure-quantum/) and [Solve a job shop scheduling optimization problem by using Azure Quantum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/solve-job-shop-optimization-azure-quantum/) modules. 
  
  After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:
  - Explain the fundamental concepts of quantum computing.
  - Build basic quantum programs by using the Quantum Development Kit and Q#.
  - Identify the kinds of problems quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
  - Use the Azure Quantum Workspace.
  - Adapt and create Q# applications to run them in Azure Quantum.
  - Apply quantum-inspired optimization to a real-world problem.
  - Solve a job shop scheduling optimization problem.
