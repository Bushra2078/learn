title: Quantum computing foundations
summary: | 
  Intrigued by quantum computing but don't know where to start? This learning path helps prepare you for this exciting next generation of computing.

  After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:
  - Explain the fundamental concepts of quantum computing.
  - Build basic quantum programs by using the Quantum Development Kit and Q#.
  - Identify the kinds of problems quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
  - Use the Azure Quantum Workspace.
  - Adapt and create Q# applications to run them in Azure Quantum.
  - Apply quantum-inspired optimization to a real-world problem.
  - Solve a job shop scheduling optimization problem.
