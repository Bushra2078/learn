  > [!NOTE]
  > You don't need to take modules in order. 
  > If you want to learn more about quantum computing, follow [Solve graph coloring problems by using Grover's search](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/) and
 [Run algorithms on quantum hardware by using Azure Quantum](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/run-algorithms-quantum-hardware-azure-quantum/) modules.
  > If you want to delve into optimization solutions, follow [Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/) 
  and [Solve a job shop scheduling optimization problem by using Azure Quantum](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-job-shop-optimization-azure-quantum/) modules. 
  
  After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:
  - Explain the fundamental concepts of quantum computing.
  - Build basic quantum programs by using the Quantum Development Kit and Q#.
  - Identify the kinds of problems quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
  - Use the Azure Quantum Workspace.
  - Adapt and create Q# applications to run them in Azure Quantum.
  - Apply quantum-inspired optimization to a real-world problem.
  - Solve a job shop scheduling optimization problem.
