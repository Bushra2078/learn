summary: |
  Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

  Whether you're a developer or simply someone who wants to get a feel for what quantum computing is all about, this learning path is a great place to start exploring quantum computing.

  Imagine you're the new member of a space crew. The spaceship is equipped with a computer that has access to the Azure Quantum servers on Earth and you can use the power of quantum computing to complete different tasks. During your training as a new crew member, you'll learn about quantum computing and how to use the Microsoft Azure Quantum service.

  Welcome aboard!

  After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:
  - Explain the fundamental concepts of quantum computing.
  - Identify the kinds of problems quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
  - Build basic quantum programs by using the Quantum Development Kit and Q#.
  - Interact with the Azure Quantum cloud service.
  - Adapt and create Q# applications to run them on actual hardware.
  - Apply quantum-inspired optimization to a combinatorial optimization problem.
  - Solve a job shop scheduling optimization problem.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You don't need to take the modules in the listed order. Take a look at each module's description and prerequisites. Many modules do not have prior requirements.
  > If you would like to use the Azure Quantum cloud service, for either quantum computing or optimization, start with the [first module](/learn/modules/get-started-azure-quantum).
  > If you would like to learn more about quantum programming using the Quantum Development Kit and the Q# programming language, feel free to jump to [your first Q# program](/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit).
