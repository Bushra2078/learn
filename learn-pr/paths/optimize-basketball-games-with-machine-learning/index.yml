title: Use basketball stats to optimize gameplay with Visual Studio Code, inspired by SPACE JAM A NEW LEGACY
summary: | 
  Learning how to apply coding and technical skills to existing passions opens doors to new discoveries, interests,
  and even careers. We know the importants of stats within sports; whether you're using them to improve your fantasy
  team throughout the season, or using them to better understand your team and root for players to be drafted to your
  favorite team - it's not just the players and the games that matter, it's the culmination of it all that creates the sport.

  Microsoft has become inspired by the new film SPACE JAM A NEW LEGACY to create this learning path
  that guides you through the critical stats that determine a each player's PER (player efficiency rating). This rating 
  can help coaches make decisions about drafting, choosing starting line ups, and even in-game moments like when to have a player
  take a water break for optimal chances of winning a game. 

  Welcome to the Jam!  NBA champion and cultural icon LeBron James goes on an epic adventure alongside timeless 
  Tune Bugs Bunny with the animated/live-action event “Space Jam: A New Legacy,” from director Malcolm D. Lee 
  and an innovative filmmaking team including Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.  This transformational journey 
  is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. 
  When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home 
  safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over 
  the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of NBA and WNBA stars as you’ve never seen 
  them before.  It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s 
  bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy 
  convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even “King” James by playing the game their own way. 
  
  We want to align with the movie's messaging and create
  opportunities for basketball fans to see how learning a bit of data science and coding could support their passions even more, 
  and even open doors to possible careers. Using Visual Studio Code, Azure, GitHub, JavaScript, and Python, you will be able to discover your own insights
  on how individual moments throughout a players history can lead to a critical game decision in the finals. 
  
  These modules are a part of a 
  multi-modal approach to learning, meaning you can also follow along with some video tutorials that are a part of the 
  [Learn with Dr G Learn TV video series](https://aks.ms/LearnWithDrG/SpaceJamANewLegacyVideos). And don't forget to watch SPACE JAM A NEW LEGACY in theaters Summer 2021!
  
  In this learning path you will:
  - Use Python, Pandas, and Visual Studio Code to understand basketball stats
  - Use machine learning to cleanse and impute missing data from datasets
  - Discover how to identify bimodal data across human and Tune Squad basketball players
  - Explore the CodeTour extension in Visual Studio Code for code writing guidance
  - Create a Water Break App with JavaScript and Azure static web apps
  - Use GitHub Actions to deploy your app to the cloud
