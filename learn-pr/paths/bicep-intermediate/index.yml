title: Intermediate Bicep
summary: |
  Bicep enables you to deploy Azure resources. Bicep uses a declarative syntax that you treat like application code.
  Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your
  deployments more consistent and repeatable.

  Take this learning path to deepen your understanding of Bicep. In it, you'll:

  * Deploy child and extension resources.
  * Add your Bicep code to the Git version control system to track its history and collaborate with team members.
  * Follow proven best practices to create high-quality Bicep code.
  * Ensure reusability, consistency, and compliance by creating libraries of modules and templates.
  * Use the what-if command to check the effects of your Bicep files before you deploy them.

  *NOTE TO REVIEWERS: The module 'Consume and publish Bicep modules by using registries' will be added to this path around December.*

  To learn about Bicep, we recommend you take these three learning paths:
