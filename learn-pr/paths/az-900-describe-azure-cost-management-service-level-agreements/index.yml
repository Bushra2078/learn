  As you move to the cloud, you might ask:

  * How much will it cost?
  * What guarantees does Azure provide around uptime and connectivity?
  * How do preview services impact my production applications?

  Learn about the factors that influence cost, tools you can use to help estimate and manage your cloud spend, and how Azure's service-level agreements (SLAs) can impact your application design decisions.
