  title: Architect modern applications with Cloud Native Apps 
  description: Cloud-native apps represent a modern approach to app development, where software systems are designed with cloud technologies in mind. Cloud-native apps make the end-to-end process of building an application easier, with a focus on architectural modularity, rather than monolithic, all-in-one applications. You can utilize the technologies that suit your skillset and situation, without being locked into technology choices.

title: Architect modern applications with Cloud Native Apps
summary: |
  Cloud-native apps represent a modern approach to app development, where software systems are designed with cloud technologies in mind. Cloud-native apps make the end-to-end process of building an application easier, with a focus on architectural modularity, rather than monolithic, all-in-one applications. You can utilize the technologies that suit your skillset and situation, without being locked into technology choices.

  This learning path covers the essentials of selecting components for cloud-native apps, and how to tie them all together for a modern, modular approach to building applications. Cloud-native apps different from more traditional approaches to building software such as microservices because while you'll use Open-Source Software (OSS) like Docker and Node.js, you can turn to proprietary offerings like Azure Kubernetes Service and Cosmos DB when the benefit is overwhelming.

  You'll create multiple services, processing both large scale of messages from devices and streaming data from IoT devices.
