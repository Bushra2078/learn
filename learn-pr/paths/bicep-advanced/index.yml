title: Advanced Bicep
summary: |
  Bicep enables you to deploy Azure resources. Bicep uses a declarative syntax that you treat like application code.
  Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your
  deployments more consistent and repeatable.

  Take this learning path to deepen your understanding of how to use Bicep to deploy your Azure resources. In it, you'll:

  * Deploy advanced Azure resource types, including child and extension resources.
  * Deploy resources at the subscription, management group, and tenant level.
  * Build deployment scripts that define custom steps in your Bicep templates.

  To learn about Bicep, we recommend you take these three learning paths:

  After that, you might be interested in adding your Bicep code to a deployment pipeline. Take one of these two learning paths based on the tool you want to use:
