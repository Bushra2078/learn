title: Advanced Bicep
summary: |
  Bicep enables you to deploy Azure resources. Bicep uses a declarative syntax that you treat like application code.
  Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your
  deployments more consistent and repeatable.

  Take this learning path to understand how you can use Bicep with complex deployment scenarios. In it, you'll:

  * Deploy advanced Azure resource types, and understand the Azure resource model.
  * Deploy resources at the subscription, management group, and tenant level.
  * Build deployment scripts that define custom steps in your Bicep templates.
  * Migrate JSON ARM templates to Bicep to make your existing Azure deployment templates easier to read and maintain.
  * Use Bicep to work with resources you've previously deployed using the Azure portal or other tooling to make your deployments repeatable and consistent.

  *NOTE TO REVIEWERS: The untitled module about deployment stacks will be added to this path in early 2022.*

  To learn about Bicep, we recommend you take these three learning paths:

  After that, you might be interested in adding your Bicep code to a deployment pipeline. Take one of these two learning paths based on the tool you want to use:
