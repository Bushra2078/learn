title: Deploy Azure resources by using Bicep and GitHub Actions
summary: | 
  Gain all of the benefits of infrastructure as code by using an automated workflow to deploy your Bicep templates, 
  and integrate other deployment activities with your workflows. You'll build workflows using GitHub Actions.

  Take this learning path to learn how to:

  * Build a workflow that deploys your Bicep files.
  * Create a service principal that can securely connect your workflow to Azure.
  * Ensure your Bicep code quality by validating and testing it within your workflow.

  To learn about Bicep, we recommend you take these three learning paths:

  After that, you might be interested in adding your Bicep code to a deployment pipeline. Take one of these two learning paths based on the tool you want to use:
