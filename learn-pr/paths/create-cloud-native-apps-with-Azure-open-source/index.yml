title: Create cloud native apps with Azure and open-source software
summary: |
  Cloud-native apps represent a modern approach to app development, where software systems are designed with cloud scale and capabilities in mind. Cloud-native apps build on open source technologies where feasible, with a focus on architectural modularity. In focusing on open technologies, "Cloud Native", means flexibility in terms of deployment, while still being able to leverage Azure-specific services like CosmosDb and Azure Active Directory.

  This learning path covers the essentials of selecting components for cloud-native apps, and how to tie them all together.

  You'll create multiple services, processing both large scale of messages from devices and streaming data from IoT devices.
