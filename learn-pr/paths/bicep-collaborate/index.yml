  * Work effectively with example Bicep code, auto-generated Bicep files, and the Azure Resource Manager documentation.
  * Ensure consistency and compliance by creating libraries of templates.
  * Use the what-if command to check the effects of your deployments.
  * Migrate ARM templates to Bicep.
  * Use Bicep to work with resources you've previously deployed using the Azure portal or other tooling.
