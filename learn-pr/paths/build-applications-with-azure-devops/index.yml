  Azure DevOps enables you to build, test, and deploy any application to any cloud. Learn how configure build pipelines that continuously build, test, and verify your applications.

  In this learning path, you will:
    - Build your application and collaborate with others using Azure Pipelines and GitHub
    - Run automated testing in your pipeline to validate code quality
    - Scan your source code and third-party components for potential vulnerabilities
    - Define multiple build pipelines that work together to build your application
    - Build applications using both Microsoft-hosted agents and your own build agents
