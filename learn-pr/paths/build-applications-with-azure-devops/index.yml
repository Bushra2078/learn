title: Build applications with Azure DevOps
summary: |

  Azure DevOps enables you to build, test, and deploy any application to any cloud or on premises. Learn how configure build pipelines that continuously build, test, and verify your applications.

  In this learning path, you will:
  - Collaborate with others to build your applications using Azure Pipelines and GitHub
  - Run automated tests in your pipeline to validate code quality
  - Scan your source code and third-party components for potential vulnerabilities
  - Define multiple pipelines that work together to build your application
  - Build applications using both Microsoft-hosted agents and your own build agents
