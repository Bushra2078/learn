title: Explore space with Python, Visual Studio Code, and Over the Moon Magic
summary: | 
  Learning to code sometimes feels out of reach - but if we've learned anything from 
  the people who have bursted through our atmosphere, orbited our Earth, or walked on
  the Moon, goals that seem out of reach simply require determination and passion. 
  That that's the goal of this [Over the Moon](https://www.netflix.com/title/80214236) 
  inspired learning path. Over the Moon is a Netflix original film that inspires the 
  curiosity and determination needed for all of us to reach our goals. 
  
  Over the Moon follows Fei Fei, on her journey to build a rocket to
  fly to the moon. These modules were inspired by her story and the story of real NASA
  engineers and astronauts. Tying together principles of data science, machine learning, and
  artificial intelligence with tools like Python, Visual Studio Code, and Azure, these modules
  guide you through upskilling in tech while imagining how to solve space travel related 
  challenges. These modules are a part of a multi-modal approach to learning, meaning you can 
  also follow along with some video tutorials that are a part of the 
  [Learn with Dr G Learn TV video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG).
  
  Through these modules, you will learn how to:
    - Gather data from multiple sources 
    - Aggregate data into Pandas dataframes
    - Use Python and Pandas to explore data 
    - The strategies for cleansing and manipulating your data
    - Create a good dataset of images for training AIs
    - Ensure ethical practices throughout AI development
    - Hypothesize how much rock sample astronauts should collect
    - Identify and predict meteor showers
    - Train a custom vision AI on a particular animal
