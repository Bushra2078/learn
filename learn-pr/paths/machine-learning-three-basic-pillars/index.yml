title: 'Machine learning: Regression, classification, and clustering'
summary: |
  Welcome to the Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, and Clustering Learning Path! The content in this learning path pairs with in person workshops that run in Microsoft Reactors and are standalone learning resources (you don't have to come to a workshop to benefit from these modules).
  Throughout this Learning Path you will be encouraged to test out Python code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) using the Python extension and Jupyter Notebooks.

  In this learning path, you'll:
    - Learn ways to prepare data for analysis 
    - Learn to fit linear-regression models
    - Learn about the kinds of results obtained with theÂ k-means algorithm

  Complementary content for Microsoft Reactor Workshops.
