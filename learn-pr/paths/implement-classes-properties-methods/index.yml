title: Implement classes, properties, and methods
prerequisites: |
  - Installation of Visual Studio Code that's configured for C# application development, including C# Dev Kit
  - Experience with the VS Code editor
  - Ability to develop C# console applications that implement business logic using loops, if statements, properties, and methods
  - Experience with basic C# syntax rules
summary: |
  Your goal was to learn about the differences between a class and an object and how a class is the blueprint for an object. You then went on to learn about encapsulation (or data hiding in a class) and an object's lifecycle. The term lifecycle refers to the allocation and deallocation of memory for an object. You learned about constructors and that they're used to initialize values in an object. Finally, you learned that namespaces are used to organize your classes into groups to avoid collisions of resources that may have the same name.
