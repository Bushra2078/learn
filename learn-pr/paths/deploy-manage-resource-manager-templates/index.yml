title: Deploy and manage resources in Azure by using ARM templates
summary: |
  Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates enable you to describe the infrastructure requirements for your deployments on Azure.

  ARM templates use a declarative syntax that you treat like application code. Infrastructure as code makes your deployments consistent and repeatable. 

  Take this learning path to learn:

  * How ARM templates are structured
  * Recommended practices when building ARM templates
  * How to use features such as what-if and the ARM template test toolkit to validate and preview your infrastructure changes before you deploy.

  You'll also work with Visual Studio Code extensions that help you quickly create and validate your templates. You'll deploy your templates from the command line by using either the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell. Then you'll automate your workflow even further by deploying your templates through GitHub Actions.
prerequisites: Familiarity with Azure Resource Manager and Azure resource groups is recommended, but not required
