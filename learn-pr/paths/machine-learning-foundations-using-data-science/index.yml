title: Foundations of data science for machine learning
summary: |
  Microsoft Learn provides several interactive ways to get an interactive introduction to classic machine learning. "Classic machine learning" refers to models other than deep learning models. Whether you plan to move on to learning deep learning in detail or not, all of these options are a great place to start.

  From the most basic classical machine learning models, to exploratory data analysis and customizing architectures, you’ll be guided by easy to digest conceptual content and interactive Jupyter notebooks, all without leaving your browser.

  Choose your own path depending on your educational background and interests.
  
  ### Option 1: The complete data science for classic machine learning course 
  This is the recommended option for most people. It has all the same modules as the other two learning paths with a custom flow that maximizes reinforcement of concepts. If you want to learn about both the underlying concepts as well as how to get into building models with the most common machine learning tools this is the path for you. It's also the best path if you plan to move beyond classic machine learning, and get an education in deep learning and neural networks, which we only introduce here.

  ✔ You are currently on this path, scroll down to begin.
  
  ### Option 2: The _Understand data science for machine learning_ learning path
  If you are looking to understand how machine learning works and have little mathematical background then this path is for you. It makes no assumptions about previous education (other than a very light familiarity with coding concepts) and teaches with code, metaphor, and visual that give you the ah ha moment. It's hands-on, but focuses more on understanding fundamentals and less on the power of the tools and libraries available.

  ### Option 3: The _Create machine learning models_ learning path
  If you already have some idea what machine learning is about or you have a strong mathematical background you may best enjoy jumping right in to the _Create Machine Learning Models_ learning path. These modules teach some machine learning concepts, but move fast so they can get to the power of using tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. This is also the best learning path for you if you're looking for just enough familiarity to understand machine learning examples for products like Azure ML or Azure Databricks

prerequisites: |
  This learning path assumes knowledge of basic mathematical concepts. Some experience with Python is also beneficial. To get started with Python, complete the [Take your first steps with Python](../python-first-steps/index.yml) learning path.
