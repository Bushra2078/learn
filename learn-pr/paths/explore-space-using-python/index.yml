title: Explore space with Python and Visual Studio Code; inspired by Netflix's Over the Moon
summary: | 
  Learning to code sometimes feels out of reach. But if we've learned anything from 
  the people who have burst through our atmosphere, orbited our Earth, or walked on
  the Moon, goals that seem out of reach simply require determination and passion. 
  That's the goal of this [Over the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26DIABx44Tw?azure-portal=true)–inspired learning path. 
 
  <i>Over the Moon</i> is a film about Fei Fei, a young girl who builds a rocket to the Moon 
  on a mission to prove the existence of a legendary Moon Goddess. Fei Fei is fueled 
  by the memories and love of her mother to use her determination and imagination to 
  accomplish something beyond this world: reach the Moon. Although the story takes place 
  in a beautifully drawn universe, it's directly related to the types of problems 
  real-life engineers face as they prepare and execute missions to the Moon and beyond.

  These modules were inspired by Fei Fei's story and the story of real NASA
  engineers and astronauts. Tying together principles of data science, machine learning, and
  artificial intelligence with tools like Python, Visual Studio Code, and Azure, these modules
  guide you through upskilling in tech while imagining how to solve space travel–related 
  challenges. These modules are part of a multimodal approach to learning—follow along with some video tutorials that are part of the 
  [Learn with Dr. G Learn TV video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG?azure-portal=true). And don't forget
  to watch [Over the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26DIABx44Tw?azure-portal=true) on Netflix today!
  
  Through these modules, you will learn how to:
    - Gather data from multiple sources 
    - Aggregate data into pandas DataFrames
    - Use Python and pandas to explore data 
    - Use smart strategies to cleanse and manipulate your data
    - Create a good dataset of images for training AIs
    - Ensure ethical practices throughout AI development
    - Hypothesize how much rock sample astronauts should collect
    - Identify and predict meteor showers
    - Train a Custom Vision AI model on a particular animal
