title: Add logic to your applications with C#
summary: |
  Deepen your experience with C# logic and iteration statements, Boolean expressions, and code blocks in this Learning Path.

  In this learning path, you'll:
    - Build more complex and expressive Boolean expressions
    - Use code blocks to control variable scope and the execution path of your code
    - Branch the flow of code using the `switch-case` statement
    - Iterate through a code block with the `for`, `while` and `do-while` statements
  
  Once you complete this learning path, you'll have a stronger grasp of implementing logic in your C# code.
prerequisites: |
    - Beginner level experience with C# concepts including declaring, initializing, and using variables
    - Beginner level experience with the `if-elseif-else` statement
    - Beginner level experience with arrays and the `foreach` statement
