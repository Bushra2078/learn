> [!TIP]
> Azure Cloud Shell includes an [integrated file editor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/using-cloud-shell-editor). The Cloud Shell editor supports features such as language highlighting, the command palette, and a file explorer. For simple file creation and editing, launch the editor by running `code .` in the Cloud Shell terminal. This action opens the editor with your active working directory set in the terminal. To directly open a file for quick editing, run `code <filename>` to open the editor without the file explorer. To open the editor via UI button, click the `{}` editor icon from the toolbar. This will open the editor and default the file explorer to the `/home/<user>` directory.
