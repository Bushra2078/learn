Fundraising is the process of soliciting and obtaining financial or in-kind support for your organization or project. Fundraising can be challenging, especially for nonprofits and social enterprises that have limited resources and staff. Copilot can help you with fundraising by providing you with:
  - Ideas: Copilot can generate ideas for fundraising campaigns, events, products, or services that match your mission and audience.
  - Strategies: Copilot can suggest strategies for reaching out to potential donors, such as segmentation, targeting, personalization, and follow-up.
  - Plans: Copilot can create plans for executing your fundraising activities, such as timelines, budgets, tasks, and metrics.
Let’s consider a family services nonprofit organization helping families to be equipped with basic items. To use Copilot for fundraising, you can simply type your request in natural language. Here are some sample prompts that can be used for fundraising: 

1. Write a catchy and persuasive article for our crowdfunding campaign that emphasizes the urgent need for diapers in low-income families.
2. Create a budget for our gala dinner for 200 people, including the estimated costs of venue, catering, a DJ, marketing campaign, and staff.
3. Create a flyer for local high schools advertising the need for volunteers at our fill the bus diaper drive, including date, location, time slots available, and benefits of volunteering.

Copilot will then produce a response that meets your request, such as a list of ideas, a strategy outline, or a plan template. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples.
