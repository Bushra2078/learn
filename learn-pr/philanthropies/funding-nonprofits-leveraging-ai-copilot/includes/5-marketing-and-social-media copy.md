Marketing or social media is the process of creating and sharing compelling stories, images, and videos that showcase your impact and attract more supporters. Marketing or social media can be essential for raising awareness, building trust, and generating interest for your organization or project. Copilot can help you with marketing or social media by providing you with:
  - Stories: Copilot can generate and edit stories that highlight your mission, vision, values, and impact, such as case studies, success stories, and impact stories.
  - Images: Copilot can create and enhance images that illustrate your work, such as photos, graphics, and logos.
Using Copilot for marketing or social media, here are prompt examples using the family services nonprofit organization:
1.	Develop a social media strategy targeting potential donors and explain how they can make a difference by supporting the families in need in our community.
2.	Share a testimonial from a family who benefited from the support we provided and explain how others can help through contributions or by volunteering at the weekly food bank.
3.	Create a formal presentation for a fundraising pitch at our gala. Include images of the volunteers in action, the number of people we served last year and the amount of food, clothing, and other essentials we provided.
Copilot will then produce a response that meets your request, such as a story text, an image file, or a video link. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples.
Let’s try this prompt in Copilot. “Our organization is running a summer volunteer initiative for career coaching for career switchers. Can you create social media postings tailored to each of the following platforms: X/Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook?”

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that will be solved by the content in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "In the shoe-company scenario, we will use a Twitter trigger to launch our app when tweets containing our product name are available."
-->
TODO: add your scenario sub-task

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what's covered in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will learn the policy factors that are controlled by a storage account so you can decide how many accounts you need."
-->
TODO: write your prose table-of-contents

<!-- 4. Visual element (highly recommended) ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Visual element, like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote. Ideally, you'll provide an image that illustrates the customer problem the unit will solve; it can use the scenario to do this or stay generic (i.e. not address the scenario).

    Heading: none

TODO: add a visual element

<!-- 5. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to perform this sub-task.

        1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. 1-3 paragraphs of text
        3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote.
