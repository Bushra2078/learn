<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: remind the learner of the core idea(s) from the preceding learning-content unit (without mentioning the details of the exercise or the scenario)

    Heading: none

    Example: "A storage account represents a collection of settings that implement a business policy."

Grant management and writing is the process of finding, applying, and reporting on grants from foundations, governments, and corporations. Grant management and writing can be time-consuming and complex, especially for nonprofits and social enterprises that deal with multiple grantors and requirements. Copilot can help you with grant management and writing by providing you with:
  - Opportunities: Copilot can search and filter grant opportunities that match your criteria, such as sector, location, amount, and deadline.
  - Applications: Copilot can generate and edit grant applications that follow the grantor's guidelines, such as format, structure, and content.
  - Reports: Copilot can create and update grant reports that demonstrate your impact, such as outcomes, indicators, and stories.
Letâ€™s consider the same nonprofit organization. To use Copilot for grant management and writing, you can simply type your request in natural language. Here are prompt examples: 
1.	Write a letter of inquiry requesting funding for a capital campaign, including your current and projected sources of income and expenses and how you plan to use the funds.
2.	Update a grant report for our annual appeal that shows how the utility assistance program and clothing and housewares center have helped enable low-income families to achieve self-sufficiency.
3.	Draft a grant application requesting funding for operating costs including staffing and supplies. 



Copilot will then produce a response that meets your request, such as a list of opportunities, an application draft, or a report summary. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples.

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario covered in this exercise

    Heading: a separate heading is optional; you can combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Recall that in the chocolate-manufacturer example, there would be a separate storage account for the private business data. There were two key requirements for this account: geographically-redundant storage because the data is business-critical and at least one location close to the main factory."

    Recommended: image that summarizes the entire scenario with a highlight of the area implemented in this exercise
-->
TODO: add your scenario sub-task
TODO: add your scenario image

<!-- 3. Task performed in the exercise ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what they'll implement here; that is, describe the end-state after completion

    Heading: a separate heading is optional; you can combine this with the sub-task into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will create a storage account with settings appropriate to hold this mission-critical business data."

    Optional: a video that shows the end-state
-->
TODO: describe the end-state

<!-- 4. Chunked steps -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the steps they'll do to complete the exercise.

    Structure: Break the steps into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. A heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. An introductory paragraph describing the goal of the chunk at a high level
        3. Numbered steps (target 7 steps or fewer in each chunk)

    Example:
        Heading:
            "Use a template for your Azure logic app"
        Introduction:
             "When you create an Azure logic app in the Azure portal, you have the option of selecting a starter template. Let's select a blank template so that we can build our logic app from scratch."
        Steps:
             "1. In the left navigation bar, select Resource groups.
              2. Select the existing Resource group [sandbox resource group name].
              3. Select the ShoeTracker logic app.
              4. Scroll down to the Templates section and select Blank Logic App."

1. <!-- Step 2 -->
1. <!-- Step n -->

## (Chunk 2 heading)
<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
1. <!-- Step 1 -->
1. <!-- Step 2 -->
1. <!-- Step n -->

## (Chunk n heading)
<!-- Introduction paragraph -->
1. <!-- Step 1 -->
1. <!-- Step 2 -->
1. <!-- Step n -->

<!-- 5. Validation -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Enables the learner to evaluate if they completed the exercise correctly. Feedback like this is critical for learning.

    Structure:
        1. A heading of "## Check your work".
        2. An introductory paragraph describing how they'll validate their work at a high level.
        3. Numbered steps (if the learner needs to perform multiple steps to verify if they were successful).
        4. Video of an expert performing the exact steps of the exercise (optional).

    Example:
         "At this point, the app is scanning Twitter every minute for tweets containing the search text. To verify the app is running and working correctly, we'll look at the Runs history table."
             "1. Select Overview in the navigation menu.
              2. Select Refresh once a minute until you see a row in the Runs history table.
              ...
              6. Examine the data in the OUTPUTS section. For example, locate the text of the matching tweet."
