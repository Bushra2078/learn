AI can shape the future of learning, promoting innovation and increasing effectiveness. Its impact is evident in multiple aspects of education, as AI's continuous technological growth can propel learning towards greater adaptability, accessibility, and personalization.

Below are some examples of how various educational entities have used AI to enhance learning:

1. AI enables organizations and entities with vast data sets to unlock the potential data to drive rapid growth. An example is the Nebraska Department of Education's innovative response to the immense workload of collecting data from numerous schools. They realized that data collection took 655,000 staff hours annually, which was a huge drain. In response, they harnessed AI to build a Statewide Longitudinal Data System.<sup>2</sup> The AI system facilitates a seamless flow of near-real-time information from diverse sources, offering actionable insights to leaders, administrators, and educators at various levels.

1. In higher education, universities harness AI to elevate learner experiences beyond the confines of a traditional classroom through intelligent campus initiatives.<sup>3</sup> One example is the integration of chatbots into learner support services to elevate learner experiences. Sam from Griffith University supports learners by swiftly locating relevant information, while the University of Sydney's FinBot addresses financial queries promptly.

1. In the realm of equity, AI empowers government departments to break through barriers and enrich learners' prospects. The Philippine Department of Education's innovative deployment of Reading Progress fosters language proficiency, reading fluency, pronunciation, and digital literacy.<sup>4</sup> They have implemented Reading Progress which allow learners to practice their language skills and receive tailored feedback and assignments. The tools also allow learners to correct errors and refine pronunciation, nurturing essential skills for long-term success.

1. Moreover, AI is propelling cities towards digital transformation, significantly impacting education. Helsinki's Education Division developed an AI hub to enhance pedagogy across multiple areas of its education system. Uses for AI included pedagogical leadership dashboards, ensuring timely completion of studies, nurturing socio-emotional skills, automating feedback, enabling adaptive learning processes, and harnessing big data for research.<sup>5</sup> Helsinki's transformative strategy involves perceiving the entire city as an interconnected learning environment and treating each learner as a unique and equal individual. The emphasis lies on personalized learning experiences, improved learning outcomes, and overall learner well-being, underscoring AI's role in modern education paradigms.
