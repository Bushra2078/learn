Microsoft Copilot, an AI tool, can significantly support you in creating learning-centered training plans. It can help you create personalized plans by generating content tailored to individual learners' needs and preferences. This customized approach can engage learners with improved materials that enhance their understanding. It can also complement existing pedagogical approaches and introduce innovative methods for training. By using Microsoft Copilot, you can create comprehensive, effective, and learner-centered training plans.

## Task

This activity involves using Microsoft Copilot to design a personalized training plan. Think of a topic you would like to teach in an upcoming training session. This topic is used to create your plans. After using Microsoft Copilot, you'll write up a formal training program for your specific training topic. This task requires a computer or mobile device with internet access, and a pen and paper or word processor for reflection afterward.

The learning design should follow the following format. Follow each step in the table that follows to create your personal training plan.

| Lesson design element | Explanation |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Learning objective | Create a learning objective to solve the problem. The learning objective should follow the SMART principle (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound).<br><br>Use these prompts in Microsoft Copilot:<br>- Create a learning objective for a learner-centered [insert topic] training session. Use the SMART format.<br>- Evaluate this learning objective: [insert the learning objective]. Make sure it's aligned with the SMART format. |
| Preassessment questions | The Preassessment measures learners' strengths, weaknesses, prior knowledge, and experience in time management. It also provides data to guide personalization of the learning experience.<br><br>Use these prompts in Microsoft Copilot:<br>- What are good Preassessment questions to use for a [insert topic] training program?<br>- Create Preassessment questions for a learner-centered [insert topic] training session. Here's the learning objective: [insert the learning objective]. |
| Learning activities | The learning activities should engage learners with active and meaningful examples relevant to the scenario, problem, or challenge. They should also provide opportunities for learners to practice and apply their knowledge and skills in authentic contexts. These learning activities should require learners to use AI tools such as Microsoft Copilot or Microsoft Teams.<br><br>Use these prompts in Microsoft Copilot:<br>- Provide activity ideas for a learner-centered [insert topic] training program.<br>- What AI tools can I utilize to help run the program?<br>- How would you incorporate [insert AI tools you want to use] into [insert the activity you want to do]? |
| Post-assessment questions | The post-assessment should evaluate learners' achievement of the learning objective and their task performance. It should also provide feedback and recognize their accomplishments and challenges.<br><br>Use these prompts in Microsoft Copilot:<br>- What are good post-assessment questions to use for a [insert topic] training program?<br>- Create post-assessment questions for a learner-centered [insert topic] training session. Here's the learning objective [insert the learning objective]. |
| Reflection | Reflection should guide learners in identifying their strengths, areas for improvement, emotions, and attitudes related to the task. This section should also help learners set goals for future learning and advancement.<br><br>Use these prompts in Microsoft Copilot:<br>- Can you share examples of reflection questions for a learner-centered [insert topic] training session?<br>- Evaluate this question list for me; is it already a good reflection question? [insert the question list]. |
| Evaluation | Evaluation is a strategy for measuring the effectiveness and impact of your training program.<br><br>Use these prompts in Microsoft Copilot:<br>- What evaluation format should I use to measure the efficacy of a training program whose learning objective is: [insert the learning objective]?<br>- What data should I gather to run the evaluation? |
