Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

Whether you're a researcher or simply want to get a feel for what quantum programming is all about, this is a great place to start exploring Microsoft's approach to quantum computing.

In this module, you'll write your very first quantum program by using the Quantum Development Kit (QDK). The QDK enables you to write and test your quantum programs locally through a simulator, on standard hardware. You can later run the same quantum program on real quantum hardware.

The quantum program you'll write generates random numbers. A random number generator is not only easy to write, but helps you understand the basics of quantum computing.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll: TODO

- Prepare your development environment for writing quantum programs
- Understand how to use Q# to express quantum algorithms
- Start your journey as a quantum developer
- Learn how to contribute to the open-source quantum community
- TODO: How to combine classical and quantum logic...

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of quantum computing concepts.
- The latest version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download?azure-portal=true).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true).

## What you will do in this module

TODO

In the following units you will go through these steps:

- Install the QDK extension in Visual Studio Code
- Create a Q# project
- Combine Q# and Python to create a quantum random number generator
- As a call to action: learn more about QDK and Q# on the docs page, practice quantum programming on quantum katas and contribute to the QDK
