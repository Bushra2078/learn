Congratulations, you have completed your first experience writing a Q# program using the QDK.
In this module you learned how to:

- prepare your development environment for writing quantum programs
- use Q# to express quantum algorithms


## Learn more

You have started your journey as a quantum developer. Keep it up! 

You can learn more about developing quantum algorithms from the [Microsoft Quantum Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/). 

You will find information on: 

- options for using Q# with C#, Python or Jupyter notebooks
- other step-by-step quickstarts for learning Q#
- more [code samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/browse/?languages=qsharp) such as building a teleportation algorithm, doing a Grover search, running a CHSH game, etc.
- [quantum katas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/intro-to-katas) for practicing quantum programming 
- information on the standard libraries, and libraries for chemistry, machine learning and numerics applications
- API references

You will also find reading materials for quantum computing concepts on the documentation page. 

Don't forget, all of the quantum development documentations and samples are open-source. As a learner and quantum developer, you are encouraged to [contribute to the open-source quantum community](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/libraries/numerics/).
