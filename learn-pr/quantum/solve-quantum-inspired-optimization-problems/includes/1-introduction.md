In this module, you'll learn about quantum-inspired algorithms. In particular, you'll see how they can be applied to solve optimization problems, which is an area called quantum-inspired optimization (QIO). In this module, we'll look at Contoso Logistics Inc, a freight company that operates two container ships.

Contoso Logistics needs to distribute containers between the two ships as evenly as possible. If one ship is significantly heavier than the other, it will be slower and consume more fuel. The results are delayed shipments and significant cost increases. To make the problem harder, the weights of individual containers vary greatly so you can't just divide them between the two ships. How can you optimize the weight distribution of the containers?
