In this module, you'll learn about a *classical* computing method called quantum-inspired optimization (QIO). It refers to a class of algorithms inspired from quantum computing that are applied to solve optimization problems on traditional hardware. To illustrate this method, we'll look at Interplanet Express, a space freight company that specializes in mineral transports.

Your spaceship is transporting a rare mineral from a recently discovered asteroid in the Virgo cluster. Two competing galactic federations have laid claim to the asteroid, and we must avoid a political crisis at all costs. To resolve this conundrum, you organized two freight ships which must be loaded with the mineral as evenly as possible. To make the problem harder, the mineral is mined in massive chunks of various sizes, so you can't easily divide them between the ships. How can you optimize the distribution of the mineral and avert an intergalactic crisis?

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Learn about the origins of quantum-inspired optimization.
- See which kinds of problems are best suited to these techniques.
- Understand how algorithms inspired by physical processes are used to solve difficult problems.
- Solve a combinatorial optimization problem using the Azure Quantum optimization service.

## Prerequisites

1. The latest version of the [Azure Quantum Optimization SDK](//TODO: Link)
2. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
3. An Azure Quantum workspace

If you don't have these tools yet, we recommend that you follow the [How to create an Azure Quantum workspace](//TODO link) module first.
