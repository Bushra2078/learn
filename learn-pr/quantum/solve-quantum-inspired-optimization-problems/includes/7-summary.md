Phew! Luckily, an intergalactic crisis could be averted, thanks to your clever use of a QIO algorithm to equitably distribute the rare mineral.

You now have a basic understanding of QIO and some of the problems it can solve. Here's a brief recap:

* There are many types of quantum-inspired algorithms. One commonly used quantum-inspired algorithm is based on a computational model calledâ€¯*adiabatic quantum computing*.
* Today, we can emulate adiabatic quantum algorithms by using quantum-inspired techniques on classical hardware.
* QIO works best with problems where the landscape is rugged, with many hills and valleys.
* QIO can be used in Azure Quantum to solve optimization problems.

## Get started with quantum programming with Q\#

To get started with writing quantum programs, check out [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/?azure-portal=true). There, you'll build a basic program that measures qubits to generate random numbers.
