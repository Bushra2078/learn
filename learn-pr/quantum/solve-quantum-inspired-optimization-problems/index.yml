title: Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization
summary: Learn how quantum-inspired algorithms mimic quantum physics to solve difficult optimization problems.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll:
  - Learn about the origins of quantum-inspired algorithms.
  - See which kinds of problems are best suited to this method.
  - Understand how algorithms inspired by physical processes are used to solve difficult problems.
  - Solve a combinatorial optimization problem by using the Azure Quantum optimization service.
prerequisites: |
  - An Azure account with an active subscription. 
  - An Azure Quantum workspace with the **Microsoft QIO** provider enabled. 

  If you don't have these tools yet, we recommend that you begin with the [Get started with Azure Quantum](/training/modules/get-started-azure-quantum/?azure-portal=true) module.
