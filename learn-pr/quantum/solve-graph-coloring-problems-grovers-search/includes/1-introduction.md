Quantum computing promises to enable algorithms that are much faster than their classical counterparts for certain types of problems. This is one of the main reasons the space fleet wants to implement quantum computing, as it offers a computational speedup in certain problems. 

However, not all problems are suitable for quantum computers. Identifying the problems for which a quantum speedup is possible and coming up with algorithms that offer it is an area of ongoing research.

One such algorithm is *Grover's search algorithm* - one of the most famous in quantum computing. 
The problem it solves is often referred to as "searching a database", but it's more accurate to think of it as "search problem" or "inverting a function": that is, given a function $f(x)$ that returns 0 or 1, find any input $x_0$ for which the function returns 1: $f(x_0) = 1$. 
This formulation seems rather mathematical at first, but it's powerful enough to express a broad class of problems. 
The core idea of Grover's algorithm also turns out to be an important building block of other, more complex quantum algorithms.

Get ready! Your first real task is here! In this module, we'll introduce the necessary concepts and tools for implementing Grover's algorithm and applying it to solve a problem that has driven our interstellar communications division crazy - assign a bandwidth to each space station so communications don't interfere. Then you'll demonstrate the implementation in Q#.

Finally, we'll outline some practical aspects of using Grover's algorithm for solving problems.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 - Build _quantum oracles_ that implement classical functions on a quantum computer.
 - Explain the roles _superposition_, _interference_, and _entanglement_ play in building quantum algorithms.
 - Write a Q# program that uses Grover's algorithm to solve a graph coloring problem.
 - Recognize the kinds of problems for which Grover's algorithm can offer speedup compared to classical algorithms.
