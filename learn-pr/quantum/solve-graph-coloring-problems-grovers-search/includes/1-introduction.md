INTRODUCTION

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand the roles _interference_ and _entanglement_ play in building quantum algorithms.
- Define _inverse functions_ and learn how quantum _oracles_ help you build them.
- Create a Q# program that applies Grover's algorithm to a graph coloring problem.

## Prerequisites

- [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit?azure-portal=true)
