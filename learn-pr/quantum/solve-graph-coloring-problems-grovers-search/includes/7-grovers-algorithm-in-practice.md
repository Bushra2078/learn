Notes from outline:

Discussion of high-level algorithm properties:

* The algorithm is probabilistic, not deterministic (you need to verify the results you got)
* More iterations is not necessarily better (periodic behavior of result probability, optimal number of iterations to do before measuring)
* What to do if you don't know the number of iterations up front
