Congratulations! In this module, you've learned a lot about Grover's search - one of the most widely studied algorithms in quantum computing - and the steps necessary to apply it to a real-world problem.

* The first step is figuring out how to check whether a given set of values is a solution to the problem.
* Reversible computing techniques allow you to implement classical computations on a quantum computer. 
* Grover's algorithm uses quadratically fewer function evaluations compared to an exhaustive classical search.
* Implementing the algorithm and the oracle for graph coloring problem in Q# gave you plenty of practice in quantum programming! You learned multiple language features that make expressing quantum algorithms in Q# compact and readable, such as specialized control flow structures `within ... apply` and `repeat ... until` and the ability to pass operations as parameters to other operations.
* Using Grover's algorithm for solving practical problems is an open research topic. It includes methods for efficient implementation of quantum oracles, as well as identifying problems that can demonstrate a practical speedup.
