Choose the best response for each question. Then select "Check your answers."

Notes from outline:

TODO: come up with questions â€“ something like "what type of problem Grover search is going to be good for?"

(From Tom: try to think of questions that challenge the learner's understanding, not simply rote memorization. Just thinking out loud, but something like "Which of the following is a good candidate for Grover's algorithm?" Each alternative might briefly describe some type of problem. The explanation should defend why each answer is correct or incorrect.)
