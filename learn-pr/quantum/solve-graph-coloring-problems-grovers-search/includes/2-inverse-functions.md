Notes from outline:

Introduce the generic description of the problem posed by Grover's search (given function f, find input x such that f(x) = 1).

Talk about the types of problems that can be represented as function inversion: problems for which we can easily verify whether the given x is the answer, but we cannot easily exploit problem structure to find x. In this case, the best classical solution is to just try all inputs and see whether one of them fits. Let's see how quantum computing can help!

Describe the problem we're going to use in the module: graph coloring (more specifically vertex coloring), NP-complete problem. 

Visuals: graph to be colored, valid and invalid colorings (optional: map coloring example? Need to find a small enough real-world map, like in https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/examples/map_kerberos.html
