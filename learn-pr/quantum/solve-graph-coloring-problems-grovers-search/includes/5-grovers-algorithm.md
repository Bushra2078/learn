In the previous units we have introduced the search problem and learned to implement its instances as quantum oracles. 

In this unit we will learn Grover's algorithm for solving search problems.

Notes from outline:

Keep the description high-level â€“ we don't want to go into the circuit-level discussion.

Visuals:

1. Circle superposition diagram with "solutions" and "non-solutions" axis, two reflections that sum up to a rotation, a sequence of rotations that bring the state closer to the "solutions" (the latter would be animated)
1. Amplitudes diagram with amplitudes of various states changing during the phases of the algorithm (animated)

In the next unit we will see how to implement the algorithm we've just learned in Q#, and to run it to solve our graph coloring problem!
