Notes from outline:

Keep the description high-level â€“ we don't want to go into the circuit-level discussion.

Visuals:

1. Circle superposition diagram with "solutions" and "non-solutions" axis, two reflections that sum up to a rotation, a sequence of rotations that bring the state closer to the "solutions" (the latter would be animated)
1. Amplitudes diagram with amplitudes of various states changing during the phases of the algorithm (animated)
