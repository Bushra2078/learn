title: Solve graph coloring problems by using Grover's search
summary: Learn how Grover's algorithm can help you solve search problems such as graph coloring problems.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Understand the roles _interference_ and _entanglement_ play in building quantum algorithms.
  - Learn to build _quantum oracles_ to use in quantum search algorithm.
  - Create a Q# program that uses Grover's search algorithm to solve a graph coloring problem.
prerequisites: |
  - [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit?azure-portal=true)
