title: Solve graph coloring problems using Grover's search
summary: Learn how Grover's algorithm can help you solve search problems such as graph coloring problems.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  - Build _quantum oracles_ that implement classical functions on a quantum computer.
  - Explain the roles _superposition_, _interference_, and _entanglement_ play in building quantum algorithms.
  - Write a Q# program that uses Grover's search algorithm to solve a graph coloring problem.
  - Recognize the kinds of problems for which Grover's search algorithm can offer speedup compared to classical algorithms.
prerequisites: |
  - The latest version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download?azure-portal=true)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true)
  - The [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line?view=qsharp-preview&tabs=tabid-vscode?azure-portal=true)

  You will need basic knowledge of the principles of quantum computing: superposition, interference, entanglement, and measurement.

  You will also need some familiarity with Q# and the Quantum Development Kit.
