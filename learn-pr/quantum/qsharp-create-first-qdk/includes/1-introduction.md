Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

Whether you're a researcher or simply want to get a feel for what quantum programming is all about, this is a great place to start exploring Microsoft's approach to quantum computing.

In this module, you'll write your very first quantum program by using the Quantum Development Kit (QDK). The QDK enables you to write and test your quantum programs locally through a simulator, on standard hardware. You can later run the same quantum program on real quantum hardware through the Azure Quantum service.

The quantum program you'll write in this module generates random numbers. A random number generator is not only easy to write, but helps you understand the basics of quantum computing.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Prepare your development environment for writing quantum programs in Q#.
- Understand how Q# programs are structured.
- Work with qubits and superposition to build a quantum random number generator.
- Learn how Azure Quantum enables you to run your programs on real quantum hardware.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of quantum computing concepts.
