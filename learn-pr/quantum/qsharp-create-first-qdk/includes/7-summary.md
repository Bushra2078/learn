Congratulations, you have completed your first experience writing a Q# program
using the QDK. In this module you learned how to:

- prepare your development environment for writing quantum programs.
- use Q# to express quantum algorithms.
- create a simple quantum random bit generator.
- use the *Repeat Until Sucess* loop structure of Q# to create a quantum random
  number generator. 

## Learn more

You have started your journey as a quantum developer. Keep it up!

You can learn more about developing quantum algorithms from the [Microsoft Quantum Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/).

You will find information on: 

- [Quantum computing glossary](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/concepts/glossary).
- other step-by-step quickstarts for learning Q#
- more [code samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=qsharp) such as building a teleportation algorithm, doing a Grover search, running a CHSH game, etc.
- [quantum katas](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/intro-to-katas) for practicing quantum programming 
- information on the standard libraries, and libraries for chemistry, machine learning and numerics applications
- API references
- options for using Q# with C#, Python or Jupyter notebooks

You will also find reading materials for quantum computing concepts on the documentation page. 

For an example of use case of QDK by Microsoft's customers, check out this blog post on Microsoft Quantum's collaboration with Pacific Northwest Laboratory, [Simulating nature with the new Microsoft Quantum Development Kit chemistry library](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2018/12/04/simulating-nature-with-the-new-microsoft-quantum-development-kit-chemistry-library/).

Don't forget, all of the quantum development documentations and samples are open-source. As a learner and quantum developer, you are encouraged to [contribute to the open-source quantum community](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/libraries/numerics/).

These articles show how future advances in quantum computing can help researchers and industry solve todayâ€™s most pressing problems:
