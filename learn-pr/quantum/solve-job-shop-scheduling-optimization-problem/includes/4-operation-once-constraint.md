In this unit, the operation-once constraint will be defined, and you will learn how to represent it mathematically and then transform it to code.

The operation-once constraint is defined as follows:

| Constraint | Penalty condition |
|---|---|
|**Operation-once constraint**<br>Each operation is started once and only once.|Assign penalty if an operation isn't scheduled within the allowed time.<br>**Assumption:** if an operation starts, it runs to completion.|

### Worked example

Again, job 1 ($J_{1}$) will be used as an example:

- $J_{1}$: Recalibrate navigation system
  - $O_{2}$: Reboot the system (*2 minutes*)
  - $O_{3}$: Locate the three nearest stellar landmarks (*2 minutes*)

Recall the variable $x_{i,t}$:

$$\text{If } x_{i,t} = 1, \text{ } O_i\text{ starts at time } \textit{t}$$
$$\text{If } x_{i,t} = 0, \text{ } O_i\text{ does not start at time } \textit{t}$$

According to this constraint, $x_{i,t}$ for a specific operation should equal 1 **once and only once** from $t = 0 \rightarrow T - 1$ (because it should start once and only once during the allowed time).

So in this case, you need to assign a penalty if the sum of $x_{i,t}$ for each operation across all allowed times doesn’t equal exactly 1.

Let’s take $O_{2}$ as an example again:

|$t$|$x_{2,t}$|
|---|---|
|0|0|
|1|1|
|2|0|
|$\sum_t {x_{2,t}} =$|1|
|**Valid configuration?**|✔|

In the right-hand column, you see that $O_{2}$ starts at time 1 and no other time ($x_{2,t} = 1$ at time $t = 1$ and is $0$ otherwise). The sum of $x_{i,t}$ values over all $t$ for this example is therefore 1, which is what is expected! This is therefore a valid solution.

In the example below, you see an instance where $O_{2}$ is scheduled more than once ($x_{2,t} = 1$ more than once), in violation of the constraint:

|$t$|$x_{2,t}$|
|---|---|
|0|0|
|1|1|
|2|1|
|$\sum_t {x_{2,t}} =$|2|
|**Valid configuration?**|✘|

You can see from the above that $O_{2}$ has been scheduled to start at both time 1 and time 2, so the sum of $x_{2,t}$ values over all $t$ is now greater than 1. This violates the constraint and thus you must apply a penalty.

In the last example, you see an instance where $O_{2}$ has not been scheduled at all:

|$t$|$x_{2,t}$|
|---|---|
|0|0|
|1|0|
|2|0|
|$\sum_t {x_{2,t}} =$|0|
|**Valid configuration?**|✘|

In this example, none of the $x_{2,t}$ values equal 1 for any time step, meaning the operation is never scheduled. This means that the sum of $x_{2,t}$ values over all $t$ is 0 - the constraint is once again violated and you must allocate a penalty.

In summary:

|$t$|$x_{2,t}$|$x_{2,t}$|$x_{2,t}$|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0|
|1|1|1|0|
|2|0|1|0|
|$\sum_t {x_{2,t}} =$|1|2|0|
|**Valid configuration?**|✔|✘|✘|

Now that you understand when to assign penalties, let's formulate the constraint mathematically.

### Penalty formulation

As seen previously, you want to assign a penalty whenever the sum of $x_{i,t}$ values across all possible $t$ values is not equal to 1. This is how you represent that mathematically:

$$g(x) = \sum_{i} \left(\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1\right)^2.$$

Let's break that down:

- $\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1$

  As you saw in the sum row of the tables in the worked example, $\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}$ should always equal exactly 1 (meaning that an operation must be scheduled **once and only once** during the allowed time). This means that $\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1$ should always give 0. This means there is no penalty assigned when the constraint is not violated.
  
  In the case where $\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t} > 1$ (meaning an operation is scheduled to start more than once, like in the second example above), you now have a positive, non-zero penalty term as $\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1 > 0$.
  
  In the case where $\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t} = 0$ (meaning an operation is never scheduled to start, like in the last example above), you now have a $-1$ penalty term as $\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1$.


- $\left(\sum\dots\right)^2$

  Because the penalty terms must always be positive (otherwise you would be *reducing* the penalty when an operation isn't scheduled), you must square the result of $\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1$.
  
  This ensures that the penalty term is always positive (as $(-1)^2 = 1$).
  

- $\sum_{i} \left((\dots)^2\right)$

  Lastly, you must sum all penalties accumulated across all operations $O_{i}$ from all jobs.
  
To translate this constraint to code form, you are going to need to expand the quadratic equation in the sum.

To do this, you'll once again take $O_{2}$ as an example. You will set $T = 2$ so the $t$ values will be 0 and 1. The first step will be to substitute in our values:

$$\sum_{i} \left(\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1\right)^2 = \left(x_{2,0} + x_{2,1} - 1\right)^2$$

For simplicity, the $x_{2,t}$ variables will be renamed as follows:

$$x_{2,0} = x$$
$$x_{2,1} = y$$

Substituting these values in, you now have the following:

$$\sum_{i} \left(\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1\right)^2 = \left(x_{2,0} + x_{2,1} - 1\right)^2$$
$$=\left(x + y - 1\right)^2$$

Next, you need to expand out the bracket and multiply each term in the first bracket with all terms in the other bracket:

$$\sum_{i} \left(\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1\right)^2 = \left(x_{2,0} + x_{2,1} - 1\right)^2$$
$$= \left(x + y - 1\right)^2$$
$$= (x + y - 1)\cdot(x + y - 1)$$
$$= x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 2x - 2y + 1$$

The final step simplifies things a little. Because this is a binary optimization problem, $x$ and $y$ can only take the values of $0$ or $1$. Because of this, the following holds true:
$$x^2 = x$$
$$y^2 = y,$$

as
$$0^2 = 0$$
and
$$1^2 = 1$$

This means that the quadratic terms in the penalty function can combine with the two linear terms, giving the following formulation of the penalty function:
$$\sum_{i} \left(\left(\sum_{0\leq t < T} x_{i,t}\right) - 1\right)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 2x - 2y + 1 $$
$$= x + y + 2xy - 2x - 2y + 1 $$
$$= 2xy - x - y + 1 $$

If $T$ was larger, you would have more terms ($z$ and so on, for example).

### Code

You can now use this expanded version of the penalty function to build the penalty terms in code. Again, the coefficient (weight) term `c` is included, to be assigned a value later on:

```python
    # Reminder of the relevant parameters
    ## Time to allow for all jobs to complete
    T = 20 
    
    ## Assignment of operations to jobs (operation ID: job ID)
    ops_jobs_map = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2}

def operation_once_constraint(n: int, o: int, T:int, c:float):
    """

    terms = []

    # + 1 term
    terms.append(Term(c=c*1, indices=[]))
    
    return terms
```
