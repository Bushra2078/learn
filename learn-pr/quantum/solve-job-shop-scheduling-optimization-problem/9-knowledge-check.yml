  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which is the correct definition for the precedence constraint?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Each operation is started once and only once.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This is the operation once constraint.'
    - content: 'Jobs must take place in order.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Jobs are independent of one another (in the formulation used in this module) and thus operations in job 2 could be scheduled to start before those in job 1, as long as all the constraints are satisfied.'
    - content: 'Operations in a job must take place in order.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct! The precedence constraint ensures that operation i + 1 does not start before operation i finishes (assuming operations i and i + 1 belong to the same job).'
    - content: 'Machines can only do one thing at a time.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This is the no overlap constraint.'

  - content: 'Which of these scenarios violates the no overlap constraint? The scenario: operations 1 and 2 require the same machine. Operation 1 takes two time steps and operation 2 takes 1 time step.'
    choices:
    - content: 'Operation 1 starts at time t = 0, operation 2 starts at time t = 1.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct! Operation 2 starts only one time step after operation 1, even though operation 1 requires two time steps to complete.'
    - content: 'Operation 1 starts at time t = 0, operation 2 starts at time t = 2.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This scenario is valid: operation 2 starts two time steps after operation 1, allowing operation 1 to complete before the machine moves on to operation 2.'
    - content: 'Operation 1 starts at time t = 1, operation 2 starts at time t = 4.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This scenario is valid: operation 2 starts three time steps after operation 1, allowing operation 1 to complete before the machine moves on to operation 2.'
    - content: 'Operation 1 starts at time t = 2, operation 2 starts at time t = 4.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This scenario is valid: operation 2 starts two time steps after operation 1, allowing operation 1 to complete before the machine moves on to operation 2.'

  - content: 'Which of these scenarios is a valid solution? The bit strings shown indicate the x_i,t values for one operation, from t = 0 to t = 3.'
    choices:
    - content: '1 0 1 0'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'In this example, the operation is scheduled to start twice (x_i,t = 1 twice during the simulation).'
    - content: '0 0 0 0'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'In this example, the operation is never scheduled to start (x_i,t never equals 1).'
    - content: '1 0 1 1'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'In this example, the operation is scheduled to start three times (x_i,t = 1 three times during the simulation).'
    - content: '0 1 0 0'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct! The operation is scheduled to start once and only once during the simulation. This configuration therefore does not violate the operation once constraint (x_i,t = 1 once and only once).'
