Optimization problems are common in many industries, such as manufacturing, finance and transportation. To solve these problems, we search through all the feasible solutions to find the best solution, which is often the one with the lowest cost. Adiabatic quantum algorithms are well-suited to solving many optimization problems.

In the future, adiabatic quantum algorithms will run on quantum computers, once we have large-scale, high-quality devices. Today, we can emulate these algorithms by using quantum-inspired techniques on classical hardware. These techniques often perform better than state-of-the-art classical optimization techniques.

Applying QIO to real-world problems may offer businesses new insights or help lower costs by making their processes more efficient. QIO is well-suited for these types of scenarios.

- It can find the solution faster than other optimization techniques for a fixed use case and fixed quality of solution.
- It can find a higher quality solution that other optimization techniques for a fixed problem and fixed amount of time.
- It can use a more realistic model than other optimization techniques by extending the problem to consider more variables.
