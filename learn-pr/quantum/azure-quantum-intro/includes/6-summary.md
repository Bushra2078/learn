Congratulations! You have completed the overview of Azure Quantum. In this module, you learned about:

- the types of problems Azure Quantum service can help you solve
- the software and hardware systems you can use through Azure Quantum
- quantum-inspired optimization supported by Azure Quantum via its solvers

## Learn more about QIO
- Learn more about adiabatic quantum computation at [Adiabatic quantum computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation)
- You can learn more about building a scalable quantum computer in [this blog post](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2018/05/16/achieving-scalability-in-quantum-computing/)
- [Theory suggests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01659.pdf) we'll see further speedups once quantum hardware is available
- [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)
- Here's an example of a good use of QIO: [previously used methods](https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/quantum-computing-mri-cancer-treatment/)
Learn more about simulated annealing at: [Simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)

## Learn more about Azure Quantum

Azure Quantum is currently under private preview. You can request early access to Azure Quantum by filling out a form on the [Microsoft Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/quantum/#contact). Stay tuned for information about the public release.

The ship loading problem is a simple problem to demostrate QIO. There are many problems that can be expressed in quantum-inspired techniques. To learn more about use cases where Microsoft's customers leveraged Azure Quantum and QIO for their industry solutions, check out the following blogs:
