Azure Quantum is a cloud service that allows you to run Quantum Programs and solve Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QIO) problems in the cloud. Azure Quantum takes these jobs and schedules them with the desired provider for execution. Using our SDKs and tools you can easily run a job against multiple providers and targets to find the one that will work best for your scenario.

In this module, you'll learn what Azure Quantum is and how it can be used to solve your quantum computing or quantum-inspired projects at scale.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Understand the types of problems Azure Quantum service can help you solve
- Understand the process of creating a project on Azure Quantum portal
- Learn about quantum-inspired optimization 
- Learn about the hardware systems you can use through Azure Quantum

## Prerequisites

- An introductory knowledge of Quantum Computing
- An introductory knowledge of Microsoft Azure 

## Learn the scenario

(come up with a story related to the QIO example) e.g. Suppose you manage a research department of a pharmaceutical company, that is working on the vaccination against the latest influenzas. Your company has been delivering drugs around the world and prioritizes its business on researching on chemicals that can defend against the ever evolving viruses.
