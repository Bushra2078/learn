Azure Quantum is a cloud service that extends the scalability, security and reliability of Azure into the quantum computing world, providing access to a diverse set of quantum services, ranging from pre-built solutionsÂ to software and quantum hardware. 
Built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, Azure Quantum enables you to begin exploring and building applications today.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:
- Learn about the services and tools available through Azure Quantum
- Discover the process of creating a workspace in the Azure Quantum portal
- Learn how quantum programs can be executed in the cloud
- Learn about optimization and evaluate situations where quantum-inspired solutions can have impact

## Prerequisites

- An introductory knowledge of Quantum Computing
- An introductory knowledge of Microsoft Azure 

## Learn the scenario

![Contoso Logistics](../media/contoso.png)

Contoso Logistics Inc is a world class freight company operating a fleet of large container ships. 
When these ships are docked at port, Contoso Logistics needs to distribute containers between the two ships as evenly as possible. 
If they make one ship significantly heavier than the other then it will move slower and consume more fuel - delaying shipments and costing a significant amount of money! If you were managing the distribution containers for Contoso, how would you optimize the weights?
To make things harder, the weights of individual containers can vary greatly so it's not easy to divide them.

This problem is known as a number partitioning problem and we can use quantum inspired optimization (QIO) to generate a good solution.
In this module, we'll explore how to apply QIO via the Azure Quantum cloud service.

## What you will do in this module

In the following units you will go through these steps:

- Watch a short video introduction to the Azure Quantum service and the solutions it provides
- Learn about how to use Azure Quantum to run quantum algorithms on hardware 
- Learn about quantum-inspired optimization (QIO) solvers enabled by Azure Quantum
