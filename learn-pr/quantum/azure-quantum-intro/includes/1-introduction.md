In this module, you’ll learn about quantum-inspired optimization (QIO). You'll apply what you've learned to solve this  actual optimization problem.

**TODO:** We need to decide whether its "quantum-inspired optimization", "quantum inspired optimization", or "Quantum Inspired Optimization". The choice largely depends on how marketing brands it.

Contoso Logistics Inc. is a freight company that operates two container ships.

Contoso Logistics needs to distribute containers between the two ships as evenly as possible. If one ship is significantly heavier than the other it will be slower and consume more fuel. The results are delayed shipments and significant cost increases. To make the problem harder, the weights of individual containers vary greatly so you can’t simply divide them between the two ships. How can you optimize the weight distribution of the containers?

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Learn how QIO emulates quantum algorithms on classical hardware. **Kitty:** We do mention several times that it is running on classical hardware. But we don't actually explain how.
- See which kinds of problems are best suited to QIO.
- Understand how QIO applies quantum techniques to solve optimization problems.
- Apply QIO to a real-world optimization problem.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of quantum computing
