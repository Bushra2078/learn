Azure Quantum is a cloud service that allows you to run Quantum Programs and solve Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QIO) problems in the cloud. Azure Quantum takes these jobs and schedules them with the desired provider for execution. Using our SDKs and tools you can easily run a job against multiple providers and targets to find the one that will work best for your scenario.

In this module, you'll learn what Azure Quantum is and how it can be used to solve your quantum computing or quantum-inspired projects at scale.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Understand the types of problems Azure Quantum service can help you solve
- Understand the process of creating a project on Azure Quantum portal
- Learn about quantum-inspired optimization 
- Learn about the hardware systems you can use through Azure Quantum

## Prerequisites

- An introductory knowledge of Quantum Computing
- An introductory knowledge of Microsoft Azure 

## Learn the scenario

Contoso Logistics Inc is a world class freight company operating a fleet of large container ships. 
When these ships are docked at port, Contoso Logistics needs to distribute containers between the two ships as evenly as possible. 
If they make one ship significantly heavier than the other then it will move slower and consume more fuel - delaying shipments and costing a significant amount of money! If you were managing the distribution containers for Contoso, how would you optimize the weights?
To make things harder, the weights of individual containers can vary greatly so it's not easy to divide them.

This problem is known as a number partitioning problem and is NP-complete. 
It is however relatively straightforward to apply Quantum Inspired Optimization (QIO) to it to generate a good solution.
QIO is supported via the Azure Quantum cloud service. In this module, we'll explore how to apply QIO.

## What you will do in this module

In the following units you will go through these steps:

- Watch a short video introduction to the Azure Quantum service and the solutions it provides
- Learn about how to use Azure Quantum to run quantum algorithms on hardware 
- Learn about quantum-inspired optimization (QIO) solvers enabled by Azure Quantum
