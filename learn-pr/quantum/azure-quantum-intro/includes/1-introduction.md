In this module, you’ll learn about quantum-inspired optimization (QIO). You'll apply what you've learned to solve this real-world optimization problem.

Contoso Logistics Inc. is a freight company that operates two container ships.

Contoso Logistics needs to distribute containers between the two ships as evenly as possible. If one ship is significantly heavier than the other it will be slower and consume more fuel. The results are delayed shipments and significant cost increases. To make the problem harder, the weights of individual containers vary greatly so you can’t simply divide them between the two ships. How can you optimize the weight distribution of the containers?
