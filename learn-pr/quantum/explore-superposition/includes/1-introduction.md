Quantum mechanics introduces concepts that challenge our classical understanding of physics, such as the principle of superposition, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This foundational idea is crucial for grasping the behavior of qubits in quantum computing, which operate under different rules than traditional bits.

In this module, you'll explore qubits and superposition in the Bloch sphere, a geometric representation of qubit states. 

You'll learn how to manipulate qubits using Q# and the Azure Quantum Development Kit.
