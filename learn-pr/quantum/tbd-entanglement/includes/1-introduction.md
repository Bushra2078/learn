Quantum computers are presumably faster than classical computers for certain 
tasks. Some quantum algorithms, like integer factorization, offer exponential
speed ups against their classical counterparts. But, why? How does quantum
computing differ from classical computing and how is it related with more
powerful devices?

In this module we will introduce some fundamental concepts of quantum computing
like superposition, entanglement and interference. We will make use of Q# and
different tools of the Quantum Development Kit to illustrate these ideas.

Finally, we will wrap-up all these concepts to implement the Deutschâ€“Jozsa
quantum algorithm to show how they can be exploited to outperform classical
computers.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Learn the basic theory behind the power of quantum computing: superposition,
  entanglement and interference.
- Get a firsthand view of different tools of the Quantum Development Kit like
  the DumpMachine function and the Resources Estimator.
- Demonstrate the power of quantum computing by implementing in Q# a quantum
  algorithm that outperforms any classical algorithm.
