Quantum computers work in fundamentally different ways from classical computers. They can offer solutions when classical computers run into limitations. Quantum algorithms is not always faster than their classical counterparts. But for certain tasks, such as factorizing large numbers or searching for items in an unordered list, quantum computers prove to provide exponential speed-ups. How does it work?

The key to understanding quantum computing is the three concepts: superposition, entanglement and interference. In this module, we will explain these fundamentals. We will use Q# and tools provided by the Quantum Development Kit to illustrate these ideas.

Finally, we will wrap-up all these concepts to implement the Deutschâ€“Jozsa
quantum algorithm to show how they can be exploited to outperform classical
computers.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Learn the basic theory behind the power of quantum computing: superposition,
  entanglement and interference.
- Get a firsthand view of different tools of the Quantum Development Kit like
  the DumpMachine function and the Resources Estimator.
- Demonstrate the power of quantum computing by implementing in Q# a quantum
  algorithm that outperforms any classical algorithm.
