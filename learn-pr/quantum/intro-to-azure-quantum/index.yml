title: Introduction to quantum computing with Azure Quantum
summary: What makes quantum computing so special? And how can you run quantum algorithms on real quantum computers from your own home? Quantum computers introduce new concepts to traditional programming methods by using the special rules of quantum physics to do calculations. Learn about the qubit, and the building block of a quantum computer. See how Azure Quantum and the Quantum Development Kit can help you write quantum algorithms using Q#, a quantum programming language. Then, you can run your programs in real quantum computers thanks to the Azure Quantum service.
