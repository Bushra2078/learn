title: Introduction to quantum computing with Azure Quantum
summary: Quantum computing has become a hot topic in the last few years. Learn about the qubit, and the building block of a quantum computer. See how Azure Quantum and the Quantum Development Kit can help you write quantum algorithms usign Q#, a quantum programming language. Then, you can run your programs in real quantum computers thanks to the Azure Quantum service.
