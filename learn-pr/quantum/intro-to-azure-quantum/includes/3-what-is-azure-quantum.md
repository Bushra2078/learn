[Azure Quantum](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/quantum/) is the cloud quantum computing service of Azure. It offers a wide range of quantum hardware, software, and solutions in a single cloud service.

With Azure Quantum, you can write code once and run it with little to no change against multiple targets of the same family - or you can adapt the same algorithm for specific systems.

## What's included on Azure Quantum?

With Azure Quantum and the Quantum Development Kit, you're able to program your quantum algorithms, then apply those quantum solutions within the existing Azure platform.

### Quantum Development Kit

Quantum programming is a distinct art from classical programming requiring very different tools to understand and express quantum algorithmic thinking. The Quantum Development Kit (QDK) is the software development kit required to interface with the Azure Quantum service. With the Quantum Development Kit, you can build programs that run on quantum hardware in Azure Quantum.

The QDK includes Q#, a high-level **quantum programming language**. Q# is designed to address the challenges of quantum information processing; it is integrated in a software stack that enables a quantum algorithm to be compiled down to the primitive operations of a quantum computer.

The Quantum Development Kit is designed to be used by a broad range of developers, from experienced quantum experts to developers who have never written a line of quantum code. It is built into the Azure Quantum portal, where you can develop programs using the free hosted Azure Notebooks. You can also install the QDK extension for VS Code on your computer to use your own local development environment and work both online and offline with the Azure Quantum service.

### Resource estimation

In quantum computing, resource estimation is the ability to understand the resources, that is, the number of qubits, number of quantum gates, processing time, etc., that will be required to run your algorithm. Understanding the number of qubits required for a quantum solution and the differences between qubit technologies allows innovators to prepare and refine their quantum solutions to run on future scaled quantum machines and ultimately accelerate their quantum impact.

Azure Quantum provides a tool for estimating the resources of your quantum program. The Azure Quantum Resource Estimator allows you to assess architectural decisions, compare qubit technologies, and determine the resources needed to execute a given quantum algorithm. You can choose from predefined fault-tolerant protocols and specify assumptions of the underlying physical qubit model.

The Azure Quantum Resource Estimator computes post-layout physical resource estimation by taking a set of inputs such as qubit architecture, a quantum error correction (QEC) code, an error budget, and other parameters into account.

If you want to know more, check the module [Estimate physical resources for quantum algorithms by using the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator](/training/modules/estimate-resources-quantum-algorithms).

### Quantum hardware

In Azure Quantum, you can find various quantum hardware providers to help you get ready for the future of scaled quantum machines. Unlike other solutions, you're not siloed to a single hardware technology, and you benefit from a full stack approach protecting your long-term investments.

- **IonQ:** Dynamically reconfigurable trapped-ion quantum computers for up to 11 fully connected qubits, that lets you run a two-qubit gate between any pair.
- **Quantinuum:** Trapped-ion systems with high-fidelity, fully connected qubits, low error rates, qubit reuse, and the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements.
- **Rigetti:** Gate-based superconducting processors based on tunable qubits. Their latest Aspen-M family processor is based on proprietary scalable multi-chip technology, enabling low latency and parallel execution.

### Free Azure Quantum Credits

If this is your first time using Azure Quantum, you automatically get free **$500 (USD)** Azure Quantum Credits for use with each participating quantum hardware provider. That's right, you have $500 (USD) to spend at each of the quantum providers. The Azure Quantum Credits facilitate your exploration of the different quantum providers and help you test your first quantum programs.

Azure Quantum Credits consumption is based on a resource-usage model defined by each quantum provider and cost of use is deducted from your credits.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that Azure credits and Azure Quantum credits are different grants and shouldn't be confused. When you create a [free trial Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), you get $200 (USD) free Azure Credits to use on Azure services. Azure credits aren't eligible to use on quantum hardware providers.

## Job lifecycle in Azure Quantum

Once you've written your quantum program, you can select a target and submit your program, also called a job.

This diagram shows the basic workflow after you submit your job:

First, Azure Quantum uploads the job to the Azure Storage account that you configured in the workspace. Then, the job is added to the job queue for the provider that you specified in the job. Azure Quantum then downloads your program and translates it for the provider. The provider processes the job and returns the output to Azure Storage, where it is available for download.

## If I'm not a quantum expert, can I still use Azure Quantum?

Microsoft is committed to making quantum computing accessible to everyone, whether you're a quantum developer, researcher, or enthusiast.

Azure Quantum has incorporated **artificial intelligence** to assist you. You can play with the Copilot in Azure Quantum, a quantum-focused chatbot that helps you write code and better understand concepts.

If you want to learn by doing, Azure Quantum provides the *Quantum Katas*, a series of self-paced tutorials that teach you elements of quantum computing and Q# programming at the same time. You can also check [the Q# quantum samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/tree/main/samples/azure-quantum).

You can also learn from experts and enthusiasts through blogs, articles and videos. And you can try out some Q# code samples in the online code editor.

All these tools are **free of charge**.
