title: Use the Q# libraries
summary: Learn about libraries in Q# and how to add them to your projects, discover the Q# API documentation, implement another application of Grover's algorithm by using the standard library, and write documentation for your own code.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Learn about libraries in Q#, specifically how they're distributed and how to add them to your projects.
  - Use the Q# standard library to express quantum algorithms at a high level.
  - Get to know the API documentation and integrated help capabilities to more efficiently find and use Q# functionality.
  - Write API documentation comments to help document and explain your Q# programs.
prerequisites: |
  - A basic understanding of how Grover's algorithm works. For an introductory tutorial, see [Implement Grover's search algorithm in Q#](azure/quantum/tutorial-qdk-grovers-search?azure-portal=true).
  - A functioning QDK environment and ability to create a Q# project in Visual Studio Code as described in [Install the QDK for Visual Studio Code](../../../quantum/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/includes/2-install-quantum-development-kit-code.md?azure-portal=true).
