title: Use the Q# libraries
summary: Learn about libraries in Q# and how to add them to your projects, discover the Q# API documentation, implement another application of Grover's algorithm by using the standard library, and write documentation for your own code.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Learn about libraries in Q#, specifically how they're distributed and how to add them to your projects.
  - Use the Q# standard library to express quantum algorithms at a high level.
  - Get to know the API documentation and integrated help capabilities to more efficiently find and use Q# functionality.
  - Write API documentation comments to help document and explain your Q# programs.
prerequisites: |
  - A basic understanding of how Grover's algorithm works. If you completed the prior module, [Solving graph coloring problems using Grover's search](/training/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search?azure-portal=true), you're all set. Otherwise, you can find the overview in the [Grover's search algorithm](/training/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/5-grovers-algorithm?azure-portal=true) unit of that module.
  - A functioning QDK environment in [Visual Studio Code for command-line applications](/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line?tabs=tabid-vscode&azure-portal=true).
