title: Use the Q# libraries
summary: Learn about libraries in Q# and how to add them to your projects, discover the Q# API documentation, implement another application of Grover's algorithm using the Standard library, and write documentation for your own code.
abstract: |
  In this module you will:
  - Learn about libraries in Q#, specifically how they are distributed and how to add them to your projects
  - Use the Q# Standard Library to express quantum algorithms at a high level
  - Get to know the API documentation and integrated help capabilities to more efficiently find and use Q# functionality
  - Write API documentation comments to help document and explain your Q# programs
prerequisites: |
  - A basic understanding of how Grover's algorithm works. If you completed the prior module, [Solving graph coloring problems using Grover's search](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/), you are all set, but otherwise the overview can be found at the [Grover Search Algorithm unit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/5-grovers-algorithm) therein.
  - A functioning QDK environment, preferably in [VS Code for command-line applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line?tabs=tabid-vscode) or in [Q# Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/install-jupyter?tabs=tabid-conda).
