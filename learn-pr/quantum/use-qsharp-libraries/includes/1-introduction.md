Q# provides you with an increasing number of libraries that will help you use existing functionalities to create advanced quantum algorithms.

In previous modules, you learned how to use the basic features of the [Quantum Development Kit](/training/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/2-install-quantum-development-kit-code?azure-portal=true) for solving tasks of your space mission. Now, you desperately need a book on how to grow potatoes in outer space. The intergalactic online library only lets you search for books by International Standard Book Number (ISBN). You had written that number down on a sticky note, but after spilling your coffee while the spaceship went through an asteroid field, one of the digits is now illegible.

By implementing Grover's algorithm with the Q# standard library, you'll determine the missing digit and save your space garden.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn about libraries in Q#, specifically how they're distributed and how to add them to your projects.
- Use the Q# standard library to express quantum algorithms at a high level.
- Get to know the API documentation and integrated help capabilities to more efficiently find and use Q# functionality.
- Write API documentation comments to help document and explain your Q# programs.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of how Grover's algorithm works. For an introductory tutorial, see [Implement Grover's search algorithm in Q#](/azure/quantum/tutorial-qdk-grovers-search?azure-portal=true).
- A functioning QDK environment and ability to create a Q# project in Visual Studio Code as described in [Install the QDK for Visual Studio Code](/training/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/2-install-quantum-development-kit-code?azure-portal=true).
