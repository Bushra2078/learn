In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

* The QDK includes multiple Q# libraries: the standard library and domain-specific libraries for numerics, chemistry, and machine learning. New Q# projects have access to the standard library by default. Using the others requires explicitly adding them to the project.
* Q# libraries, both from the QDK and from third-party developers, are distributed as NuGet packages and added to Q# projects in the same way.
* The API reference documentation is an invaluable tool for developing with the QDK, so be sure to take advantage of it.
* Documenting your own code can help not only others but also yourself through editor assistance in Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebooks.

* If you haven't yet completed it, you can see another application of Grover's algorithm in the [Solving graph coloring problems by using Grover's search](/training/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search?azure-portal=true) module.
* In addition to the API reference documentation, you can find conceptual information and further learning resources in the [Microsoft Quantum documentation](/quantum?azure-portal=true).
* The Q# libraries source code is primarily located in the [microsoft/QuantumLibraries](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries?azure-portal=true) repository on GitHub. Some parts are in the [microsoft/qsharp-runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime?azure-portal=true) and [microsoft/quantum-nc](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-nc?azure-portal=true) repositories.
