In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

* The QDK includes multiple Q# libraries: the standard library as well as domain-specific libraries for numerics, chemistry, and machine-learning. New Q# projects have access to the standard library by default, whereas using the others requires explicitly adding them to the project.
* Q# libraries, both from the QDK and third-party developers, are distributed as NuGet packages and added to Q# projects in the same manner.
* The API reference documentation is an invaluable tool when developing with the QDK, be sure to take advantage of it.
* Documenting your own code can help not only others but also yourself through editor assistance in Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebooks.

* If you haven't yet completed it, you can see another application of Grover's algorithm in the module on [Solving graph coloring problems using Grover's search](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search?azure-portal=true).
* In addition to the API reference documentation, you can find conceptual documentation and further learning resources at the [Microsoft Quantum Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum?azure-portal=true).
* The source code of the Q# libraries is primarily located in the [microsoft/QuantumLibraries](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries?azure-portal=true) repository on GitHub, with some parts contained in the [microsoft/qsharp-runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime?azure-portal=true) and [microsoft/quantum-nc](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-nc?azure-portal=true) repositories.
