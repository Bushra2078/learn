Now that you understand some of the basics, it's your turn to build a small quantum program. 

Before using quantum computers to solve decisive problems, the captain of the space fleet has command to implement quantum physics in our system as a test. Your first task consists of improving current security protocols. 

Humans may have good diplomatic relations, but we need to take care of invaders and space pirates. Good relations donâ€™t mean not to be careful! Every member of the space fleet has a personal and non-transferable password. These passwords change every hour thanks to a random number generator (RNG) to ensure security.

You're likely already familiar with the concept of a random number generator (RNG). On classical computers, most RNG don't produce truly random numbers, but rather _pseudorandom_ numbers. A pseudorandom number generator generates the same sequence of numbers based on some initial value, called a _seed_. 

We say it is pseudorandom because after a certain number of iterations, called _period_, the RNG returns the seed and the same sequence of numbers starts all over again. To better approximate random values, this seed is often the current time from the CPU's clock.

You would like to use truly random numbers so no galactic hacker can find out the sequence of random numbers and thus, jeopardize space fleet security. To do so you need to build a quantum random number generator (QRNG). With a quantum random number generator, passwords will be truly random and unbreakable. 

A QRNG is a perfect introduction to quantum computing because it illustrates quantum behavior and requires only a few lines of code.

You start by taking a qubit in a classical state, for example zero, as seed. The first step of the QRNG is to use an `H` operation to put the qubit \ket{0}$ into superposition. The measurement of this state results in a bit zero or a one with equal 50% probability each one. The value of this bit is truly random, there is no way of knowing what you will get after the measurement. But how can you use this behavior to generate larger numbers to use as a valid password?

Let's say you run your QRNG four times, generating this sequence of binary digits:

$${0, 1, 1, 0}$$

If you concatenate, or combine, these bits into a bit string, you can form a decimal number. In this example, the bit sequence ${0110}$ is equivalent to six in decimal.

$${0110_{\ binary} \equiv 6_{\ decimal}}$$

If you repeat this process many times you can combine multiple bits to form any large number. Now you can provide your superior with that number as a seccure password since you can be sure that no space hacker could determine the results of the sequence of measurements. 

You build out your quantum random number generator in two phases. In this chapter, you build out the first phase, which is to generate a single random bit.

To do so, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a Q# project.
> * Add code that uses the `H` operation to put a qubit into superposition and then measure its value.
> * Run the program.

In the next chapter, you build out the second phase, which combines random bits to form a larger number.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that because you're using the simulator to run your Q# program, you still get pseudorandom results. But after you verify your program through the simulator, you can run the same program on a quantum computer to get truly random results that measure fundamental physical processes.

## Create the Q# project

Here, you create a Q# project just like you did earlier.

1. On the **View** menu, select **Command Palette**.
1. Enter **Q#: Create New Project**.
1. Select **Standalone console application**.
1. Select a directory to hold your project, such as your home directory. Enter *QuantumRNG* as the project name, then select **Create Project**.
1. From the window that appears at the bottom, select **Open new project**.

    Like before, you see two files: the project file and *Program.qs*, which contains starter code.

## Include the Measurement library

To measure a qubit, you use the [M](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.m?azure-portal=true) operation. After you measure a qubit, you need to use the [Reset](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.reset?azure-portal=true) operation to place the qubit back in the zero state. The `Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic` library provides both of these operations.

To simplify the process, you can use the [MResetZ](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.measurement.mresetz?azure-portal=true) operation. This operation combines `M` and `Reset` as one operation.

The `Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement` library provides the `MResetZ` operation. Let's add that library now.

1. In Visual Studio, open *Program.qs*.
1. Near the top of the file, add this `open` directive:

    [!code-qsharp[](code/4-program-1.qs?highlight=5)]

## Define the GenerateRandomBit operation

Recall that in the *QuantumHello* program, you defined the `HelloQ` operation like this:

```qsharp
operation HelloQ() : Unit {
    Message("Hello quantum world!");
}
```

Compare that with the operation below. You define the `GenerateRandomBit` operation. This operation takes no input and produces a value of type `Result`. The `Result` type represents the result of a measurement and can have two possible values: `Zero` and `One`.

To define the operation:

1. Replace the contents of *Program.qs* with this:

    [!code-qsharp[](code/4-program-2.qs?highlight=7-9)]

    `EntryPoint` tells the Q# compiler that this is where to begin execution of the program.

1. Add this code to the `GenerateRandomBit` operation:

    [!code-qsharp[](code/4-program-3.qs?highlight=9-16)]

    Recall that you allocate qubits through the `using` keyword.

    The `H` operation places the qubit in superposition. The `MResetZ` operation measures the qubit, resets the qubit to the zero state, and returns the measured value (a zero or a one).

## Run the program

Let's try out your random bit generator. To do so:

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to the terminal. If you closed the terminal, on the **View** menu, select **Terminal** or **Integrated Terminal**.
1. Run `dotnet run`.

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    You see either "Zero" or "One" in the output. Here's an example:

    ```output
    Zero
    ```
1. Run the program again. This time, you can skip the build phase by using the `--no-build` flag.

    ```bash
    dotnet run --no-build
    ```

    Again, you see either "Zero" or "One" in the output:

    ```output
    One
    ```

Next, you'll implement the second phase of your quantum random number generator: combining multiple random bits to form a larger number.

Leave your project open in Visual Studio Code for the next part.
