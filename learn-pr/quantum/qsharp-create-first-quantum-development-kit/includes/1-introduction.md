In this module, you'll write your first quantum program by using the Quantum Development Kit (QDK). The QDK enables you to write and test your quantum programs locally, with a simulator, on standard hardware. You can, when it's g

In this module, you'll write a quantum program to generate random numbers. A quantum random number generator is a perfect introduction to quantum computing because it illustrates quantum behavior and requires only a few lines of code.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Create a Q# program in Visual Studio Code.
- Understand how Q# programs are structured.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of quantum computing concepts.
- Basic knowledge of classical programming concepts.
- The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or open [VS Code on the Web](https://vscode.dev/).
