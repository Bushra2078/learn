Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

Whether you're a developer or simply someone who wants to get a feel for what quantum programming is all about, this module is a great place to start exploring.

In this module, you'll write your first quantum program by using the Quantum Development Kit (QDK). The QDK enables you to write and test your quantum programs locally. You use a simulator and standard hardware. When the Azure Quantum service is generally available, you can run the same quantum program on quantum hardware.

The quantum program that you write in this module generates random numbers. A random number generator is easy to write, and it will help you understand the basics of quantum computing.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Prepare your development environment for writing quantum programs in Q#.
- Understand how Q# programs are structured.
- Work with qubits and superposition to build a quantum random-number generator.
- Learn how Azure Quantum enables you to run your programs on quantum hardware.
