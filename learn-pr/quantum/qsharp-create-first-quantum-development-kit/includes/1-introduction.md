Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

Whether you're a developer or simply someone who wants to get a feel for what quantum programming is all about, this is a great place to start exploring quantum computing.

In this module, you'll write your very first quantum program by using the Quantum Development Kit (QDK). The QDK enables you to write and test your quantum programs locally, with a simulator, on standard hardware. You can, when it's generally available, run the same quantum program on quantum computers through the Azure Quantum service.

The quantum program you'll write in this module generates random numbers. A random number generator is not only easy to write, but it will help you understand the basics of quantum computing.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Prepare your development environment for writing quantum programs in Q#.
- Understand how Q# programs are structured.
- Work with qubits and superposition to build a quantum random number generator.
- Learn how Azure Quantum enables you to run your programs on quantum computers.
