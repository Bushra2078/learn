Welcome aboard your spaceship!

In this module, you'll write your first quantum program by using the Quantum Development Kit (QDK). The QDK enables you to write and test your quantum programs locally, with a simulator, on standard hardware. You can, when it's generally available, run the same quantum program on quantum hardware through the Azure Quantum service.

The first thing you'll do before using your quantum computer is to sign in to the system. You want to generate a truly random password so no galactic hacker can jeopardize space fleet security.

In this module, you'll write a quantum program to generate random numbers. A random number generator is not only easy to write, but it will help you understand the basics of quantum computing.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Prepare your development environment for writing quantum programs in Q#.
- Understand how Q# programs are structured.
- Work with qubits and superposition to build a quantum random number generator.
- Learn how Azure Quantum enables you to run your programs on quantum hardware.
