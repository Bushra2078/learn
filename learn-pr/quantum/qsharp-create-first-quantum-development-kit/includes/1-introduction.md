Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

Whether you're a developer or simply someone who wants to get a feel for what quantum programming is all about, this is a great place to start exploring quantum computing.

You won’t be alone in this journey. We will instruct you step by step through each of the different modules. 

To make this process a bit more entertaining, you will immerse yourself into a space adventure. As part of a quantum space exploration team, you will face challenges to test your quantum skills.

It is a long time since the first spacecraft left the earth in search of a better life in a new planet. After many years of exploration and survival in the galaxy, human race has developed good interplanetary relations and a trade alliance with other species. We are doing right, but it is time to take it to the next level. 

With the use of quantum computers, our communications will be more secure, and we may be able to solve problems such as establishing the best trade route, identifying the best molecule for a new fuel, or break enemy’s security protocols down.

In this module, you'll write your very first quantum program by using the Quantum Development Kit (QDK). The QDK enables you to write and test your quantum programs locally, with a simulator, on standard hardware. You can, when it's generally available, run the same quantum program on quantum hardware through the Azure Quantum service.

Of course, the first thing you will do before using your quantum computer is logging into it. You would like to use a randomized password so no galactic hacker can jeopardize space fleet security. You will write a quantum program in this module to generate random numbers. A random number generator is not only easy to write, but it will help you understand the basics of quantum computing.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Prepare your development environment for writing quantum programs in Q#.
- Understand how Q# programs are structured.
- Work with qubits and superposition to build a quantum random number generator.
- Learn how Azure Quantum enables you to run your programs on quantum hardware.
