  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which of these statements is true about the random number generator that you built in this module?'
    choices:
    - content: 'You always get truly random numbers, both in the simulator and on quantum hardware.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'A quantum computer can produce truly random numbers. Although the simulator produces pseudorandom numbers, you can use it to test and verify your algorithms.'
    - content: 'You never get truly random numbers. You get only pseudorandom numbers.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'A quantum computer can produce truly random numbers. The simulator produces pseudorandom numbers.'
    - content: 'In the simulator, you get pseudorandom numbers. On a quantum computer, you get truly random numbers.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Although the simulator produces pseudorandom numbers, you can use it to test and verify your algorithms.'
