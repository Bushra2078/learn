  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which of these statements is true about the random number generator that you built in this module?'
    choices:
    - content: 'You always get truly random numbers, both in the simulator and on quantum hardware.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'A quantum computer can produce truly random numbers. Although the simulator produces pseudorandom numbers, you can use it to test and verify your algorithms.'
    - content: 'You never get truly random numbers. You get only pseudorandom numbers.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'A quantum computer can produce truly random numbers. The simulator produces pseudorandom numbers.'
    - content: 'In the simulator, you get pseudorandom numbers. On a quantum computer, you get truly random numbers.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Although the simulator produces pseudorandom numbers, you can use it to test and verify your algorithms.'

  - content: 'Which of the following structures are required in a Q# program to run successfully?'
    choices:
    - content: 'A Q# program must have a namespace, an operation, and a function.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A function is not required in a Q# program."
    - content: "A Q# program must have a namespace, an entry point, and an operation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Every Q# program must have a namespace, and an `EntryPoint` followed by an operation so the Q# compiler knows where to start the program."
    - content: "A Q# program must have a namespace, an entry point, an operation and at least one qubit allocated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can write Q# programs that don't need to perform operations on a qubit. A Q# program without a qubit allocated can run successfully."
