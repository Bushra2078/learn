Azure Quantum is a cloud service that allows you to run Quantum Programs and solve Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QIO) problems in the cloud. Azure Quantum takes these jobs and schedules them with the desired provider for execution. Using our SDKs and tools you can easily run a job against multiple providers and targets to find the one that will work best for your scenario.

In this module, you'll learn what Azure Quantum is and how it can be used to solve your quantum computing or quantum-inspired projects at scale.
