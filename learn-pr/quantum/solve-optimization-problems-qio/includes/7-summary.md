Congratulations! You now have a basic understanding of QIO and some of the problems it can solve. Here's a brief recap:

* QIO is based on a computational model called *adiabatic quantum computing*.
* Adiabatic quantum algorithms will eventually run on quantum computers. Today, we can emulate these algorithms by using quantum-inspired techniques on classical hardware.
* QIO works best with problems where the landscape is rugged, with many hills and valleys. The container ship problem you saw here is one example.
* *Simulated annealing* and *quantum annealing* are two techniques that QIO uses to solve optimization problems.
