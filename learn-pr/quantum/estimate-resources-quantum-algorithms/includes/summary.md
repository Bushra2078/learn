Congratulations! You've saved the space fleet against invaders by estimating the resources our enemies, and ourselves, would need to crack the passwords. 

In this module, you've learned:

- What resource estimation is
- How to enable the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator in your workspace.
- How to submit a resource estimation job to Azure Quantum.
- How to customize the input parameters of a resource estimation job.
- How to get the most out of the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator.
- How to estimate the resources of a quantum algorithm, and compare different qubit technologies and architectures.


## Next steps

Now that you understand resource estimation,  you can perform a number of experiments to deepen your knowledge:

- Try estimating the resources for a different Q# program.
- Explore how qubit parameters and QEC schemes affect the error correction code distance of the logical qubit.
- Use the output data to derive logical qubit properties.
- Use the table to experiment with other pre-defined qubit parameters or use your own customized version of qubit parameters.
