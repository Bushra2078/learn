
Quantum computers promise to solve important scientific and commercial problems. Achieving commercial viability will require large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers that have both a large number of qubits in superposition and physical error rates below a certain threshold. Practical quantum advantage will also require quantum error correction (QEC) schemes to achieve fault tolerance. QEC is both time and space intensive, requiring increased execution time for algorithm or logical-level operations, as well as additional physical qubits to store and compute information.

In this context, resource estimation becomes crucial in the development of quantum computers and quantum solutions. We need to  understand the impact of architectural design choices and quantum error correction schemes. 

Get ready! Azure Quantum has developed a tool that allows us to analyze the impact that various choices for architectural parameters such as physical qubit and QEC models have to the overall physical resource estimates. In this module, you'll learn some basic concepts about resource estimation in fault-tolerant quantum computing, and you'll explore the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator.
