Once you have created an Azure Quantum workspace, there are many ways to start running your code in Azure Quantum. A [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook is a document that contains both rich text and code and can run in your browser, and can run Q# and Python code in Azure Quantum. 
Notebooks can be created directly in the Azure Quantum portal, and offer features such as preloaded connection information and standard Q# libraries. 

You will learn more about Jupyter notebooks in Azure Quantum workspace in future lessons.

To get started, copy the sample notebook from the notebook gallery.

1. Select your Azure Quantum workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Notebooks**.
1. Select **Notebook Gallery**.
1. Select the **Parallel QRNG** notebook , and select **Copy to My Notebooks**.

The sample notebook can be found under **My Notebooks** and you can now run the notebook.

To run the Jupyter notebook, follow these steps.

1. Select your Azure Quantum workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Notebooks**.
1. Select the **parallel-qrng** notebook in **My Notebooks**.
1. Select the cell you want to run and select the **run icon** to execute the code in the cell, or select **Run all** to run all cells in the notebook.

The notebook first imports the required packages for the sample, then connects to the Azure Quantum service, and then runs a Q# program.
