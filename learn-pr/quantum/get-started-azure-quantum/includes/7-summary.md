In this module, you learned about the two main solutions that Azure Quantum offers: quantum computing and optimization. You also reviewed some real-world applications.

Quantum computing exploits quantum properties such as superposition, interference, and entanglement to perform computations. For simulating quantum mechanical systems such as molecules, quantum computing provides important speedups.

Optimization problems are important for reducing costs, accelerating processes, and reducing risks. Using quantum-inspired solutions to address optimization problems on classical hardware provides a speedup over traditional approaches.

In this module, you learned how to create a quantum workspace to create and run your jobs on the Azure Quantum service. In the next modules, you'll learn to submit and manage quantum computing and optimization jobs:

* If you want to learn how to submit quantum computing jobs to quantum hardware, see [Run algorithms on quantum hardware by using Azure Quantum](/learn/modules/run-algorithms-quantum-hardware-azure-quantum/?azure-portal=true).
* If you want to learn how to solve optimization problems by using Azure Quantum solvers, see [Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization](/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/?azure-portal=true).
