With an active Azure subscription, your crew is ready to create an Azure Quantum workspace. An Azure Quantum workspace resource, or workspace for short, is a collection of assets associated with running quantum or optimization applications.

To create an Azure Quantum workspace, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using the credentials for your Azure subscription.

1. Select **Create a resource** and then search for **Azure Quantum**. On the results page, you should see a tile for the **Azure Quantum** service.

1. Select **Azure Quantum** and then select  **Create**. This opens a form to create a workspace.

1. Fill out the details of your workspace:
   - **Subscription:** The subscription that you want to associate with this workspace.
   - **Resource group:** The [resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) that you want to assign this workspace to.
   - **Name:** The name of your workspace.
   - **Region:** The region for the workspace.
   - **Storage Account**: The Azure storage account to store your jobs and results. If you don't have an existing storage account, select **Create a new storage account** and complete the necessary fields.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must be an **Owner** of the resource group you use, to create a new storage account. For more information about how resource groups work in Azure, see [Manage Azure Resource Manager resource groups by using the Azure portal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal).

1. After completing the information, select **Next** to the **Providers** tab. You can add providers to your workspace. A provider gives you access to a quantum service, which can be quantum hardware, a quantum simulator, or an optimization service.

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, the Azure Quantum service adds the Microsoft QIO provider to every workspace.

1. Select **Next** and **Next**.

1. Review the setting you've selected and if everything is correct, select **Create** to create your workspace.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Pricing for Azure Quantum varies by provider. Please consult the information in the Providers tab of your Azure Quantum workspace in the Azure portal for the most up-to-date pricing information, or visit the [Azure Quantum pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-quantum/).

## Add additional providers

1. To add more providers to an existing workspace, go to the **Providers** tab in your Quantum workspace and click on **Add a Provider**. Then, select the provider you want to add.
