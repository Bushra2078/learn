One of the services Azure Quantum offers is a solution to quantum computing on real or simulated quantum devices. 

Quantum mechanics is the underlying "operating system" of our universe. It describes how the fundamental building blocks of nature behave. In order to understand nature's behaviors, such as chemical reactions, biological reactions, material formations, etc., which often involve many-body quantum interactions, we rely on being able to simulate them with state-of-the-art computation. Classical computing, which uses binary states, is increasingly challenged as the size of the system grows. As we have seen throughout the [learning path](/learn/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/?azure-portal=true), however, quantum computing makes use of quantum mechanical phenomena such as _superposition_, _interference_, and _entanglement_ to address some of these challenges. For simulating intrinsically quantum mechanical problems, quantum computing is promising, as quantum states can be used to represent the natural states in question.

Superposition enables other quantum mechanical effects such as *interference* and *entanglement*, which in turn empower [quantum algorithms](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm?azure-portal=true) for faster searching, better optimization, and greater security. When designed to scale, quantum systems will have capabilities that exceed our most powerful supercomputers. As the global community of quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, and business leaders continue to collaborate to advance the quantum ecosystem, we expect to see quantum impact accelerate across every industry.

## Application case studies

### Quantum speedups

One of the goals of quantum computing research is to study which problems can be solved by a quantum computer faster than a classical computer and how large the speedup can be. Two well-known examples are [Grover’s algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm?azure-portal=true) and [Shor’s algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm), as mentioned in module [Explore the key concepts of quantum computing by using Q#](/learn/modules/qsharp-explore-key-concepts-quantum-computing/?azure-portal=true). These quantum algorithms yield a polynomial and exponential speedup, respectively, over their classical counterparts.

You may ask why some problems allow exponential speedup whereas others only allow polynomial speedup. The answer lies in the structure of the input. If it is an unstructured problem, such as a list of $n$ random numbers as the input of the algorithm, a quantum computer can achieve polynomial to a quadratic speedup. In Grover's algorithm, for example, it gives a quadratic speedup. On the other hand, when we have a structured problem with a special feature in the input, such a period-finding problem as in Shor's algorithm, a quantum computer can yield an exponential speedup.

Such impressive speedups are one of the most promising aspects of quantum computers. While we wait to run quantum algorithms on a quantum device, we can study speedups theoretically and prove these speedups exist mathematically. To do so, researchers use a query model, or as known in computational complexity, a *decision tree model*. This model consists of a sequence of queries that are done adaptively, so the outcome of the previous tests can influence the test being performed next. The decision tree model is useful in establishing lower and upper bounds for complexity theory of algorithms.

The real upper bound of query complexity for unstructured problems has been an open problem for 20 years. In a 1998 paper, [Beals et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/502090.502097?azure-portal=true) showed that for any total Boolean function $f$ the maximum possible quantum speedup for an unstructured problem is power 6. This can be expressed as $D(ƒ) = Ο(Q(ƒ)^6)$, where $D(f)$ and $Q(f)$ are classical and quantum query complexity of a function $f$, respectively. However, at this time the largest speedup known was only power 2, exhibited by Grover’s algorithm. In a recent paper published in 2020 lead by Microsoft researcher [Robin Kothari et al.](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/quantum-implications-of-huangs-sensitivity-theorem/?azure-portal=true), they showed that, in fact, the deterministic query complexity, D(f), is at most quartic in the quantum query complexity,  $Q(f): D(f)=O(Q(f)^4)$.

The proof technique used in [Robin Kothari et al.](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/quantum-implications-of-huangs-sensitivity-theorem/?azure-portal=true)  can be used to resolve an old conjecture about quantum speedups for graph problems. A [graph](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory?azure-portal=true) is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects. It is defined by a set of vertices and edges, where the edges establish the relations among the vertices. [Graphs problems](https://bennettgarner.medium.com/what-the-graph-a-beginners-simple-intro-to-graphs-in-computer-science-3808d542a0e5?azure-portal=true) are a common source of algorithmic problems in computer science. We can study different properties of a graph, such as the shortest path between two points or identify groups of relationships. The funny thing about theoretical proofs and mathematics is that you never know when you will find a connection with another unsolved problem. The query complexity of monotone graph properties remains unsolved to this day; however, their quantum analogue has been resolved. If you haven't explored it already, there is a module on [solving graph coloring problems by using Grover's search](/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/?azure-portal=true).

Understanding the status quo of quantum computing and the future it promises, you will head back to the spaceship and work with the navigation division to run Grover's algorithm on another Azure Quantum [module](/learn/modules/run-algorithms-quantum-hardware-azure-quantum/?azure-portal=true) for routing between space stations.

### Using quantum computers to address climate change

We are living a quantum revolution. When we can implement algorithms on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, we can begin to solve some of the world's most challenging problems.  Quantum researchers at Microsoft are studying quantum computer applications and how to accomplish them on a large-scale quantum computer. One of the applications they are focusing on is in chemistry to help address one of those significant challenges: climate change.

In the context of climate change, a main issue is to find an efficient catalyst for [carbon fixation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation#:~:text=Carbon%20fixation%20or%20%D1%81arbon%20assimilation,as%20structure%20for%20other%20biomolecules?azure-portal=true), a natural process by which carbon dioxide is turned into valuable chemicals used to store energy. The most well-known example of carbon fixation is photosynthesis: a form of carbon fixation used by plants to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

A synthetic carbon fixation process can help reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by converting $CO_2$ into other useful chemical compounds. Simulation of synthetic catalytic processes requires testing thousands of molecular combinations.

*Protocol of quantum computing enhanced computational catalysis workflow. The energies of all species in the catalytic reaction cycle can be evaluated through the quantum computer using the output parameters of classical computers (upper right).*

Microsoft Quantum researchers have teamed up with researchers at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html?azure-portal=true) to develop a new quantum algorithm to simulate catalytic processes. They have focused on a well-known catalytic process, based on the transition metal Ruthenium, to convert carbon dioxide into methanol. This process is inefficient, so this case study offers an opportunity to test quantum algorithms and find ways to optimize these simulations on a quantum computer.
Problems that involve calculating molecular energies can require a large number of time steps and a large amount of information. This task can be challenging, even for a quantum computer, so we need to reduce the cost of computation before running our quantum algorithms. The natural approach should be to reduce the information to be loaded, that is reducing the size of the input.  In their paper [Quantum computing enhanced computational catalysis](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/quantum-computing-enhanced-computational-catalysis/?azure-portal=true) published in 2020, the authors use a particular representation of the energy of the quantum system, the so-called "double-factorized" Hamiltonian. Here they propose a quantum algorithm based on compression properties of the double-factorized Hamiltonian to reduce runtime by orders of magnitude for obtaining reliable results in comparison to unfactorized or single-factorized forms. Their algorithm is 10,000 times faster than the [previous one](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619152114?azure-portal=true) they proposed for this task, and is the first time a quantum algorithm has been analyzed on a specific chemical reaction along the entire reaction pathway.

It is important to note that the results obtained from this work are not restricted to chemistry and climate change applications. In fact, knowing more about quantum algorithms and boosting calculations opens the door to even more questions about large-scale quantum computers, and exploring other ways that algorithms can be more effective.

### Quantum cryptography

Cryptography is the technique of concealing confidential information using physical or mathematical means, such as leveraging a computational difficulty of solving a particular task. The work of [Peter W. Shor](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/365700?azure-portal=true) uncovered the security threat that quantum computation posed to classical cryptographic schemes that are based on assumptions of the difficulty of factoring large numbers. One example of a cryptographic scheme is the [Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) scheme](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)), which is widely used in e-commerce for secure data transmission. It is based on the practical difficulty of factoring prime numbers using classical algorithms.

[Quantum cryptography](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography?azure-portal=true) promises information security by harnessing basic physics rather than complexity assumptions. RSA is safe today because a scalable quantum computer is not yet available. But once quantum computers are built at large scale, polynomial time quantum algorithms could attack the underlying math problems for these cryptosystems, and thus RSA would become insecure.

In [Unit 8 of module Explore the key concepts of quantum computing by using Q#](/learn/modules/qsharp-explore-key-concepts-quantum-computing/8-introduction-quantum-algorithms/?azure-portal=true), you can find an overview of Shor's algorithm application in cryptography.

With the anticipation of a sufficiently large and fault-tolerant quantum computer, active research is underway to estimate the security for cryptosystems of a given bit-length in a post-quantum environment, and to estimate how long it will take to migrate current cryptosystems to new ones.  In collaboration with researchers in [QuArC](https://www.microsoft.com/research/blog/cryptography-quantum-computing-intersect/?azure-portal=true), Microsoft has been developing concrete quantum estimates for breaking current encryption systems, and also  working on ways to make them robust against quantum attacks. Again, let's talk about graphs. The “path-finding problem” is a hard problem for explicit choices of expander graphs and [has been proposed](http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/021.pdf?azure-portal=true) to develop post-quantum cryptosystems, meaning classical protocols that are resistant to quantum attacks.

The interaction between academia and industry, and, as a result, the development of commercially viable quantum cryptography products, has been relatively thriving in the past years. Quantum cryptography is a reality, and we can expect mathematicians and cryptographers to be busy during the next few years to determine the best possible choices for post-quantum cryptography standards.
