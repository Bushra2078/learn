Congratulations! You just learned how to use the Azure Quantum platform to run
your Q# quantum computing programs on quantum hardware.

In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

* Azure Quantum, enables you to run Q#
  programs on quantum computers through top-class providers.
* To build quantum computers, we need full access to the controllable quantum
systems to represent the qubits.
* Trapped ion and superconducting qubit quantum computers are the two most prominent platforms for quantum computing nowadays.
* You can use the Azure Quantum CLI to submit and manage jobs to quantum computers.
* The Azure Quantum system offers three different kinds of profiles, Full, No Control Flow, and Basic Measurement Feedback to handle the control flow limitations of early quantum computers.
