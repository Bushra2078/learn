Now that you know how to use Azure Quantum, you are ready to start running your
own experiments with real quantum hardware.

Current quantum computers offer a limited number of qubits, but this number is
expected to grow in the next years. Meanwhile, you can start testing your
quantum applications and preparing yourself for the quantum revolution. Let's
see some things that you can do with current quantum devices.

## Run tests of quantum mechanics

Quantum computers are a fantastic platform to continue the scientific validation
of quantum theories. The widely available access to controllable quantum devices
empowers researchers and enthusiasts to run scientific tests without the need of
access to restricted expensive laboratories.

For example, you can use Q# and Azure Quantum to verify the validity of quantum
theory by realizing an empirical observation of the violation of quantum
inequalities. A famous example of this experiments with a Q# implementation is
the CHSH game.
