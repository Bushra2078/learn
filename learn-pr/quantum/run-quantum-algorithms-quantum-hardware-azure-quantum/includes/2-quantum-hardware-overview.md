Modern classical computers are based on transistor technologies made from semiconductors to implement classical logic operations. Quantum computers take
radically different approaches to exploit the properties of quantum systems, to implement qubits and quantum operations.

In this unit, you will learn about different challenges we face to build a quantum computer. You will also learn the different types of physical systems used to make qubits and how quantum devices are designed. 

## Harnessing quantum systems to make computations

To build quantum computers, we need full access to the controllable quantum
systems to represent the qubits that we use to store the quantum information. In
general, a functional quantum computer should fulfill the following criteria:

- **Scalability of qubits:** since quantum computers are based in the
  manipulation of quantum information by using qubits, we need a system that allows scalability to a large number of qubits. A qubit can be represented by any
  physical system with **two** *states* or *levels* that can be prepared in a
  quantum superposition.
- **Ability to initialize the qubits in a specific state:** having many qubits
  isn't useful if we can't trust their initial state. A fundamental
  characteristic of a quantum computer is its ability to initialize the qubits
  reliably to a specific state (usually, the state $|0\rangle$).
- **Resilient qubits:** quantum states are very delicate. The smallest
  interaction with the environment can "contaminate" the state of the qubits and
  ruin our computations. Qubit registers needs to be able to remain in a
  consistent quantum state long enough for us to perform the computations. The
  time a qubit can remain in a specific quantum state is often called *coherence
  time*.
- **Ability to perform a universal set of operations:** like in classical
  computing, any quantum algorithm can be decomposed as the application of
  a sequence of operations from a universal set of basic operations. This set is
  not unique, but a quantum computer should be able to reliably perform all the
  operations of a specific universal set.
- **Qubit specific reliable measurements:** to obtain the results of quantum
  computations we need to measure of each qubit with high precision. Note that
  the measurement affects the state of the register. It's often performed only
  at the end of the computation.

These five criteria are often known as the *Divicenzo* criteria for quantum
computation.

Building devices that meet these five criteria is one of the most demanding
engineering challenges ever faced by humankind. However, in the recent years
astounding advances in condensed matter physics and quantum optics are allowing
companies and universities to build the first working version of quantum
computers. Microsoft is partnering with some of the best-in-class quantum computer
manufacturers around the world to give you access to the latest quantum
computing solutions through Azure Quantum. Let's see an overview of the
different technologies used to create quantum computers.

### Trapped ion quantum computers

Trapped ion quantum computers use *ions* (electrically charged atoms) suspended
in an electromagnetic field in vacuum as the basic element to represent
qubits.

In particular, these computers use chains of trapped ions and each ion
represents a qubit. They use the vibrational motion of the chain to induce
operations in the qubit states. The qubit states are stored in the internal
states of each ion. In particular, the qubit states are often stored in two
hyperfine levels of the ion.

> [!NOTE]
> The hyperfine levels of an atom arise from the different possible
> configurations of the spin orientations of the electron and the nucleus.
> Generally, the state with the lower energy, the ground state, is associated
> with the state $|0\rangle$, and the first excited state is associated with the
> qubit state $|1\rangle$.

These computers use lasers and electromagnetic pulses to cause
transitions in the internal states of the ions and to modify the vibrational
motion of the ion chain. By combining very carefully transformations of the
vibrational motion of the ion chain and individual ion transitions, it's
possible to get qubits entangled and apply an universal set of quantum
operations.

Azure Quantum provides access to trapped ion quantum devices through our
partners IonQ and Honeywell. In this module you'll submit quantum operations to
this kind of devices.

### Superconducting quantum computers

Superconducting quantum computers are based in superconducting electronic
circuits. While classical computers use circuits of transistors to represent
bits and perform classical computations, superconducting qubits use *transmons*
to represent qubits and perform quantum operations.

If certain materials are cooled below a critical temperature, their electric
resistance drops to zero. These materials are called **superconductors**. By
linking two superconductors with a thin insulating barrier, you can build
*transmons*, an electronic device that can exist in a superposition of two
states. Transmons can be considered analogous to transistors. While in
transistors you use junctions of semiconductors to represent controllable bits,
in transmons you use junctions of superconductors to represent controllable
qubits.

transitor representing a bit, and a transmon representing a qubit]

There are other variants of superconducting circuits that don't use transmons
but similar technologies. However, transmons are the key component in most
cloud-available superconducting quantum computers.

Since superconducting properties appear at very low temperatures and higher
temperatures imply more noise, these quantum computers work at very low
temperatures, near absolute zero. This is why these chips are usually contained
in big cryostats.

### Other types of quantum computers

Trapped ion and superconducting quantum computers aren't the only options for
quantum computing, although are the most advanced so far. In general, any
controllable quantum system with two levels can be used to represent qubits. For
example:

- **Quantum dot computers:** quantum dots are small cumulus of semiconductor
  atoms that behave like macroscopic atoms and can be prepared into superposed
  states. They can be used to represent qubits.
- **Photonic quantum computers:** they use polarized photons to represent qubits
  and light guides to implement quantum operations.
- **Topological quantum computers:** a theoretical proposal for quantum
  computers that use a new type of material called *anyons* to create qubits
  very resilient to noise.

There many other proposals for quantum computers since the field is still under
development. With Azure Quantum you have access to an ever-increasing collection
of quantum computers to run your own quantum algorithms.

### Azure Quantum for cloud quantum computing

Azure Quantum is a cloud computing hub where you can connect to different
industry leading providers to use their most advanced quantum computers.

You just need an Azure subscription to start submitting quantum computing jobs
to Azure Quantum. These jobs will be queued by the provider to be run in the
target device you select. Through Azure Quantum you can manage your jobs and
monitor their states.
