Azure Quantum is a cloud service that offers two different types of services: *optimization* solutions,
which allow you to solve optimization problems by running optimization algorithms on classical hardware
to address optimization problems; and *quantum computing* solutions which allow you to run Q# quantum programs on real or simulated quantum devices.
access to quantum computing targets where you can run Q# quantum programs in
real or simulated quantum devices.

The earlier modules in this [learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/) focused on the theoretical aspects of quantum computing. If you went through the learning path thus far, you have experienced quantum computing as a member of a space mission on a spaceship. Now you are ready to access Azure Quantum servers on Earth. 

In this module, you're ready to start using real quantum computers to run your Q# quantum programs. 
You'll explore the quantum computing options in Azure Quantum and manage submissions of quantum computing jobs. 

You'll also learn the basic principles behind quantum hardware and the different kinds of target devices that you have access to in Azure Quantum.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Differentiate and comprehend the main hardware solutions for quantum computers.
- Understand how Azure Quantum provides you with access to quantum devices to run quantum algorithms.
- Adapt and create Q# applications to run them in Azure Quantum.
- Submit and manage jobs in Azure Quantum in your preferred environment: Python, Jupyter or the Azure CLI.

## Prerequisites

- Module [How to create an Azure Quantum workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals)
- Module [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/)
