Azure Quantum offers two different types of services: *optimization* solutions,
where you can run first class optimization algorithms in classical hardware to
address optimization problems; and *quantum computing* solutions, where you have
access to quantum computing targets where you can run Q# quantum programs in
real or simulated quantum devices.

In this module, you'll explore the quantum computing options in Azure Quantum and manage the submissions.

You'll also learn the basic principles behind quantum hardware and the different
kinds of target devices that you have access to in Azure Quantum.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Differentiate and comprehend the main hardware solutions for quantum computers.
- Understand how Azure Quantum provides you with access to quantum devices to run quantum algorithms.
- Adapt and create Q# applications to run them in Azure Quantum.
- Submit and manage jobs in Azure Quantum in your preferred environment: Python, Jupyter or the Azure CLI.
