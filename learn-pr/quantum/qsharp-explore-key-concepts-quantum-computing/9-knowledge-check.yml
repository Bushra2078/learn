  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which one of these statements about quantum computing is true?'
    choices:
    - content: 'A quantum computer uses superposition to calculate all outputs of an algorithm at once.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quantum computers don't calculate all outputs at once. Instead, they use superposition, interference, and entanglement to make algorithms that are more efficient than classical algorithms."
    - content: 'A quantum computer is faster than classical computers for all tasks.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Quantum computers provide an advantage only for certain tasks.'
    - content: 'A quantum computer exploits superposition, interference, and entanglement to do calculations faster than classical computers.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Learning how to exploit these three phenomena is the key to designing better quantum algorithms.'
      
  - content: 'The probability amplitude of a qubit state is:'
    choices:
    - content: 'The probability of obtaining the qubit state when you measure the qubit.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The probability of obtaining the qubit state is the absolute value of the probability amplitude squared.'
    - content: 'A complex number that encodes the phase, and the probability of obtaining the qubit state when you measure the qubit.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'We can obtain the probability by squaring the absolute value of the probability amplitude.'
    - content: 'A complex number whose absolute value squared tells you the probability that the algorithm will succeed.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Probability amplitudes are associated with quantum states rather than with algorithms.'

  - content: 'Qubit states behave like waves. Which one of these statements is true about quantum interference?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Constructive interference occurs when two states of opposite phase superpose.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Constructive interference occurs when two states of the same phase superpose.'
    - content: 'Quantum interference is a phenomenon in which electromagnetic waves produce noise in our quantum computations.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Quantum interference is not related to electromagnetic interference.'
    - content: 'We can exploit quantum interference to do calculations faster than classical computers can do them.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Quantum interference is one of the key parts of efficient quantum algorithms.'

  - content: 'If two qubits are entangled:'
    choices:
    - content: 'Changing the state of one of the qubits directly changes the state of the other.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Operations on one entangled qubit don't change the partial state of the other qubit."
    - content: 'The measurement outcomes of those qubits are strongly correlated.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "We know that two qubits are entangled if measurements of the qubits present correlations that classical physics alone can't explain."
    - content: 'Both qubits always produce the same results when you measure their individual states, no matter how you manipulate them.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Two qubits can be entangled but also be in different partial states. They can yield different results when you measure their states.'
