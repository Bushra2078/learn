For some computational tasks, quantum computing provides exponential speedups. These speedups are possible thanks to three phenomena from
quantum mechanics: superposition, interference, and entanglement.

In the [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit?azure-portal=true) module, you used superposition to generate random numbers from qubits. In this part, you'll learn more about superposition.

## Quantum computers are quantum systems

Quantum computers are controllable quantum mechanical devices that exploit the properties of quantum physics to perform computations. You may have seen or heard about the Schrödinger equation that describes every quantum mechanical system:

$$i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(t)= \hat H \psi(t).$$

This equation captures the _wave function_, $\psi(t)$, and the energy Hamiltonian, $\hat H$, of the system. Here, $t$ is time and $\hbar$ is the Planck constant.

Fortunately, you don't need the Schrödinger equation to do quantum programming. In practice, nobody thinks in terms of the Schrödinger equation when they write quantum algorithms. But we can use the equation to help us understand some concepts of quantum computing.

The Schrödinger equation determines the evolution of the state of the system,
represented by the wave function $\psi$. Each wave function is associated with
an important concept in quantum computing: the *probability amplitude* of the
wave function. The probability amplitude is a complex number that determines the probability of
getting a certain outcome when we measure
the system. 

The probability amplitude is an important difference from classical computing. In quantum computing, we don't describe bits as being in determined, factual states. Rather, we describe bits by the probabilities of finding their states when we observe them.

### What's Dirac bra-ket notation?

A handy notation to describe quantum states is the Dirac bra-ket notation. In this notation, we describe the possible states of quantum systems by using kets $| \rangle$.

For example, $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are two possible states of a qubit. A qubit in the state $|\psi\rangle = |0\rangle$ means that the probability of observing `Zero` when we measure the qubit is 100 percent. Similarly, a qubit in the state $|\psi\rangle =|1\rangle$ produces `One` we measure it.

## What are linear operators?

An *operator* is a function that transforms the state of a quantum system to another state.

$$A |\psi\rangle = |\psi'\rangle$$

We say that an operator $A$ is *linear* when it has the following properties
for addition and multiplication by a complex number $a$:

$$A( |\psi_1\rangle + |\psi_2\rangle) =  A |\psi_1\rangle + A|\psi_2\rangle$$

$$A(a|\psi\rangle)=a  A(|\psi\rangle)$$

### How do linear operators relate to quantum superposition?

The Schrödinger equation is a linear equation. It implies that if two states
$ |\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$ are solutions of the Schrödinger equation
(in other words, valid quantum states), then any linear combination of the states is also a valid
quantum state:

$$|\psi\rangle=a |\psi_1\rangle+b|\psi_2\rangle.$$

This linear combination of $ |\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$ is called a
superposition of $ |\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$. Here, $a$ and $b$ are the
probability amplitudes of $ |\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$, respectively.
Remember that in the module [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum
Development
Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit?azure-portal=true)
you used superposition to create a quantum random number generator. You used the operation `H` to put a qubit that's in the state $|0\rangle$ into superposition.
Mathematically, this equation is $$  H |0\rangle = \frac1{\sqrt2} |0\rangle +
\frac1{\sqrt2} |1\rangle.$$

Linearity is a fundamental property of
quantum mechanics and therefore of quantum computing.

## Quantum computers are probabilistic

A fundamental difference between classical computers and quantum computers is
that programs in quantum computers are intrinsically probabilistic, whereas classical
computers are usually deterministic. Quantum algorithms consist of linear operations that are
applied to a register of qubits to modify the states to a particular
superposition of all possibilities. Each possible state has an associated
probability amplitude. When we make a measurement, we obtain one of the possible
states with a certain probability. This fact contrasts with classical computing,
where a bit can only be deterministically **0** or **1**.

These characteristics mean that sometimes you have to run the algorithm several
times to ensure the highest probability result in the output. This repetition
might seem inefficient. But in many cases, running quantum algorithms several
times is much more efficient than solving the task classically.

In the next figure, you can see a simplified comparison between qubits and bits:

The following figure shows the probability associated with each simplified qubit. 
 
![Figure depicting the probability associated with each simplified qubit.](../media/2-probability.png)

These examples don't represent actual qubits. After all, coins and marble
vending machines can't exist in superposition states. But the examples help us visualize
the probabilities. Only quantum systems like ions or superconducting circuits
can exist in the superposition states that enable the power of quantum
computing.

How do we know the probabilities associated with a given superposition? Suppose we have a register of two qubits that can be in a superposition of four possible states: $$|\psi\rangle = a |00\rangle + b |01\rangle + c |10\rangle + d |11\rangle.$$

Remember that $a,b,c$ and $d$ are probability amplitudes for each state. Their
absolute values, for example $|a|$, squared, give the corresponding probabilities. For
instance, the probability for observing $|00\rangle$ is $P(00)=|a|^2$. For
$|01\rangle$, it's $P(01)=|b|^2$, and so on.

![Figure showing multiple qubit systems. A qubit system is all the possible configurations in superposition. This pie chart denotes the probability of each configuration.](../media/2-configurations.svg)

There are no restrictions on the types of numbers the probability amplitudes can
be. They can be positive, negative, or even complex numbers. However, in a valid quantum superposition, all probabilities must sum to one: $|a|^2+|b|^2+|c|^2+|d|^2=1$. This constraint is often known as the _normalization condition_. You can think of the normalization condition as the fact that you always obtain an outcome when you measure, so the probabilities of measuring every possible outcome must sum to one.

In the next figure, you see how the number of parameters needed to simulate a
quantum superposition grows exponentially with the number of qubits. That growth doesn't mean that the information that we can store in a superposition grows
exponentially with the number of qubits. After all, we can't obtain the complete
information about the superposition. We obtain only the results after a measurement.

![Figure explaining that the number of possible configurations grows exponentially with the number of qubits as 2 to the N. The number of possible combinations of amplitude is infinite, as long as their squares add up to 1.](../media/2-scale.png)

In the example state we produced for the quantum random bit generator,
$|\psi\rangle=\frac1{\sqrt2} |0\rangle + \frac1{\sqrt2} |1\rangle$, the probability
for each state is

$$P(0)=\left|\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2=\frac12;$$
$$P(1)=\left|\frac1{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2=\frac12.$$

Each state has a 50-percent probability of being measured, so we have a balanced
bit generator. We also can check that $\frac12 + \frac12 = 1$.

In the next part, you'll use Q# to see how to prepare different superpositions of qubits and inspect their probabilities.
