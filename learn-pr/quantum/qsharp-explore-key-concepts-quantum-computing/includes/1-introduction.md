Quantum computers work in fundamentally different ways from classical computers. They can offer solutions when classical computers run into limitations.

Quantum algorithms aren't always faster than their classical counterparts. But for certain tasks, such as factoring large numbers or inverting functions, quantum computers provide important speed-ups.

How can quantum computers perform better than classical computers? In this module, you'll learn about three fundamental concepts behind the power of quantum computing: _superposition_,
_interference_, and _entanglement_. You'll use Q# and some of the tools provided by the Quantum Development Kit to see these concepts in action.

You'll also explore a few quantum algorithms to see how superposition, interference, and entanglement enables you to create quantum algorithms that outperform classical computers.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the basic theory behind the power of quantum computing, including concepts like superposition, interference, and entanglement.
- Inspect quantum states when running code in simulated quantum computers.
- Estimate the quantum resources that are needed to run your programs.
- Explore algorithms that make use of quantum properties that outperform classical algorithms.

## Prerequisites

- The latest version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download?azure-portal=true)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true)
- The [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line?view=qsharp-preview&tabs=tabid-vscode?azure-portal=true)

If you don't have these tools installed, we recommend that you go through the [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit?azure-portal=true) to get set up and learn the basics.

You also need basic knowledge of linear algebra and complex numbers. These
Python tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks can help you to understand the
basics. You can run them locally or online.
