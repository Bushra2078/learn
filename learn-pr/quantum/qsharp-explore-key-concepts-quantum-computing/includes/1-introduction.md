As part of the mission, you need to get some theoretical formation to operate quantum computers. You'll learn some basic concepts on quantum physics and explore the tools that will help you to achieve your tasks. Don't worry, this module is specially created for crew members with no previous knowledge in quantum physics. 

Quantum computers work fundamentally differently from classical computers. They can offer solutions when classical computers run into limitations.

Quantum algorithms aren't always faster than their classical counterparts. But for certain tasks, such as factoring large numbers or inverting functions, quantum computers provide important speedups.

How can quantum computers perform better than classical computers? In this module, you'll learn about three fundamental concepts behind the power of quantum computing: _superposition_, _interference_, and _entanglement_. To see these concepts in action, you'll use Q# and some of the tools provided by the Quantum Development Kit.

You'll also explore a few quantum algorithms to see how superposition, interference, and entanglement enable you to create quantum algorithms that outperform classical algorithms.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the basic theory behind the power of quantum computing, including concepts like superposition, interference, and entanglement.
- Inspect quantum states when you run code on simulated quantum computers.
- Estimate the quantum resources that are needed to run your programs.
- Explore algorithms that use quantum properties to outperform classical algorithms.

## Prerequisites

- The latest version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download?azure-portal=true)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true)
- The [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line?view=qsharp-preview&tabs=tabid-vscode?azure-portal=true)

If you haven't installed these tools, we recommend that you go through the [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit?azure-portal=true) to get set up and learn the basics.

You also need basic knowledge of linear algebra and complex numbers. To get yourself up to speed, check out the following
Python tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks. You can run these notebooks locally or online.
