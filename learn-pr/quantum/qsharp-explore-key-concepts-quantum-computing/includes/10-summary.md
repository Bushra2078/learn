In this module, you learned about three fundamental concepts behind the power of quantum computing: superposition, interference, and entanglement.

Here's a brief summary:

- Superposition, interference, and entanglement can enable quantum computers to perform some calculations faster than classical computers.
- Superposition is a consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics. You can place qubit registers into superpositions in your quantum algorithms.
- Each of the states of a superposition has an associated probability amplitude. This probability amplitude is a complex number that encodes the probability of measuring the state and the phase of that state.
- The phase of a quantum state is relevant for quantum interference. States that have opposite phases interfere destructively. States that have the same phase interfere constructively.
- Two qubits are entangled if their states are correlated and if they can't be described as two independent qubits.

The [Quantum Development Kit (QDK)](/quantum/quickstarts/get-started) offers many tools to boost quantum development. In this module, you used `DumpMachine` to inspect quantum states. You used `ResourcesEstimator` to see what resources you need to run your program on a quantum computer.
