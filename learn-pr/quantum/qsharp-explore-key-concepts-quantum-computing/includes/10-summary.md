Congratulations! You finished the module Explore the key concepts of quantum
computing by using Q#. This module
served you as an introduction to the working principles of quantum computers.

In this module, we presented a lot of new concepts. Here we list a few concepts
worth remembering:

- Quantum computers use superposition, interference, and entanglement do some
  calculations faster than classical computers.
- Superposition is a consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics. We can
  put qubit registers into superpositions in our quantum algorithms.
- Each of the states of a superposition has associated a probability amplitude.
  This probability amplitude is a complex number that encodes the probability of
  measuring the state and the phase of the state.
- The phase of a quantum state is relevant for quantum interference. States with
  opposite phase interfere destructively, whereas states with the same phase
  interfere constructively.
- Two qubits are entangled if their states are correlated and cannot be described as two independent qubits.
- The Quantum Development Kit offers many different tools to boost quantum
  development. In this module we used the function `DumpMachine` to inspect quantum states in
  simulated computers and the `ResourcesEstimator` to see what resources we need
  to run a particular program.
