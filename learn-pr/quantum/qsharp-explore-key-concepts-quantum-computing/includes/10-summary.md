In this module, you learned about three fundamental concepts behind the power of quantum computing: _superposition_, _interference_, and _entanglement_.

Here's a brief summary:

- Superposition, interference, and entanglement can enable quantum computers to perform some calculations faster than classical computers.
- Superposition is a consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics. You can place qubit registers into superpositions in your quantum algorithms.
- Each of the states of a superposition has an associated probability amplitude. This probability amplitude is a complex number that encodes the probability of measuring the state and the phase of that state.
- The phase of a quantum state is relevant for quantum interference. States with opposite phase interfere destructively, whereas states with the same phase interfere constructively.
- Two qubits are entangled if their states are correlated and cannot be described as two independent qubits.

The Quantum Development Kit offers many different tools to boost quantum development. In this module, you used `DumpMachine` to inspect quantum states and `ResourcesEstimator` to see what resources you need  to run your program on a quantum computer.
