  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'To run a Q# program...'
    choices:
    - content: 'You need to use a host program written in Python or C#.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You don't necessarily need to use a host program, you can invoke Q# code directly from the CLI. But you can combine them with programos in Python or .NET languages if you need additional funcionality not available for Q#."
    - content: 'You need to use C# since Q# is just a library of C#.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Q# is not a library of C# but an independent language designed for quantum computers. You can run Q# programs directly from the CLI or using host programs written in Python or C#.'
    - content: 'You can combine the code with a host program written in Python or a .NET language but you can also execute Q# code alone using the CLI or Q# Jupyter Notebooks.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'You can combine them with programs in Python or .NET languages if you need additional funcionality not available for Q#.'
