  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'To run a Q# program...'
    choices:
    - content: 'You need to use a host program written in Python or C#.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You don't necessarily need to use a host program, you can invoke Q# code directly from the CLI. But you can combine them with programos in Python or .NET languages if you need additional funcionality not available for Q#."
    - content: 'You need to use C# since Q# is just a library of C#.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Q# is not a library of C# but an independent language designed for quantum computers. You can run Q# programs directly from the CLI or using host programs written in Python or C#.'
    - content: 'You can combine the code with a host program written in Python or a .NET language but you can also execute Q# code alone using the CLI or Q# Jupyter Notebooks.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'You can combine them with programs in Python or .NET languages if you need additional funcionality not available for Q#.'
      
  - content: 'Select which of the following sentences about the chemistry library is true.'
    choices:
    - content: 'The chemistry library is used to generate interactive 3D visualizations of molecules.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The chemistry library does not provide tools to generate 3D models of molecules.'
    - content: 'The chemistry library provides the necessary tools to do calculations like the energy levels of a molecule with quantum algorithms.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'The energy levels of molecules are important to predict and understand properties of different materials.'
    - content: "The chemistry library uses Grover's search algorithm to find the energy levels of a molecule."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The chemistry library doesn't use Grover's algorithm. It uses the phase estimation algorithm to obtain the energy levels."
      
  - content: 'Select which of the following sentences about the quantum machine learning library is true.'
    choices:
    - content: 'The quantum machine learning library allows you to run neural networks in quantum computers.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The quantum machine learning library currently doesn't implement neural networks, but a different model called circuit centric classifier."
    - content: 'With the quantum machin learning library you can create computer vision models that improves the result of the state of the art classical models.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The quantum machine learning library is a research enviornment with a limited scope. It cannot compete with the current standard machine learning framworks.'
    - content: 'The quantum machine learning library is a suitable place to start running experiments of quantum machine learning, but does not provide commercial applications.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'The samples and tutorials of the quantum machine learning library are a great starting point to introduce the field of quantum machine learning.'
