Q# provides you with an increasing number of libraries that will help you leverage existing functionalities to create advanced quantum algorithms.
In this module you will explore some of these interoperability tools and learn about the different libraries currently available in the Quantum Development Kit (QDK).

You are in desperate need of a book on how to grow poppy seeds in outer space, but the intergalactic online library only lets you search for books by their identifying number sequence (ISBN). You had written it down on a sticky note, but after spilling your coffee while the spaceship went through an asteroid field, one of the digits is now illegible.
By implementing Grover's algorithm with the Q# Standard Library you will determine the missing digit and save your ship.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Learn about libraries in Q#, specifically how they are distributed and how to add them to your projects
- Use Q# to express quantum algorithms at a high level
- Get to know the API documentation and integrated help capabilities to more efficiently find and use Q# functionality
- Write API documentation comments to help document and explain your Q# programs

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of how Grover's algorithm works. If you completed the [prior module on using the algorithm](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/) you are all set, but otherwise the overview can be found at the [Grover Search Algorithm unit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/5-grovers-algorithm) therein.
- A functioning QDK environment, preferably in VS Code for command-line applications or in Jupyter Notebook and IQ#.
