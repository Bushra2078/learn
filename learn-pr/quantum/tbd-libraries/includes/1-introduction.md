Q# provides you with an increasing number of libraries that will help you to leverage existing functionalities to create advanced quantum algorithms. In this module you will explore some of these interoperability tools and learn about the different libraries currently available in the Quantum Development Kit.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Use Q# to express quantum algorithms at a high level
- Get to know the API documentation and integrated help capabilities to more efficiently find and use Q# functionality
- Write API documentation comments to help document and explain your Q# programs
- Use diagnostic functions and operations to check that quantum programs work correctly and to build robust unit tests

## Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook and IQ#; from a conda-based install (recommended) or a mybinder.org instance
