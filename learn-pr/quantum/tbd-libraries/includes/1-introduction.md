Since Q# is a domain specific language for quantum programming, Q# differs from other programming languages in that it is designed to be great at writing quantum programs.  This means that Q# makes some choices as to what features to include and which features to drop. However, the Quantum Development Kit offers great flexibility and interoperability with different environments. You can choose your favorite classical environment to take advantage of all the existing infrastructure and call Q# whenever you need a quantum calculation.

Q# provides you with an increasing number of libraries that will help you to leverage existing functionalities to create advanced quantum algorithms. In this module you will explore some of this interoperability and learn about the different libraries currently available in the Quantum Development Kit.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Learn how to integrate your Q# applications with a Python or C# *host-program*, which can call Q# operations and then process the returned data.
- Roll the dice: use a host program to repeatedly call a quantum random number generator, collecting and visualizing the results.
- Discover the additional domain-specific Q# libraries at your disposal.
- See how the quantum chemistry library can be used to estimate the ground state energy of a molecular system
- Learn about the quantum machine learning library, a research playground to test circuit-centric classifiers.
- Explore the numerics library to implement arithmetic operations with qubit registers and learn how it can be used to implement Shor's factoring algorithm.

## Prerequisites

- If you would like to use a Python host program, then you should have Python installed. 
- The latest version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download?azure-portal=true)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true)
