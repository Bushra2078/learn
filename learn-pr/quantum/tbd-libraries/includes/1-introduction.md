## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Learn how to integrate your Q# applications with a Python or C# *host-program*, which can call Q# operations and then process the returned data.
- Roll the dice: use a host program to repeatedly call a quantum random number generator, collecting and visualizing the results.
- Discover the additional domain-specific Q# libraries at your disposal.
- See how the quantum chemistry library can be used to estimate the ground state energy of a molecular system
- Use the machine learning library to ... TBD
- Use the numerics library to implement Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring composite numbers which is exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.


## Prerequisites

- If you would like to use a Python host program, then you should probably have Python. 
- The latest version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download?azure-portal=true)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true)
