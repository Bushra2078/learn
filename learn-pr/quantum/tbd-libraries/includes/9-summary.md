In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

* The QDK includes multiple Q# libraries: the standard library as well as domain-specific libraries for numerics, chemistry, and machine-learning. New Q# projects have access to the standard library by default, whereas using the others requires explicitly adding them to the project.
* Q# libraries, both from the QDK and third-party developers, are distributed as NuGet packages and added to Q# projects in the same manner.
* The API reference documentation is an invaluable tool when developing with the QDK, be sure to take advantage of it.
* Documenting your own code can help not only others but also yourself through editor assistance in VS Code as well as Jupyter Notebooks.

* In addition to the API reference documentation, you can find conceptual documentation and further learning resources at the [Microsoft Quantum Documentation](/quantum/?azure-portal=true).
