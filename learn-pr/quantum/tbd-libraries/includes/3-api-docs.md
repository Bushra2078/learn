When working with nearly any programming language, one of the most important development tools at your disposal is the API documentation itself.
In this unit, you will familiarize yourself with the Q# API documentation: where to find it and how to read it. 

## Where is it?

The official documentation for the Q# libraries can be found from the [Microsoft Quantum Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/?view=qsharp-preview) homepage, under the **API reference** tab in the table of contents:

Alongside **Q# libraries**, notice there are a few other sets of API documentation. 
We won't focus on them here, but note that they concern various other parts of the QDK:
- *.NET libraries* contains references for the trace simulator target machine and the *.NET* quantum chemistry library (those parts of the quantum chemistry library which are represented outside the Q# program)
- *Python libraries* contains details regarding integration with Python as a host program
