Azure Quantum offers quantum computing solutions, where a spedific division of the space crew have access to quantum computing targets where they can run Q# quantum programs in real or simulated quantum devices. In particular, the navigation division will run the Grover's algorithm in Q# for routing between space stations. However search problem like this are not the only problems you can study. 

In this part we present to you other problems of interest which are case of study in quantum computing.

Write about the current state of quantum hardware, problems that can use 1-2 qubits to solve, ground state of water molecules, link to chemistry simulation documentation. Then in the future we will be able to use quantum computing for N2 fixation, etc. 

-------------------

Quantum computing makes use of wave-like properties of nature to
encode information in qubits that can process highly complex calculations
more quickly. Where current computers would require billions of years to
solve the worldâ€™s most challenging problems, with the right algorithm, a
scaled quantum computer could find a solution in weeks, days, or hours.

When designed to scale, quantum systems will have capabilities that
exceed our most powerful supercomputers. As the global community of
quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, and business leaders continue
to collaborate to advance the quantum ecosystem, we expect to see
quantum impact accelerate across every industry.

Superposition enables quantum mechanical effects such as interference, tunneling, and entanglement,
which in turn empower quantum algorithms for faster searching, better
optimization, and greater security.
