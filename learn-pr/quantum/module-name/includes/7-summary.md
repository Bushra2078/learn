In this module, you learned about the two main services Azure Quantum offers: quantum computing and optimization solutions. You also reviewed some real-case applications. 

Quantum computing exploits quantum properties such as superposition, interference and entanglement to perform computations. For simulating quantum mechanical systems such as molecules, quantum computing provides important speedups.

Optimization problems are very important for reducing costs, accelerating processes, and reducing risks. Using quantum-inspired solutions to address optimization problems on classical hardware provides a speedup over traditional approaches.

In this module, you learned how to create a quantum workspace to create and run your jobs on the Azure Quantum service. In the next modules, you will learn to submit and manage quantum computing and optimization jobs:

- If you want to learn how to submit quantum computing jobs to quantum hardware, check out [Run algorithms on quantum hardware by using Azure Quantum](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/run-algorithms-quantum-hardware-azure-quantum/?azure-portal=true).
- If you want to learn how to solve optimization problems using Azure Quantum solvers, check out [Quantum Inspired Optimization module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/?azure-portal=true).
