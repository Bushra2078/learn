Welcome to Azure Quantum!

Azure Quantum is a cloud service for quantum computing and optimization applications. 

In the [Quantum Computing Foundations learning path](), your spaceship crew has been using quantum algorithms to support your astroid mining mission in the many-worlds. But the algorithms had been run on a simulator enabled by the [Quantum Development Kit](). You are finally establishing communication with Earth. You need to connect to the hardware through Azure Quantum on Earth and run your algorithms for the mission. 

In this module, you'll set up your access to Azure Quantum and run your first quantum program on hardware through the cloud. Different divisions of your crew will need one of the two different types of solutions that Azure Quantum offers:

- Quantum computing targets to run quantum algorithms in real or simulated quantum devices. The navigation division will run the Grover's algorithm in Q# for routing between space stations.

- Solvers to address optimization problems using classical hardware. The logistics and maintenance divisions will need this optimization service for cargo vessel loading and job scheduling prioritization. 

You will be carrying out these tasks in the upcoming modules.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Discover what the Azure Quantum service has to offer: Quantum computing and Optimization
- Prepare your Azure account to use Azure Quantum.
- Create a Quantum Workspace.
