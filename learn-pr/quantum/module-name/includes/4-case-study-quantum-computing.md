Quantum computing makes use of wave-like properties of nature to
encode information in qubits that can process highly complex calculations
more quickly. Where current computers would require billions of years to
solve the worldâ€™s most challenging problems, with the right algorithm, a
scaled quantum computer could find a solution in weeks, days, or hours.

When designed to scale, quantum systems will have capabilities that
exceed our most powerful supercomputers. As the global community of
quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, and business leaders continue
to collaborate to advance the quantum ecosystem, we expect to see
quantum impact accelerate across every industry.

Superposition enables quantum mechanical effects such as interference, tunneling, and entanglement,
which in turn empower quantum algorithms for faster searching, better
optimization, and greater security.
