User case studies from white papers. 

**Mike** The Traffic optimization section is a good example of how we applied QIO. But the other areas in the white papers are still too broad and too high-level.

Complex optimization problems exist across every industry, such as vehicle routing, supply chain management, portfolio optimization, power grid management, and many others. Optimization algorithms are also at the core of many machine learning methods. These real-world problems are very valuable to solve in order to reduce costs, accelerate processes, or reduce risk. Many real-world optimization problems remain unsolvable by classical computing despite the remarkable advancement in both algorithms and computing power over the past decades.

Quantum computers might be able help solve complex optimization problems, from combinatorial optimization to partial differential equations. Quantum computers can naturally represent random distributions as quantum states, and therefore have the potential to provide better solutions than today’s classical optimization algorithms.

Emulating quantum effects on classical computers has led to the development of new types of quantum solutions that run
on classical hardware, also called quantum-inspired algorithms. These algorithms allow us to exploit some of the advantages of
quantum computing approaches today on classical hardware,providing a speedup over traditional approaches. Using
quantum solutions on classical hardware also prepares us for the future of quantum optimization on actual quantum hardware.

## Application areas

### Traffic optimization

Traffic congestion results in a significant time and cost burden in many metropolitan areas. Another important use
case for vehicle routing is the efficient evacuation of large urban areas.

An example of applying quantum-inspired optimization is to significantly reduce both congestion and travel time. Ford and Microsoft worked together on a solution that showed a more than 70% decrease in congestion, as well as a reduction of
average travel time of approximately 8%  in preliminaries studies with up to 5,000 vehicles and compared to the best routes provided by Bing Maps. 

Traffic optimizations of approximately 400 vehicles takes 20 seconds on a quantum annealing machine. In the case study, the
quantum-inspired algorithms tackle a comparable problem in only 0.02 seconds on a single CPU core. This can be further
accelerated using specialized hardware, such as FPGAs available in Azure, by at least two orders of magnitude, which
enables the speed required to address the scale of real-world routing complexity, well beyond simple toy problems.

In addition to solving complex optimization problems, quantum computers may be able to aid in chemistry and materials development far beyond the capacity of present-day supercomputers. Such simulations could lead to breakthroughs in materials science such as batteries with greater capacity and longer life spans, high temperature superconductors, and new catalysts for converting and optimizing alternative fuel sources. In addition, because of the difficulty of simulating the characteristics of complex molecules, the development of new materials with specific properties—like next-gen batteries—poses huge computational challenges as well. And with quantum breakthroughs in material science, lower emissions and better efficiencies begin to come into focus.
