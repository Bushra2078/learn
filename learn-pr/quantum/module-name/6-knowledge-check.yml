  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Azure Quantum offers two services: quantum computing and optimization solutions. What is the difference between them?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Quantum computing is only for simulating quantum systems like molecules and optimization use quantum computers to solve optimization problems.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quantum computing is not restricted to simulating quantum systems. The optimization solutions don't use quantum computers."
    - content: 'You can use quantum computing to run quantum algorithms in quantum hardware and optimization to solve optimization problems using classical hardware.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Quantum computing consist of running quantum algorithms such as Grover's algorithm in a real or simulated quantum device, while optimizations consists of solving optimization problems using classical computers."
    - content: 'You use quantum computing to run quantum algorithms in quantum hardware and then you use optimization run those algorithms more efficiently.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quantum computing and optimization address different kinds of problems."

  - content: 'Which of the following affirmations about Azure Quantum is **false**?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Simulators, quantum computers, and optimization solvers are examples of targets of Azure Quantum.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This affirmation is correct."
    - content: 'Each job has an ID that must be unique within the workspace.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This affirmation is correct."
    - content: "You can submit jobs without an Azure Storage Account, however it's recommended to have one to keep your results."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This affirmation is false. You must own an Azure storage account in order to create a quantum workspace to submit jobs."

  - content: 'Which of the following sentences about quantum-inspired optimization in Azure Quantum is **true**?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Emulating quantum effects on classical computers has led to the development of new types of quantum solutions that run on classical hardware, also called quantum-inspired algorithms.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This sentence is correct. These algorithms allow us to exploit some of the advantages of quantum computing approaches today on classical hardware. "
    - content: 'Azure Quantum only offers quantum-inspired optimization solutions. For classical optimization, you should look into other Azure products.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This affirmation is false. Azure Quantum also offers many different optimization solvers that aren't quantum inspired."
    - content: 'Quantum-inspired optimization solutions in Azure Quantum are useful for machine learning.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This affirmation is false. Although machine learning problems can often be expressed as optimization problems, Azure Quantum optimization solvers are in general not suitable to solve machine learning problems."
