  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which one of the following statements is false?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Azure Quantum is a cloud hub that provides access to quantum computers in the cloud.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is true. Azure Quantum connects you with an increasing catalog of first-class quantum computing manufacturers."
    - content: 'With Azure Quantum, you can run your Q# programs in trapped ion quantum computers.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is true. You just submitted a Q# program to IonQ's trapped ion quantum computer!"
    - content: 'With Azure Quantum, you can only run algorithms in quantum computers, but for simulations you need them to run locally in your computer.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This statement is false. Azure Quantum also lets you test your Q# programs in different simulators."

  - content: 'A trapped ion quantum computer is:'
    choices:
    - content: 'A quantum computer that uses ions suspended in an electromagnetic field in the vacuum as the basic element to represent qubits.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. These computers use chains of trapped ions and each ion represents a qubit.'
    - content: 'The only existing type of quantum computers to date.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This statement is false. There are other working technologies available today, like superconducting qubit quantum computers.'
    - content: 'A quantum computer that only allows a certain set of transformations that is not universal.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This statement is false. Ion trapped quantum computers allow to apply a universal set of quantum operations.'
      
  - content: 'Which of the following statements is true?'
    choices:
    - content: 'This code *can* run in a target with the No Control Flow profile: `if (M(qubit) == One) { ... }`'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is false. For No Control Flow targets, values of type `Result` don't support equality comparison."
    - content: "This code *can't* run in a target with the Basic Measurement Feedback profile: `if (M(qubit) == One) { X(qubit); }`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This statement is false. For Basic Measurement Feedback targets, values of type `Result` do support equality comparisons as part of conditions within `if` statements in operations.'
    - content: "This code *can't* run in a target with the Basic Measurement Feedback profile: `if (M(qubit) == One) { return M(qubit); }`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This statement is false. Although the Basic Measurement Feedback profile allows for comparison of values of the type `Result` as part of conditions within `if` statements, it doesn't allow to return values within the `if` block."
