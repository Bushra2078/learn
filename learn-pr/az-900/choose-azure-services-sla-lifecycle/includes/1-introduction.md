In this module, you'll learn about Azure's service-level agreements (SLAs) and how they can impact your application design decisions. You'll also learn about the lifecycle of new Azure services &mdash; from the preview phase to becoming generally available.

## Meet Tailwind Traders

## How will moving to the cloud impact Tailwind Traders' availability agreements?

Moving to the cloud removes the burden of supporting IT infrastructure. When network connectivity is lost or a hard drive fails, you rely on the cloud provider to restore service.

Tailwind Traders' IT department hosts applications and services in their datacenter for the rest of the company. The IT department has agreements with other teams in place that state how available those services will be, which includes when and how planned maintenance can happen. As Tailwind Traders moves their workloads to Azure, they no longer have full control over the hardware and networks. How will their agreements around availability be impacted?

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Describe what a service-level agreement (SLA) is and why SLAs are important.
* Identify factors, such as the service tier you choose, that can impact an SLA.
* Combine SLAs to compute a composite SLA.
* Describe the service lifecycle in Azure, including how to access new capabilities that are coming to Azure.
