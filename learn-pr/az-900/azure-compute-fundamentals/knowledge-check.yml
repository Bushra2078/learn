quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which Azure compute resource can be used to deploy to manage a set of identical virtual machines?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machine availability sets"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs within a datacenter that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability."
    - content: "Virtual machine availability zones"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Zones are unique physical locations within a region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking."
    - content: "Virtual machine scale sets"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Virtual machine scale sets let you deploy and manage a set of identical virtual machines."
  - content: "Which of the following services should be used when the primary concern is to perform work in response to an event (often via a REST command) that needs a response in a few seconds?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure App Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. App Service is the blade in Azure where you find Azure Functions."
    - content: "Azure Container Instances"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In this case, you are still running a full application that may not be designed for quick responses to events."
    - content: "Azure Functions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Functions is used when you need to perform work in response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service, and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less."
