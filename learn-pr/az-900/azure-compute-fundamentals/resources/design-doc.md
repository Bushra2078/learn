## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    [Azure compute](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/compute) is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources such as disks, processors, memory, networking and operating systems.

    The resources are available on-demand and can typically be made available in minutes or even seconds. You pay only for the resources you use and only for as long as you're using them.

    There are many compute services two of the most common are: virtual machines and containers.
