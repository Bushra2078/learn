These questions rely on rote memorization.

A stronger set of questions might start by proposing a reference architecture of a workload TWT wants to migrate to Azure.

Then, propose 3 questions around each of these areas.

* TCO
* Pricing / procurement
* Minimizing costs / optimizing usage

Each question should cause the learner to apply what they've learned to the scenario.
