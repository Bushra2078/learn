## What can I do with Azure?

Azure provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines that run in Azure. While migrating your existing apps to virtual machines is a good start, the cloud is more than just "a different place to run your virtual machines".

For example, Azure provides AI and machine-learning services that can naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing, and speech. It also provides storage solutions that dynamically grow to accommodate massive amounts of data. Azure services enable solutions that are not feasible without the power of the cloud.

## What is the Azure portal?

The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription using a graphical user interface. You can build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments. Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources. Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

The Azure portal is designed for resiliency and continuous availability, and maintains a presence in every Azure datacenter. This configuration makes the Azure portal resilient to individual datacenter failures, and avoids network slow-downs by being close to users. The Azure portal updates continuously and requires no downtime for maintenance activities.

## What is Azure Marketplace?

[Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) is a service on Azure that helps connect end users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), and start-ups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure. Azure Marketplace allows customers - mostly IT professionals and cloud developers - to find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers, all certified to run on Azure.

The solution catalog spans several industry categories, including but not limited to: open-source container platforms, virtual machine images, databases, application build and deployment software, developer tools, threat detection, and blockchain. Using Azure Marketplace, you can provision end-to-end solutions quickly and reliably, hosted in your own Azure environment. At the time of writing, this includes over 8,000 listings.

While Azure Marketplace is designed for IT professionals and cloud developers interested in commercial and IT software, Microsoft Partners also use it as a launch point for all joint Go-To-Market activities.
