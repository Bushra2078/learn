In this module, you learned about some of the ways you can secure network traffic both on Azure and in your on-premises datacenter.

*Defense in depth* is the overriding theme. Think about security as a multi-layer, multi-vector concern. Threats come from places we don't expect, and they can come with surprising strength.

Tailwind Trader now has a few tools and services that they can use to secure their networks. Here's a brief summary:

* Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based, network security service that protects resources in your Azure Virtual Networks.
* A Virtual Network (VNet) is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own datacenter. It enables virtual machines and other compute resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
* Azure DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks.
