Every system, architecture, and application needs to be designed with security in mind, whether on-premises or in the cloud. There's too much at risk. For example, a denial of service attack could prevent your customer from reaching your web site or services and block you from doing business. Or, your website could be defaced, causing damage to your reputation. A data breach could be even worse, as it can ruin hard-earned trust, while causing significant personal and financial harm. 

While security must be considered at every layer in your application  (from the physical servers through to the application data), there are factors specifically relevant to the network configuration and network traffic of your cloud-based workloads.  

In this module, we will focus on the network security capabilities in Azure and review how they help you secure your solutions in the cloud, based on your business needs.  

By the end of this module, you will be able to discuss the basic concepts for protecting your cloud workloads at the network layer.
