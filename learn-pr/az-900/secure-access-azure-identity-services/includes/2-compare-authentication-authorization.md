Recall that Tailwind Traders must ensure that only employees can sign in and access their business applications.

Tailwind Traders also needs to ensure that employees can access only authorized applications. For example, all employees can access inventory and pricing software, but only store managers can access payroll and certain accounting software.

Two fundamental concepts you need to understand when talking about identity and access are _authentication_ (AuthN) and _authorization_ (AuthZ).

Authentication and authorization both support everything else that happens and occur sequentially in the identity and access process.

Let's take a brief look at each.

## What is authentication?

Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service looking to access a resource. It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials and provides the basis for creating a security principal for identity and access control use. It establishes whether the user is who they say they are.

## What is authorization?

While authentication establishes the user's identity, authorization is the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has. It specifies what data they're allowed to access and what they can do with it.
