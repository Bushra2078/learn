Two fundamental concepts you need to understand when talking about identity and access are _authentication_ and _authorization_.

Authentication is sometimes shortened to *AuthN* and authorization is sometimes shortened to *AuthZ*. They both support everything else that happens and occur sequentially in the identity and access process.

Let's take a brief look at each.

## What is authentication?

_Authentication_ is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service looking to access a resource. It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials and provides the basis for creating a security principal for identity and access control use. It establishes whether the user is who they say they are.

## What is authorization?

While authentication establishes the user's identity, _authorization_ is the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has. It specifies what data they're allowed to access and what they can do with it.
