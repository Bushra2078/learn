You've been tasked with defining and implementing the governance strategy for Tailwind Traders.

Fulfilling complete cloud governance requires good analysis and requirements gathering. Luckily, there are several services in Azure to support your efforts.

Here are some key points to keep in mind:

* The Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure provides you with proven guidance to help with your cloud adoption journey.
* Cloud governance often starts at the subscription level. Billing, access control, and subscription limits are three top aspects to consider when creating and managing subscriptions.
* Azure RBAC enables you to create roles that define access permissions.
* Resource locks prevent resources from being accidentally deleted or changed.
* Resource tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources.
* Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources.
* Azure Blueprints enables you to define a repeatable set of governance tools and standard Azure resources that your organization requires.

With these points in mind, you're ready to take the next step towards building a good cloud governance strategy.
