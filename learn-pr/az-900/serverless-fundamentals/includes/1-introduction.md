Serverless computing is a term used to describe an execution environment that is set up and managed for you.  You merely specify what you want to happen by writing code or connecting and configuring components in a visual editor, and specify the action that triggers your functionality, like a timer or an HTTP request.  Best of all, you never have to worry about an outage, your code can scale instantly to meet demand, and you only pay based on the actual usage of your code.
