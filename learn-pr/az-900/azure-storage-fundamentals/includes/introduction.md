Suppose your company, Tailwind Traders, has a number of product brochures, datasheets, product images, and other files related that are related to marketing, sales, and support. In the past, your company has been hosting these files on standalone web servers in your data center. Your company is in the process of migrating its applications to the cloud, and your development team is currently architecting new applications.
