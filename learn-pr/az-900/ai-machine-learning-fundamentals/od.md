## ELP and OD info

### AFUN 51

Fundamentals of Azure Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (Theatre Session)

### Abstract

TWT is considering integrating machine learning, cognitive services and Azure Bot Services into future applications. In this session you’ll learn about the scenarios where each of these technologies are appropriate.

### Format

15 minute theater session

### AZ 900 Objectives Covered

- Describe core solutions available on Azure
  - Describe the benefits and usage of (a) Azure Machine Learning, (b) Cognitive Services and (c) Azure Bot Service


## Problems addressed

How does TWT understand the use cases for machine learning, cognitive services and Azure Bot Service?

### Demonstrations

Demonstration of a BOT responding to TWT Frequently Asked Questions

### Notes

Put this into a theatre session because it didn’t really wedge in anywhere else and we have limited space.
This session provides conceptual information. Practical information will be addressed in the AIML track (or its equivalent).

**Need to determine if this is a module or part of another module**
