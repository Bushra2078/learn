Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a category of computing that performs analysis and performs decision making based on a set of rules or large sets of data.  Microsoft Azure provides several different AI solutions to choose from, depending on the problem you're trying to solve.

Tailwind Traders, a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer who has found success selling online, is now considering integrating machine learning, cognitive services and Azure Bot Services into future web and mobile applications. 

They have an immediate need to add a chatbot to their website and mobile app. It should be able to respond to a list of frequently asked questions.

However, they also struggle with other challenges that could potentially be solved by using other AI services.

In this module you will create an application that accepts user input from the keyboard, combine that input with hard-coded text, and present the final result back to the user. Youâ€™ll learn some initial concepts like basic C# syntax including several common operators, the string data type and how to create literal strings, how to initialize variables then set and retrieve values from a variable, why you would want to comment out a line of code, how your code is structured into classes and methods and how to call methods.

By the end of this module, you will be able to build simple applications that can accept user input, combine that input with literal text, and output the result to the user.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:
  - Discover the Azure's Artificial Intelligence services like Machine Learning, Cognitive Services and Bot Service.
  - Choose the correct Artifical Intelligence service to address different kinds of business challenges.
  - Build a bot using QnA Maker that harnesses the power of both Cognitive Services and Bot Service.
