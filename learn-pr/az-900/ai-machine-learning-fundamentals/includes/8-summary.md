Our goal in this module was to help Tailwind Traders explore different Artificial Intelligence (AI) service offerings from Azure to apply to different business opportunities.

We identified different product options and their capabilities, including Azure Bot Services, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Machine Learning. We analyzed decision criteria for choosing one option over another in a given scenario.  Then we applied that decision criteria to three different initiatives in Tailwind Traders, helping them find the best service option for the given scenario.

Without AI services, Tailwind Traders would spend more time and effort on manual tasks, respond to customers less quickly, offer weak product recommendations, and be unable to fully support customers who speak different languages.

Artificial intelligence is one area that could literally transform every area of a business and is limited only by the creativity and imagination of the organization.
