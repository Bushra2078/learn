Our goal in this module was to help Tailwind Traders review different Artificial Intelligence (AI) service offerings from Azure.  Their immediate need was to build a bot that could servce customers to their website by helping them quickly locate the information they're looking for based on a long list of Frequently Asked Questions that the company has collected.  Our secondary goal was to help Tailwind Traders identify how AI could be used to improve different areas of their business.

By using QnA Maker, and by extension, Cognitive Services and the Bot Framework, Tailwind Traders was able to respond to customer inquiries more quickly and accurately, and customer service agents can spend more time helping customers with special circumstances or more specialized and infrequently asked questions.  By discovering Azure's AI services, Tailwind Traders can find improve operations across the board, from sales to support to purchasing to operations.

Without AI services, Tailwind Traders would spend more time and effort on manual tasks, respond to customers less quickly, and more.

AI services is one area that could literally transform every area of a business and is limited only by the creativity and imagination of the organization.
