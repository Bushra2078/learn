Our goal in this module was to help Tailwind Traders explore different Artificial Intelligence (AI) service offerings from Azure to apply to different business opportunities.



By using QnA Maker, and by extension, Cognitive Services and the Bot Framework, Tailwind Traders was able to respond to customer inquiries more quickly and accurately, and customer service agents can spend more time helping customers with special circumstances or more specialized and infrequently asked questions.  By discovering Azure's AI services, Tailwind Traders can find improve operations across the board, from sales to support to purchasing to operations.

Without AI services, Tailwind Traders would spend more time and effort on manual tasks, respond to customers less quickly, and more.

AI services is one area that could literally transform every area of a business and is limited only by the creativity and imagination of the organization.
