Tailwind Traders wants to implement a touchless point-of-sale solution for self-checkout.  These self-checkout terminals should be, above all else, secure. Each terminal must be impervious to malicious code that could create fraudulent transactions, force the company to take the systems offline during a heavy shopping period, or send transactional data to a spying organization.  The terminals should also report back vital information on their health and allow secure updates to their software remotely.

After reviewing many possible solutions during a Request For Proposal process, they decided they needed features that vendors have yet to implement. Instead of using an existing solution, Tailwind Traders decides to work with a leading engineering firm that specializes in IoT solutions. This approach will allow them to build a uniquely secure terminal that gives them the retail platform to build on going forward.

While most of their focus is on the terminal itself, they realize they want a solution that can help them make sense of all the data that will be generated by these terminals across all of their retail stores, and an easy way to push software updates to their terminals.

## Which service should we choose?

Here again, let's apply the decision criteria from a previous unit.

Is it critical to ensure that the device, in this case, each point-of-sale terminal, is not compromised?  Absolutely.  Device security is the primary requirement.

Next, do they need a dashboard for reporting and management?  Yes, a reporting and management dashboard is a requirement from Tailwind Traders.

So, given the responses to the decision criteria, the IoT engineering firm will build a platform on top of both Azure IoT Central and Azure Sphere.  Even though there's no specific starter template available in Azure IoT Central designed for this scenario, it can be easily adapted to accommodate the kinds of reports they want to see and management operations they want to perform.

## Why not choose IoT Hub?

Actually, by using IoT Central, Tailwind Traders would be using IoT Hub behind the scenes as well.
