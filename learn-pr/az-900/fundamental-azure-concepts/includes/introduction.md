You work in the IT deparment for Tailwind Traders, which has decided to migrate their applications and data to the cloud. However, some of the cloud computing concepts are new to many of your IT staff members, and they've been asking some specific questions about what cloud computing can do for them. For example, the team that manages Tailwind Traders' website would like to know how Azure will improve their availability and scalability, whereas the team that handles the deployment of new hardware is curious to see how cloud computing can make their deployment processes faster. In addition, your developer team would like to learn about the different options that will be available to them as they are designing new applications. For example, is there a way to run their applications in a hybrid configuration - where part of their application runs on premisis and the rest of the application runs in the cloud?
