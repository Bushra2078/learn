In this module, you learned how Tailwind Traders can take advantage of several clouding computing features, which will help them reduce their overall computing costs. You examined several of the benefits that clouding computing provides - such as high availability, scalability, and geographic distribution - and you compared the differences between capital expenses and operating expenses in a cloud computing scenario. Lastly, you learned about the different categories (Iaas, Paas, Saas) and types (public, private, and hybrid) of cloud computing. Armed with this new knowledge, you can help Tailwind Traders migrate successfully to Azure.
