## What are some cloud computing advantages?

There are several benefits that a cloud environment has over a physical environment. For example, cloud-based applications employ a myriad of related strategies:

- **High Availability** - depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud[based applications can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime even when things go wrong

- **Scalability** - applications in the cloud can be scaled two ways:

   - *Vertically* - computing capacity can be increased by adding additional RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine
   - *Horizontally* - computing capacity can be increased by adding instances of a resource, such as adding additional virtual machines to your configuration

- **Elasticity** - cloud-based applications can be configured to take advantage of autoscaling, so your applications will always have the resources they need

- **Agility** - cloud-based resources can be deployed and configured quickly as your application requirements change

- **Geo-distribution** - applications and data can be deployed to regional data centers around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region

- **Disaster Recovery** - by taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your applications with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event that disaster should occur
