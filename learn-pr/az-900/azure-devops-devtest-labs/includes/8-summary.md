Our goal in this module was to help Tailwind Traders choose the best DevOps solution for a given set of requirements across different software development and testing needs.

We identified different product options and their capabilities, including Azure DevOps Services, GitHub (including GitHub Actions), and Azure DevTest Labs.  We analyzed the decision criteria for choosing one option over another in a given scenario.  Then we applied that decision criteria to three different challenges at Tailwind Traders, helping them find the best service option for the given scenario.

Without software development services and tools from Microsoft, Tailwind Traders might have difficulty in realizing the benefits of DevOps practices like CI/CD, source code management, and work item management.

DevOps practices and processes have changed the software development landscape, accelerating software development while improving the deployability and quality of software systems. The wealth of tools from Microsoft can help organizations implement DevOps practices and experience better collaboration between and consistent results from technical teams.
