Our goal in this module was to be able to choose the best DevOps solution for a given set of requirements.

[How the tech solved the problem]

By using basic C# syntax, the dotnet CLI, the Console class in the .NET Base Class Library and several developer tools already installed into the Azure Cloud Shell, we were able to ask the user to enter their name, store it in a variable and combine it with literal string data to display a new message.

[Experience without product]


[Business impact]

While our application may seem mundane as modern games go, most applications will perform these same basic features, including:
Displaying output to a user
Requesting input from a user
Processing information -- combining it, formatting it, calculating it, etc.
