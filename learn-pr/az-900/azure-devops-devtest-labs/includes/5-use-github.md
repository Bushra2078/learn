## What's the opportunity?

Tailwind Traders hopes to publish an API that would allow third-parties to integrate their own inventories of new and used items that would allow Tailwind Traders to offer a wider variety of products directly from their ecommerce site.

While the internal implementation of the API is closed source, Tailwind Traders wants to create a set of examples that call the API to perform various actions.  They would use this as a means of collecting feedback on the API, issue reporting, and building a community around feature requests.

### Which product option to choose?

Developers are generally used to seeing this kind of content available on GitHub.  With GitHub, Tailwind Traders can publish their code, accept community contributions to improve the code examples, accept feedback and bug reports, and more.

### Why not choose Azure DevOps?

While Azure DevOps could be used to make the repository public, some of the other features that involve the development community like feedback, bug reports, and so on would be less accessible.

### Why not choose Azure DevTest Labs?

For this scenario, Azure DevTest Labs is not a candidate since it does not have work management and reporting features.
