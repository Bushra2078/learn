- Shared Source Code Repository
- Project management, including Kanboan boards

With so many similar features to Azure DevOps, you might wonder which to choose for your organization.  Unfortunately, the answer to this question may not be straightforward.

While both Azure DevOps and GitHub both allow public and private code repositories, GitHub has a long and trusted history with public repositories and is trusted by tens of thousands of open source projects.


### Azure DevTest Labs

Azure DevTest Labs provides an automated means of managing the process of building, setting up, and tearing down Virtual Machines containing builds of your software projects so that developers and testers can perform tests across different environments and builds. 

Suppose you need to test a new feature on an old version of an operating system.  Azure DevTest Labs can set everything up automatically upon request.  Once the testing is complete, DevTest Labs can shut down and deprovision the VM to save money when not in use.
