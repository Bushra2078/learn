A *service-level agreement* (SLA) is a formal agreement between a service company and the customer.

On Azure, this agreement defines the performance standards that Microsoft commits to for you, the customer.

In this part, you'll learn:

* Why SLAs are important.
* Where you can find the SLA for a specific Azure service.
* What you'll find in a typical SLA.
* What we mean by terms like "three nines" and "four nines" availability, and how these percentages relate to total downtime.
* How credits are applied when a service fails to perform to its specification.

## Where can I access SLAs for Azure services?

You can access SLAs from the [Service Level Agreements](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/?azure-portal=true) page on azure.microsoft.com.

Each Azure service defines its own SLA. Azure services are organized by category.

Open the SLA for Azure Database for MySQL, a managed database that makes it easy for developers to work with MySQL databases. You'll refer back to this SLA in a moment.

To do so:

1. Go to [Service Level Agreements](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/?azure-portal=true).
1. From the **Databases** category, select **Azure Database for MySQL**.

## What's in a typical SLA?

A typical SLA breaks down into these sections:

* **Introduction**

    This section explains what to expect in this SLA, including its scope and how subscription renewals can impact the terms.
* **General Terms**

    This section contains terms that are used throughout the SLA so that both parties (you and Microsoft) have a consistent vocabulary. For example, this section might define what's meant by downtime, incidents, error codes, and success codes.

    This section also defines the general terms of the agreement, including how to submit a claim, receive credit for any performance or availability issues, and limitations of the agreement.
* **SLA details**

    This section defines the specific guarantees for the service. Performance commitments are commonly measured as a percentage. That percentage typically ranges from 99.9% ("three nines") to 99.99% ("four nines").

    The primary performance commitment typically focuses on *uptime*, or the percentage of time that a product or service is successfully operational. Some SLAs focus on other factors as well, including *latency*, or how fast the service must respond to a request.

    This section also defines any additional terms that are specific to this service.

Take a moment to review the SLA for Azure Database for MySQL.

You see that this SLA focuses mainly on uptime. Azure Database for MySQL guarantees 99.99%, or "four nines", uptime. This means that the service is guaranteed to be running and available to process requests 99.99% of the time.

## How do percentages relate to total downtime?

*Downtime* refers to the time duration that the service is unavailable.

The difference between 99.9% and 99.99% might seem minor, but it's important to understand what these numbers mean in terms of total downtime.

Here's a table to give you a sense of how total downtime decreases as the SLA percentage increases from 99% to 99.999%:

| SLA percentage | Downtime per week | Downtime per month | Downtime per year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 99 |1.68 hours |7.2 hours |3.65 days |
| 99.9 |10.1 minutes |43.2 minutes |8.76 hours |
| 99.95 |5 minutes |21.6 minutes |4.38 hours |
| 99.99 |1.01 minutes |4.32 minutes |52.56 minutes |
| 99.999 |6 seconds |25.9 seconds |5.26 minutes |

These amounts are cumulative, which means that the duration of multiple different service outages would be combined, or added together.

## What are service credits?

A *service credit* is the percentage of the fees you paid that's credited back to you according to Microsoft's claim approval process.

An SLA describes how Microsoft responds when an Azure service fails to perform to its specification. For example, you may receive a discount on your Azure bill as compensation when a service fails to perform according to its SLA.

Credits typically increase as uptime decreases. Here's how credits are applied for Azure Database for MySQL according to uptime:

| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit |
| --- | --- |
| < 99.99% | 10% |
| < 99% | 25% |
| < 95% | 100% |

Now we have explored how service-level agreements are structured, lets take a look at some other factors that Tailwind Traders needs to consider, that might impact those SLA performance targets.

## What's the SLA for free services?

Free products typically do not have an SLA.

For example, many Azure services provide a *Free* or *Shared* tier that provides more limited functionality. Services like Azure Advisor are always free.
