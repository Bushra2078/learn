A common concern for customers new to cloud is whether the availability of those cloud products and services is guaranteed. As you no longer have access to monitor, maintain or respond to incidents with the underlying cloud datacenter infrastructure, you're relying on the cloud provider to keep those components running. 

Tailwind Traders' internal IT department manages technology services and solutions for the rest of the Tailwind Traders organization. It has internal agreements in place that state how available those solutions will be, that also allow for regular, planned maintenance. If Tailwind Traders move some workloads to Azure, will those internal agreements be impacted, as Tailwind Traders no longer has full control of the hardware and networks?    

In this module, you will learn about Azure's Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and how they apply to different Azure resources. We will explore how SLAs are calculated when your solution includes different types of products and services and how they can be impacted by your solution design decisions. Finally, we will look at lifecycle of a new Azure product or feature, which may have a  different Service Level Agreement when it is first released.
