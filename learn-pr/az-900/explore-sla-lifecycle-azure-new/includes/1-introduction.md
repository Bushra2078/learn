In this module, you'll learn about Azure's service-level agreements (SLAs) and how they apply to different Azure resources. We will explore how SLAs are calculated when your solution includes different types of products and services and how they can be impacted by your solution design decisions. Finally, we will look at lifecycle of a new Azure product or feature, which may have a different service-level agreement when it is first released.

## Meet Tailwind Traders

## How will moving to the cloud impact availability agreements?

Moving to the cloud removes the burden of supporting IT infrastructure. When network connectivity is lost or a hard drive fails, you rely on the cloud provider to restore service.

Tailwind Traders' IT department hosts applications and services in their datacenter for the rest of the company. The IT department has agreements in place that state how available those services will be, which includes when and how planned maintenance can happen. As Tailwind Traders moves their workloads to Azure, Tailwind Traders no longer has full control of the hardware and networks. How will their agreements around availability be impacted?

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Describe what a service-level agreement (SLA) is and why SLAs are important.
* Identify factors, such as the service tier you choose, that can impact an SLA.
* Combine SLAs to compute a composite SLA.
* Describe the service lifecycle in Azure, including how preview features move to general availability.
