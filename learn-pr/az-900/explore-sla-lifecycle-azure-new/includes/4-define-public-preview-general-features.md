Azure services have a lifecycle.  Azure services start in the development phase. Next they are released to preview, to inform you new features are coming. Then the services release to public testing, so you can experiment with them.  Finally the service becomes available to everyone.  Services Lifecycle in Azure is the name of this release cycle.  Over the next few minutes we'll explore the value of service lifecycles.

> ### Contoso Shipping case study
>
> Contoso Shipping is experimenting with a custom drone delivery system for rural areas.  They really want the ability to use some real-time storm tracking in the guidance system, but the feature is not ready yet.  The Azure Blog says that a AI Storm Analyzer has just entered preview.  How can Contoso Shipping see if this might be the capability they need.

In this module, you'll define what a preview feature is, and explore how and when you should use it.



Microsoft offers previews of Azure services, features, and functionality for evaluation purposes.  With *Azure Previews*, you can test pre-release features, products, services, software, and even regions. Previews allow users early access to functionality.  Additionally, users providing feedback on the preview features helps Microsoft improve the Azure service.

## Categories

There are two categories of preview that are available:

+ **Preview feature** - An Azure feature is available to *certain* Azure customers for evaluation purposes.

+ **Public preview** - An Azure feature is available to *all* Azure customers for evaluation purposes.

## Azure Preview Terms and Conditions

Azure feature previews are available with their own terms and conditions.  The terms and conditions are specific to each Azure preview. All preview-specific terms and conditions supplement your existing Azure service agreement.

> There's a [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms?azure-portal=true) page.

## General availability

Once a feature is evaluated and tested successfully, it may release to customers as part of Azure.

In other words, the feature may be made available for all Azure customers. A feature released to all Azure customers typically goes to *General Availability* or *GA*.

The above image outlines the general process for features and bugs during the development lifecycle. It's common for features to move from Azure preview features to GA, based on customer evaluation and feedback.
