Azure services have a lifecycle which charts how they are released for public use, known as the Services Lifecycle.  Azure services start in the development phase. Next they are released to preview, to inform you new features are coming. Then the services release to public testing, so you can experiment with them.  Finally the service becomes available to everyone.

In this module, you'll learn about previews and general availability, as defined in the Services Lifecycle.

## Azure Previews
Microsoft offers early opportunities for you to evaluate new Azure services, features and functionality. With *Azure Previews*, you can test pre-release features, products, services, software, and even regions. Additionally, when you provide feedback on these previews, you're helping Microsoft improve their Azure services.

### Categories

There are two categories of preview that are available:

+ **Preview feature** - An Azure feature that is available to *certain* selected Azure customers, for evaluation purposes.

+ **Public preview** - An Azure feature that is available to *all* Azure customers for evaluation purposes.

### Azure Preview Terms and Conditions

Azure feature previews have their own terms and conditions.  The terms and conditions are specific to each Azure preview. All preview-specific terms and conditions supplement your existing Azure service agreement.

There's a [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms?azure-portal=true) page.

> [!NOTE]
> Some previews are not covered by customer support. Previews are not recommended for business-critical workloads. 

### Tailwind Traders experimental application

Tailwind Traders is experimenting with a custom drone delivery system for customers in rural areas.  They really want the ability to use real-time storm tracking in the drone guidance system, but the feature is not ready yet.  The Azure Blog says that a AI Storm Analyzer has just entered public preview, so Tailwind Traders has decided to incorporate it into the early stages of their application testing.

## General availability
Once a feature is evaluated and tested successfully, it may release to all customers as a production-ready service. This is known as *General Availability* or *GA*.

The graphic below show the general process for features (and bugs) during their development lifecycle. It's common for features to move from being an Azure preview feature to GA, based on customer evaluation and feedback.
