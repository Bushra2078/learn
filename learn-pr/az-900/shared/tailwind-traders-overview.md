Tailwind Traders specializes in competitive pricing, fast shipping, and a large range of items. They're looking at cloud technologies to improve business operations and support growth into new markets. By moving to the cloud, they plan to enhance their shopping experience to further differentiate themselves from their competitors.

To do that, they'll first move some IT workloads from their on-premises datacenter to Azure, while ensuring they adhere to their security and compliance needs. Then they'll explore what's available to build solutions directly in the cloud to support their business growth. Finally, they'll investigate how cloud technologies such as machine learning, augmented reality, and interactive chat bots can provide a truly world-class shopping experience for their customers, both online and in their stores.
