TODO: In this part, ...

TODO: As a learner, I saw some compliance offerings, the Privacy policy, the OST and the DPA. The Trust Center feels like more words about the same things. How can we more strongly differentiate the TC from what we've discussed so far? How does this relate to TWT?

Also, is this the same things we're talking about in unit 2? If so, should we combine the two?

The [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter?azure-portal=true) showcases Microsoft's principles for maintaining data integrity in the cloud and how Microsoft implements and supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in all Microsoft cloud products and services. The Trust Center is an important part of the Microsoft Trusted Cloud Initiative and provides support and resources for the legal and compliance community.

The Trust Center provides:

* In-depth information about security, privacy, compliance offerings, policies, features, and practices across Microsoft cloud products.
* Additional resources for each topic.
* Links to the security, privacy, and compliance blogs and upcoming events.

The Trust Center is a great resource for other people in your organization who may play a role in security, privacy, and compliance. These people include business managers, risk assessment and privacy officers, and legal compliance teams.

## Explore the Trust Center

As an optional exercise, let's take a brief look at the Trust Center's entry for ISO 27001, a commonly-used information security standard.

Access to the Trust Center doesn't require an Azure subscription or a Microsoft account.

1. Go to the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter?azure-portal=true).
1. Locate the **Additional resources** section on the page. Under **Compliance offerings**, select **Learn more**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-trust-center-compliance.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the compliance offerings section on the trust center.":::

    You're taken to [Microsoft compliance offerings](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/offering-home?azure-portal=true).

    Note that the offerings are grouped into these categories: **Global**, **US Government**, **Industry**, and **Regional**.

1. Under **Global**, select **ISO 27001**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-iso-27001.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Microsoft compliance offerings page. The global category is shown, and ISO 27001 is highlighted.":::

    The ISO 27001 Information Security Management Standards page is typical of the type of compliance information we provide.

1. Briefly review the documentation for ISO/IEC 27001.

    You see:

    * An overview of the standard.
    * Which cloud services are in scope.
    * An overview of the audit cycle.
    * Answers to frequently asked questions.
    * Additional resources and white papers.
