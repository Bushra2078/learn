Tailwind Traders is used to having total control of all of their application data, stored on servers at their own locations. Knowing that moving an application to the cloud means that data is now outside of their own walls, and understanding that the cloud provider has access to the server hardware and infrastructure, how is the privacy of their application data protected?

To answer this question, you'll start with the three main sources that detail Microsoft's approach to privacy and data protection.  

## Microsoft Privacy Statement

The [Microsoft privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement?azure-portal=true) explains what personal data Microsoft collects, how Microsoft uses it, and for what purposes.

The privacy statement covers all of Microsoft's services, websites, apps, software, servers and devices - like server products in enterprises worldwide, devices you use in your home, software that students use at school, and services developers use to create and host whatâ€™s next.

There are also product-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional relevant information.

## Online Services Terms
The Online Services Terms (OST) is a legal agreement between Microsoft and the customer, that details the obligations by both parties with respect to the processing and security of customer data and personal data, specifically by Microsoft's Online Services. This includes services like Azure, Dynamics 365, Office 365, Bing Maps and others, that the customer is using a subscription license for.  

## Data Protection Addendum
The Online Services Data Protection Addendum (DPA) further defines the data processing and security terms for online services. These include:
+ Compliance with laws
+ Disclosure of processed data
+ Processing of personal data in accordance with GDPR (the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation)
+ Data Security: Security practices and policies, data encryption, data access, customer responsibilities and auditing compliance     
+ Data transfers, retention and deletion

It's important that a cloud provider is transparent about their privacy policies and how they treat your data. These three main sources detail Microsoft's commitment to protecting data and privacy in the cloud.
