In this part, you learn how the Microsoft Privacy Statement, the Online Services Terms, and the Data Protection Addendum explain what personal data Microsoft collects, how Microsoft uses it, and for what purposes.

For Tailwind Traders, understanding Microsoft's commitment to privacy helps ensure that their customer and application data will be protected.

Let's begin with a brief look at the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

## What's in the Microsoft Privacy Statement?

The [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement?azure-portal=true) explains what personal data Microsoft collects, how Microsoft uses it, and for what purposes.

The privacy statement covers all of Microsoft's services, websites, apps, software, servers, and devices. This list ranges from enterprise and server products to devices that you use in your home to software that students use at school.

Microsoft's privacy statement also provides additional information that's relevant to specific products such as Windows and Xbox.

## What is the Online Services Terms?

The [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForallOnlineServices?azure-portal=true) (OST) is a legal agreement between Microsoft and the customer. The OST details the obligations by both parties with respect to the processing and security of customer data and personal data. The OST applies specifically to Microsoft's online services that you license through a subscription, including Azure, Dynamics 365, Office 365, and Bing Maps.

## What is the Data Protection Addendum?

The [Data Protection Addendum](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=67&azure-portal=true) (DPA) further defines the data processing and security terms for online services. These terms include:

* Compliance with laws.
* Disclosure of processed data.
* Processing of personal data following the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
* Data Security, which includes security practices and policies, data encryption, data access, customer responsibilities, and compliance with auditing.
* Data transfer, retention, and deletion.

Transparency is important when it comes to how a cloud provider communicates its privacy policies and how it treats your data. The Microsoft Privacy Statement, the OST, and the DPA detail Microsoft's commitment to protecting data and privacy in the cloud.
