Every application and service, whether on-premises or in the cloud, needs to be designed with security in mind. There's too much at risk. For example, a denial of service attack might prevent customers from reaching your website or services and block you from doing business. Or, your website could be defaced, causing damage to your reputation. A data breach would be even worse, as it can ruin hard-earned trust while causing significant personal and financial harm.

## Meet Tailwind Traders

## How will Tailwind Traders secure their networks?

As Tailwind Traders moves to the cloud, they need to evaluate their security needs before they can deploy a single line of code to production.

While security must be considered at every layer in their applications (all the way from the physical servers to the application data), there are factors that relate specifically to the network configuration and network traffic of their cloud-based workloads.

In this module, you'll focus on the network security capabilities in Azure and review how they help you secure your solutions in the cloud, based on your business needs.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll able to:

* Identify the various layers that make up a *defense in depth* strategy.
* Explain how Azure Firewall enables you to control what traffic is allowed on the network.
* Configure network security groups to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources within a Microsoft Azure Virtual Network.
* Explain how Azure DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks.

## Prerequisites

- You should be familiar with basic computing concepts and terminology
- You should be familiar with cloud computing is helpful, but isn't necessary
