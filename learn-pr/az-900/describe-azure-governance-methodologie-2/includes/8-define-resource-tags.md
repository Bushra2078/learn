## Resource tags

Organizing your cloud-based resources can make management tasks and reporting significantly easier. As well as the ability to place related resources into resource groups and subscriptions, you can define and implement resource tags to provide extra information about a resource, that's relevant to your organization. This "metadata" is useful for:

+ **Resource management** - Locating and acting on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, ownership or other important information.
+ **Cost management and optimization** - Grouping resources for cost reporting, internal cost center allocation, budget tracking and alerting, and estimated cost forecasting.
+ **Operations management** - Grouping resources according to how critical their availability is to your business, for SLA visibility.
+ **Security** - Tagging resources related to the classification of the data they hold and the security level of that data (such as public or confidential).
+ **Governance and regulatory compliance** - Choosing a tagging pattern that aligns with any governance or regulatory compliance requirements. This can be used to identify resources that must comply to a particular standard (such as ISO27001), or the tag can be part of your standards enforcement (such as all resources must be tagged with an owner name).   
+ **Workload optimization and automation** - Tagging resources with their associated workload or application name can make it easier to visualize all resources across a complex solution and act on those resources with tools like Azure DevOps.
