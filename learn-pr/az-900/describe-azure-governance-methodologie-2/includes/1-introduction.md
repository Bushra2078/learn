The term _governance_ describes the general process of establishing rules and policies and ensuring that those rules and policies are enforced.

When running in the cloud, a good governance strategy helps you maintain control over the applications and resources that you manage in the cloud. Maintaining control over your environment ensures that you stay compliant with:

* Industry standards, like [PCI DSS](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/offering-pci-dss?view=o365-worldwide?azure-portal=true).
* Corporate or organizational standards, such as ensuring that network data is encrypted.

Governance is most beneficial when you have:

* Multiple engineering teams working in Azure.
* Multiple subscriptions to manage.
* Regulatory requirements that must be enforced.
* Standards that must be followed for all cloud resources.

## Meet Tailwind Traders

[!include[](../../shared/tailwind-traders-overview.md)]

## How will Tailwind Traders improve agility while maintaining control?

Tailwind Traders is continuing their migration to the cloud. For their existing datacenter, development and test teams must submit support tickets to request access to virtual machines, storage, and networking components. It can take IT staff up to two weeks to purchase and provision these components.

Going forward, Tailwind Traders could enforce standards that prevent teams from directly creating resources on Azure, similar to their existing approach. However, they already know that this reduces team agility and the ability to innovate.

In this module, you'll help the team explore ways they can enforce standards while still enabling teams to create and manage the cloud resources they need.

## Learning Objectives

TODO: In this module, you will:

* Learn how the Cloud Adoption Framework can help you make organizational decisions about your cloud environment.
* Learn how role-based security can fine-tune access to your resources.
* Apply tags to add metadata to your Azure resources, for configuration control and reporting.
* Lock resources to prevent accidental deletion 
* Apply policies to control and audit resource creation.
* Apply governance at scale across multiple subscriptions.
