In this unit, you'll analyze the criteria experts employ when choosing an Azure artificial intelligence (AI) service for a given business need.  Understanding the criteria can also help you better understand the nuanced differences between each product.

## Do you need an analysis of how you're using Azure in order to reduce costs?  Improve resilience?  Harden your security?

Choose Azure Advisor when you are looking for an analysis of your deployed resources.  Azure Advisor analyzes your configuration and usage of your resources and provides suggestions on how to optimize for reliability, security, performance, costs, and operations based on expert best practices.

## Do you want to monitor Azure's services or your usage of Azure?

If you want to keep tabs on Azure itself, especially those services and regions you depend on, you want to visit Azure Service Health.  You'll see the current status of those Azure services you rely on, upcoming planned outages, and services that will be sunlit.  You can set up alerts so you can stay on top of incidents and upcoming downtime without visiting the dashboard on a regular basis.

However, if you want to keep track of the performance or issues related to your specific VM or container instances, databases, your applications, etc. then you want to visit Azure Monitor and create reports and notifications to help you understand how your services are performing or diagnose issues related to your specific usage of Azure.

## Do you want to measure custom events along side other usage metrics?

Choose Azure Monitor when you want to measure custom events along side other collected telemetry data.  Custom events, like those added in the source code of your software applications, could help identify and diagnose why your application is behaving a certain way.

## Do you need to set up alerts for outages or when autoscaling is about to deploy new instances?

Here again, you would use Azure Monitor to set up alerts for key events related to your specific resources.
