Tailwind Traders currently manages several websites on-premises that use the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). As part of your planning for your migration strategy, the different teams at Tailwind Traders have been researching the available service offerings that Azure provides. You've already discovered that Azure Web Apps provides built in functionality to create web applications that use PHP on a Linux server running Apache, and you've been tasked with investigating whether the database needs for the web development team will continue to be met after the migration to Azure.

The good news is, the Azure Database for MySQL is a relational database service in the Microsoft cloud, which is based on the MySQL Community Edition database engine, versions 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0. Azure's industry leading 99.99% availability service level agreement (SLA), powered by a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters, helps keep your app running 24/7. With every Azure Database for MySQL server, you take advantage of built-in security, fault tolerance, and data protection that you would otherwise have to buy or design, build, and manage. With Azure Database for MySQL, you can use point-in-time restore to recover a server to an earlier state, as far back as 35 days.

Azure Database for MySQL delivers:

- Built-in high availability with no additional cost.
- Predictable performance, using inclusive pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Scale as needed within seconds.
- Secured to protect sensitive data at-rest and in-motion.
- Automatic backups and point-in-time-restore for up to 35 days.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance.

These capabilities require almost no administration and all are provided at no additional cost. They allow you to focus on rapid app development and accelerating your time to market rather than allocating precious time and resources to managing virtual machines and infrastructure. In addition, you can continue to develop your application with the open-source tools and platform of your choice to deliver with the speed and efficiency your business demands, all without having to learn new skills.

The Azure Database for MySQL service offers several service tiers, and each tier offers different performance and capabilities to support lightweight to heavyweight database workloads. You can build your first app on a small database for a few dollars a month, and then adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You only pay for the resources you need, and only when you need them.
