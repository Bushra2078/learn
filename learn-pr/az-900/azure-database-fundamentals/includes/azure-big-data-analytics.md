Several years ago, Tailwind Traders rolled out a new GPS tracking system for all of their delivery vehicles, which provides real-time tracking data to your primary datacenter. Your CTO would like your team to look at several years of tracking data in order to determine trends, such as a spike in deliveries around the holidays that would require hiring additional headcount. Through an in-depth analysis of the tracking data that you've recorded, your CTO would like predict when changes are necessary and proactively take the steps that are necessary to manage spikes appropriately.

Data comes in all types of forms and formats. When we talk about big data, we're referring to *large* volumes of data. In this Tailwind Traders scenario, data is collected from the GPS sensors, which includes location information, data from weather systems, and many other sources that generate large amounts of data. This amount of data becomes increasingly hard to make sense of and make decisions around. The volumes are so large that traditional forms of processing and analysis are no longer appropriate. 

Open source cluster technologies have been developed, over time, to try to deal with these large data sets. Microsoft Azure supports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions. Some of the most common big data and analytic service types in Azure are Azure Synapse Analytics, HDInsight, Databricks, and Data Lake Analytics.

## Azure Synapse Analytics

[Azure Synapse Analytics]( https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/?azure-portal=true) (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse) is a limitless analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics. Azure Synapse gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless or provisioned resources at scale. Azure Synapse brings these two worlds together with a unified experience to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.

## Azure HDInsight

[Azure HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/?azure-portal=true) is a fully managed, open-source analytics service for enterprises. It is a cloud service that makes it easier, faster, and more cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. HDInsight allows you to run popular open-source frameworks and create cluster types such as [Apache Spark](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-overview?azure-portal=true), [Apache Hadoop](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction?azure-portal=true), [Apache Kafka](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/kafka/apache-kafka-introduction?azure-portal=true), [Apache HBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-overview?azure-portal=true), [Apache Storm](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/storm/apache-storm-overview?azure-portal=true), [Machine Learning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/r-server/r-server-overview?azure-portal=true). HDInsight also supports a broad range of scenarios such as extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL); data warehousing; machine learning; and IoT.

## Azure Data Lake Analytics

[Azure Data Lake Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-lake-analytics/?azure-portal=true) is an on-demand analytics job service that simplifies big data. Instead of deploying, configuring, and tuning hardware, you write queries to transform your data and extract valuable insights. The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by setting the dial for how much power you need. You only pay for your job when it is running, making it more cost-effective.
