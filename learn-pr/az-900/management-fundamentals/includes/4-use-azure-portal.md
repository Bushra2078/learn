Tailwind Traders uses Azure extensively throughout their entire organization. To make sure both the technical team and the executive team is aware of their cloud spend, the director of cloud operations will begin to meet weekly with the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to talk about their cloud spend. Conversations may begin at a high level, but the two may want to dive in deep during the meeting to gain more insight on how Azure resources are being used. Ideally, they would be able to see the data displayed visually, but also be able to run custom reports in real time.  Which tool can they use during their meeting?

## Which service should we choose?

Let's apply the decision criteria we learned about in the previous unit to find the right option.

First, in this scenario, does Tailwind Traders need to perform one-off management / administrative / reporting actions?  Yes, and given the requirement to view data visually and create custom reports during the meeting, the Azure Portal is the best choice.  The meeting attendees can quickly find answers to questions that they're looking for using a wealth of reporting options.

The next two decision criteria do not apply to this scenario since the director of cloud operations and the CFO will not be deploying or configuring any resources.

The Azure Portal is the correct product option for this scenario.
