Integrating external components with Azure Synapse Pipelines refers to the process of connecting to and interacting with external systems, services, and applications from within Azure Synapse Pipelines. This allows data engineers to create data integration workflows that move data between different systems and perform data transformations, regardless of where the data is stored or how it is generated. 

There are several ways to integrate external components with Azure Synapse Pipelines:

- **Linked Services:** Azure Synapse Pipelines provides a variety of built-in linked services that allow you to connect to different types of data stores and services, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Data Lake Storage.

- **REST APIs:** You can use the Web activity to connect to REST APIs, which allows you to perform operations such as reading, writing, and updating data stored in external systems.

- **Custom activities:** You can create custom activities using the Azure Data Factory SDKs, which allows you to connect to external systems that are not natively supported by Azure Synapse Pipelines.

- **Integration Runtime:** Azure Data Factory uses an integration runtime to move data between different environments, the integration runtime can be configured to allow data movement between on-premises and cloud.

- **Logic Apps:** You can use Logic Apps connectors to integrate with external systems and services, such as SharePoint, Dynamics, and Salesforce.

By integrating external components with Azure Synapse Pipelines, data engineers can create data integration workflows that move data between different systems and perform data transformations, regardless of where the data is stored or how it is generated. This enables organizations to make sense of their data by consolidating it and making it available for further analysis and reporting.

## Why Spark Notebooks

**Spark notebooks in Azure Synapse Pipelines** allow you to perform big data analytics and data processing tasks in a collaborative, interactive environment. You can use the notebooks to write and execute code, visualize data, and share results with others. Additionally, Azure Synapse Pipelines provides integration with other Azure services, such as Azure Data Lake Storage and Azure SQL Data Warehouse, making it easy to access and analyze large amounts of data stored in these services. Using Spark notebooks in Azure Synapse Pipelines can also help increase productivity and improve the overall efficiency of data processing tasks.

Spark notebooks in Synapse Analytics offer several advantages, including:

1. **Interactive development**: Spark notebooks allow you to write, test, and debug code in an interactive environment, which can help increase productivity and reduce development time.

2. **Collaboration**: Spark notebooks can be shared and collaborated on by multiple users, making it easy for teams to work together on data processing tasks.

3. **Data visualization**: Spark notebooks allow you to visualize data using popular libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and bokeh, which can help you understand and communicate insights from your data more effectively.

4. **Scalability**: Spark is a distributed computing framework that can handle large amounts of data, allowing you to perform big data analytics and data processing tasks on a cluster of machines.

5. **Integration with Azure Services** : Spark notebooks can easily integrate with other Azure services like Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and Azure Machine Learning, which makes it easy to access and analyze large amounts of data stored in these services.

6. **Flexibility**: Spark notebooks can be used for a variety of data processing tasks, including data wrangling, data exploration, machine learning, and more, making it a versatile tool for data scientists and engineers.

7. **Ease of Use**: Spark notebooks in Synapse Analytics do not require a dedicated Spark cluster, as they are executed on the Synapse Analytics workspace managed Spark cluster which makes it easy to start using Spark for data processing and analytics tasks, as you donâ€™t need to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

8. **Isolation and Control**: You can run your Spark notebooks on dedicated or auto-pause Spark pools, which are isolated Spark clusters that you can configure, scale and pay for separately. This allows you to have more control over the resources and performance, and use the Spark pools for more demanding workloads.
