While the use of Spark Notebooks isn't the only external component available to you as a data engineer, it is potentially one of the more valuable ones in your arsenal in order to collaborate and develop best-of-breed solutions with your colleagues on other teams. It also allows the reuse of other external components which can save time and simplify complex transformations.

At the end of this module, you should:

- understand the external components to analytics pipelines.
- be able to explain the Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline process(es).
- understand the major components which make up Azure Synapse Analytics Pipelines which are directly relatable to Azure Data Factory.
