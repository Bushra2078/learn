A coded UI makes it difficult to manage layout and behavior. This approach often includes layout and behavioral logic, and results in a tight-coupling between the two. A change in the UI design can cause a knock-on effect to the rest of the codebase. Maintaining a codebase where there's no clean separation of UI and behavior can be difficult.

.NET MAUI enables you to define a UI using XAML. This separation allows you to focus on behavior logic in your C# code files. The UI designers can now focus on the UI while programmers can focus on code.

.NET MAUI XAML enables you to customize the UI for each platform using the `OnPlatform` mark-up extension. This approach lets you design apps that can make use of OS-specific UI features but still looks good on all platforms.

In this module, you saw how to use XAML to its best effect for designing the UI for a cross-platform app. Specifically, you learned:

- The benefits of using XAML over defining the UI for a .NET MAUI app in C#
- How to create pages and controls, and set their properties using XAML
- How to handle UI events and wire them up in XAML
- How to create and use XAML mark-up extensions
- How to set platform-specific values in XAML mark-up
