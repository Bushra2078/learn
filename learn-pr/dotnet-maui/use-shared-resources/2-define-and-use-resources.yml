  questions:
  - content: "What happens when the value a `StaticResource` refers to changes after it's been assigned to a variable?"

    - content: "An exception will be thrown."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. An exception will be thrown if you try to access a key that isn't found."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. It's called a `StaticResource` because it only is evaluated once."
