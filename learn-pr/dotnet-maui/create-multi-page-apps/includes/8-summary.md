Part of planning your app's architecture is deciding how the user will move between pages. In this module, you'll learn how to use tabbed pages to implement an app that presents data on multiple pages. You should now understand when this navigation pattern is appropriate, how to implement it, and how you can customize the behavior of tabbed pages. You also learned how to combine tabbed pages with navigation pages that use the navigation stack. Specifically, you learned how to:

- Implement tab navigation with the `TabbedPage` layout
- Configure platform-specific settings for tabs
- Use navigation pages within tabbed pages
