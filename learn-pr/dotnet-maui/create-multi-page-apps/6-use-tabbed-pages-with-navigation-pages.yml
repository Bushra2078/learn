quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When is tab navigation a good choice for an app?"
    choices:
    - content: "You have only a few pages in your app and the pages all have equal importance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Tabs make it fast for the user to switch between the pages. This navigation style works well with pages of equal importance, because it's likely that the user will need to switch pages frequently."
    - content: "The app's pages tend to be traversed from general to more specific."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tabs aren't well-suited to traversing a hierarchy of pages, because they don't remember the user's navigation sequence."
    - content: "The app's pages require extensive scrolling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The use of tab navigation is unrelated to the scrolling requirements of the pages it presents."
  - content: "Suppose you're a developer using `TabbedPage` for a tabbed UI. How do you present the new page when the user selects a tab?"
    choices:
    - content: "First, you call a method to dismiss the old page. Second, you call a different method to present the new page."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`TabbedPage` doesn't provide any methods to manage the visibility of the pages it hosts."
    - content: "Call a method to present the appropriate page to the user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`TabbedPage` doesn't provide any methods to manage the visibility of the pages it hosts."
    - content: "There's nothing for you to do. `TabbedPage` presents the appropriate page automatically."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "`TabbedPage` handles the page-switching for you. There's no code for you to write."
