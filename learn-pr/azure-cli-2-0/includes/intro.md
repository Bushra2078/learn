Azure CLI 2.0 is the new command-line experience for managing Azure resources. You can use it in your browser with Azure Cloud Shell, or you can install it on macOS, Linux, or Windows, and run it from the command line.

Azure CLI 2.0 is optimized for managing and administering Azure resources from the command line, and for building automation scripts that work against Azure Resource Manager.
