AI uses data at every step of the journey. So what is data? Data is everything you could record on paper. For example:

* *__Continuous__* variables (things which can be measured as numbers) like times, sizes, weights, temperatures, colors.
* *__Categories__* a bit like a header on a list, categories might be things like fixed / broken, acceptable / unacceptable, or country of birth.

There are two key kinds of data we will use again and again:

1. __Features__ are aspects of an event/object/person that we are interested in. These can be continuous or categorical. For example, a person’s features might include their height (continuous) and favourite sport (categorical).
2. __Labels__ are categories we put events/objects/people into. For example, we might label a cake “good” or “bad”; label a person a “republican”, “independent”, or “democrat”, or label a particular image as “containing fish” or “not containing fish”.
  
Next up we'll do a quick programming exercise. This exercise will quickly walk you through how to set up and use Azure Notebooks. It's nice and easy, so don't worry.

## Summary

Here we introduced:
* __Continuous variables__ - measurable data points, such as weight and temperature
* __Categories__ - such as fixed / broken, acceptable / unacceptable
* __Features__ - data points for an example (event/object/person) such as hair color or height. Features can be continuous variables or categories.
* __Labels__ - categories we assign to data points.
