Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study of how to make computers perform tasks that humans consider difficult through the creation of intelligent agents. The study of AI began in the 1950s, and it has improved dramatically over time with better statistical methods and greater computing power. 

AI is now used for all sorts of things, such as intelligent opponents in video games, accurate medical diagnosis, speech commands on mobile phones, and keeping email inboxes clear of spam. People who use AI often want it to perform repetitive tasks that take a lot of time for a person to do, or to solve problems, which seem almost impossible to solve with a calculator. For example, AI can be used to:

* intelligently guess the products that someone may want to buy.
* count cells in a microscope picture.
* find the optimum number of taxis that a city needs.
* read the license plates of cars in a video.
* predict the quantity of ingredients a restaurant needs to order to minimize waste, but not run out of stock.

Although this sounds difficult, there are free tools available online which makes it easy to get started.

### What is machine learning

![Venn diagram showing Artificial Intelligence encompassing all of machine learning, and machine learning encompassing all of deep learning. Artificial Intelligence - Techniques which allow computers to mimic human intelligence, including use of logic, decision trees, and machine learning (including deep learning). Machine Learning - A subset of artificial intelligence where statistical methods are used to help a system improve at tasks with training and experience. This category includes deep learning. Deep learning - A subset of machine learning where a system can train itself to perform tasks, including language and image analysis, by using multi-layered neural networks.](../media/1-1-a.png)

__Machine learning__ is a subset of AI. When normal computer software needs to be improved, people edit it. Machine learning, on the other hand, is software that rewrites itself to get better at a specific task. For example, some online stores use machine learning to review your previous spending habits to give you personalized recommendations. There are lots of kinds of machine learning, including neural networks and deep learning.

### What are neural networks and deep learning

Lines then appear from left to right - linking the top circle of the input layer to the top circle of the hidden layer, then the top circle of the input layer to the second circle of the hidden layer, and so on until all the circle in the input layer have a line connecting them to all circles in the middle, "hidden", layer. This then repeats for linking the "hidden" layer to the two circles on the "output" layer. So in the end all circles are connected to every circle to in the layers to the left and right of them.](../media/1-1-b.gif)

Stick around and see! These are fairly advanced AI methods that weâ€™ll cover later in the course. In short, __neural networks__ are a type of machine learning algorithm, modeled on how we thought the human brain worked. __Deep learning__ is a particular way of organizing a neural network, which can solve very difficult problems, like identifying faces from photos or videos.

## Summary

Welcome to the course! Here we covered:

* __AI__ - the study of how to make computers perform tasks that humans consider difficult.
* __Machine learning__ - a subset of AI, software that rewrites *itself* to get better at a specific task.
* __Deep learning__ - a certain way of organizing a neural network which can solve very difficult problems.

Next we will look at some fundamentals of AI and do an introduction to programming machine learning in your browser, using Azure Notebooks.
