  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are:"
    choices:
    - content: "Completely separate fields of study."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning is a subset of AI."
    - content: "AI is computers performing tasks that humans consider difficult through the creation of intelligent agents, and machine learning is type of AI that rewrites itself to get better at a specific task."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AI is a broad field, and machine learning is a subset of AI."
    - content: "Related fields of study written in Python."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning is a subset of AI, and both can be written in many different programming languages."
    - content: "Different words for the same thing - predictive models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While AI and machine learning both include predictive models, they involve many other aspects."
  - content: "Deep learning involves:"
    choices:
    - content: "Neural networks, organized in a particular way so they can solve very complex problems."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Deep learning involves various types of neural networks which can solve very difficult problems, like identifying faces from photos or videos."
    - content: "A type of machine learning algorithm that predicts categories."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While deep learning is a type of machine learning algorithm, deep learning can predict more than just categories."
    - content: "A specific type of cost, used to lower error in models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While deep learning involves cost and models, but deep learning is a specific type of machine learning."
    - content: "A new type of machine learning algorithm that is not ready for production environments as the error is too high."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While deep learning is a machine learning algorithm, in many cases it outperforms other solutions and is ready for production environments."
  - content: "Continuous variables and categories are:"
    choices:
    - content: "Continuous variables are a class of something (approved / unapproved, fixed / broken), while categories are things that can be measured in numbers (height, weight etc)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Continuous variables are not a class, and categories are not measured in numbers."
    - content: "Continuous variables are things that can be measured in numbers (height, weight etc), while categories are a specific set of numbers to represent something."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While continuous variables are measurable data points, categories are not a class not a specific set of numbers."
    - content: "Continuous variables are things that can be measured in numbers (height, weight etc), while categories are a class of something (approved / unapproved, fixed / broken)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Continuous variables are measurable data points, and categories are a distinct class of something."
    - content: "Continuous variables whole numbers that represent data points, while categories are a class of something (approved / unapproved, fixed / broken)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Continuous variables do not need to be whole numbers."
  - content: "How does error differ from cost?"
    choices:
    - content: "Error is a measure of how accurate a model is, whereas cost is a penalty calculated from the error."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Error is a measure of how accurate the model is overall, whereas cost is an metric calculated from the error using a cost function."
    - content: "Error is calculated from the cost, using a cost function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cost is calculated from the error."
    - content: "The are not different."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cost is a metric we use in training a model, which is calculated from the error."
    - content: "Cost is measure of how accurate a model is, whereas error is a the overall penalty calculated from the cost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cost is the overall penalty calculated from the error."
