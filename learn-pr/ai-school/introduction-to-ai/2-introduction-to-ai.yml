  questions:
  - content: "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are:"
    choices:
    - content: "Separate fields of study."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning is a subset of AI."
    - content: "AI is computers performing tasks that humans consider difficult through the creation of intelligent agents, and machine learning is type of AI that rewrites itself to get better at a specific task."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AI is a broad field, and machine learning is a subset of AI."
    - content: "Related fields of study written in Python."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning is a subset of AI, and both can be written in many different programming languages."
    - content: "Different words for the same thing - predictive models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While AI and machine learning both include predictive models, they involve many other aspects."
  - content: "Deep learning involves:"
    choices:
    - content: "Neural networks, organized in particular ways so they can solve very complex problems."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Deep learning involves various types of neural networks, which can solve very difficult problems, like identifying faces from photos or videos."
    - content: "A type of machine learning algorithm that predicts categories."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While deep learning is a type of machine learning algorithm, deep learning can predict more than just categories."
    - content: "A specific type of cost, used to lower error in models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While deep learning involves cost and models, but deep learning is a specific type of machine learning."
    - content: "A new type of machine learning algorithm that is not ready for production environments as the error is too high."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While deep learning is a machine learning algorithm, in many cases it outperforms other solutions and is ready for production environments."
