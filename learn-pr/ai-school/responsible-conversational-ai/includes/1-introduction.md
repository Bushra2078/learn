*When famed sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov developed his Four Laws of Robotics, AI was still fiction. Now AI is a daily reality, and new rules are needed to make sure that it — and its creators — behave responsibly.*

AI is rapidly becoming normalized. In fact, it’s more correct to say that AI is already normalized, and has been for some time. Even the least tech-savvy consumers make use of AI daily, often hourly, and usually without realizing. AI-augmented image searches are commonplace; your friends are tagged in your photos thanks to machine learning; and even your Netflix recommendations are curated by AI-powered analytics with access to vast troves of viewer data. 

But this kind of AI tends to be invisible to the user. Conversational AI is different. With conversational AI, users know that they are interacting with an artificial intelligence. These services are now commonplace. Cortana, Siri, and Google Assistant live in your smartphones, and Amazon Echo sits on the kitchen bench. As well as smartphones, PCs, and other specialist devices, conversational AI is now enabled in cars, TVs and on the world wide web, often through consumer devices. If you’ve used a chat window to speak to a customer service representative online, chances are you’ve spoken to an AI before being put through to a human being — assuming the AI didn’t solve the problem for you without ever requiring human assistance. Rapid and continual advances in conversational AI mean that AI is increasingly able to solve problems on its own, and the line between human and AI help is fast blurring into a grey area. 

Although AI is still very far from being able to “think” as humans do, its ubiquity and the rapidly increasing capability of conversational AI creates special ethical challenges. We are only just starting to realize the capabilities of conversational AI bots, and for this technology to reach its full potential to help society, conversational AI must be developed in a way that earns and deserves society’s full trust.

Microsoft has created special guidelines for the development of responsible conversational AI. It’s important to remember that, while AI bots may appear to be intelligent, the real intelligence comes from the developers who put these smart programs together — and so the responsibility to create ethically rests with them. It’s perhaps best summed up by the mantra made famous by Spider-Man: with great power, comes great responsibility.
