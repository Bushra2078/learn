Next weâ€™re going to do another programming exercise - we'll make a basic neural network using Keras.

The exercises for this module use Azure Notebooks. It is a free-to-use resource.

If the links below don't work, you will need to set up your free Azure Notebooks account and clone the project for this module. See the [Python GitHub repository](MicrosoftDocs/ms-learn-ml-crash-course-python) or the [R GitHub repository](MicrosoftDocs/ms-learn-ml-crash-course-R) for instructions to get started.
