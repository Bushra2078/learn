Next weâ€™re going to do another programming exercise - we'll make a basic neural network using Keras.

The exercises for this module use Azure Notebooks. It is a free-to-use resource.

If the links below don't work, you will need to set up your free Azure Notebooks account and clone the project for this module. See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-intro-to-ai-concepts) for instructions to get started.
