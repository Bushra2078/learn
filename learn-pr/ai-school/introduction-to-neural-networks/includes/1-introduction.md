Now we’ve covered the fundamentals and core algorithms of machine learning, we’ll look at one of the hottest topics in computer systems - neural networks. We’ll work through the core principles behind neural networks, how to make them easily with TensorFlow, and how to implement them effectively.

In this module, we’ll work through the fundamentals of neural networks and train two simple neural networks models in Azure Notebooks.

**In this module, you will learn to:**

* Describe neural network structures, layers, edges, and weights.
* Implement different activation functions and network structures.
* Practically apply different types of gradient descent.

We’ll introduce you to the key concepts of neural networks and get you building your first neural networks in Azure Notebooks.

Let’s explore the fundamentals of neural networks.
