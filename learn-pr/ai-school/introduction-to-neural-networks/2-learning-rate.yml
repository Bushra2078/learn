  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Before training, weights are usually:"
    choices:
    - content: "All very high (positive) numbers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the weights are all very high, the neural network is likely to have very poor performance."
    - content: "Random numbers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. We randomize the weights so the cost doesn't get stuck in a local minima."
    - content: "All zeros."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the weights are all zeros, no data will flow through the neural network."
    - content: "All very low (negative) numbers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While weights can be negative, they don't all start out negative."
