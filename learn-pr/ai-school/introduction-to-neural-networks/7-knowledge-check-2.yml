  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "Activation functions change whether data flows from one node to another."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "It is obvious which activation function to use, before starting training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "There are only two activation functions available: ReLu and tanh."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Sigmoid is always the first activation function you should try."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no rule that you have to try a specific activation function first."
  - content: "Back Propagation:"
    choices:
    - content: "Helps to undo design errors when setting up a neural network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Is one method by which neural networks learn."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the error is large, this means that the predicted values do not match the data well."
    - content: "Is used to determine how accurate a neural network is."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Negative error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a:"
    choices:
    - content: "Variation of gradient descent particularly suited for training large neural networks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SGD uses a single example per iteration, which helps train large neural networks efficiently."
    - content: "Type of node."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SGD is a method we use."
    - content: "Variation of labels for neural networks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We use the same labels for neural networks as we do other machine learning algorithms."
    - content: "An activation function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SGD is a method we use to optimize machine learning models."
