  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Edges:"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect nodes to one another"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Edges connect nodes from layer to layer."
    - content: "Are nodes that are at the edge of layers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Edges are not a type of node, edges connect nodes."
    - content: "Are layers that are at the front or end of the neural network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Edges connect nodes (and thus layers) together, but edges are not layers themselves."
    - content: "Hide layers from the programmer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Edges can't hide layers, they connect nodes (and thus layers) together."
  - content: "Before training, weights are usually:"
    choices:
    - content: "All very high (positive) numbers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the weights are all very high the neural network is likely to have very poor performance."
    - content: "Random numbers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. We randomize the weights so the cost does not get stuck in a local minima."
    - content: "All zeros."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the weights are all zeros no data will flow through the neural network."
    - content: "All very low (negative) numbers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While weights can be negative, they do not all start out negative."
