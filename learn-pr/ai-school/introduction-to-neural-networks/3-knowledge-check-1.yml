  questions:
  - content: "Artificial Neural Networks can perform:"
    choices:
    - content: "Categorization."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Both Categorization and Regression."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Regression."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Abstract thought."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "Which is correct? Artificial neural networks:"
    choices:
    - content: "Have two or more layers, each of which contains many nodes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Have two or more nodes, each of which contains many layers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Can hide layers from the programmer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although middle layers are named  as 'hidden' they are visible to the programmer."
    - content: "Only have two edges."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Neural networks can have many edges."
  - content: "Edges:"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect nodes to one another"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Are nodes that are at the edge of layers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Are layers that are at the front or end of the neural network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Hide layers from the programmer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "Before training, weights are usually:"
    choices:
    - content: "All very high (positive) numbers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Random numbers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "All zeros."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
