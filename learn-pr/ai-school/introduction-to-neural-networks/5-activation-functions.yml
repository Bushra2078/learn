  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "Activation functions determine if data flows from one node to another."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Activation functions can turn a node 'off', meaning that no data flows from that node to others."
    - content: "It is obvious which activation function to use, before starting training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You must experiment with different activation functions to optimize your neural network models."
    - content: "There are only two activation functions available: ReLu and tanh."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While ReLu and tanh are two of the most popular activation functions, there are many different activation functions."
    - content: "Sigmoid is always the first activation function you should try."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no rule that you have to try a specific activation function first."
    - content: "Back Propagation:"
    choices:
    - content: "Helps to undo design errors when setting up a neural network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Back propagation helps neural networks optimize their predictions, but don't undo design errors."
    - content: "Is a method by which neural networks learn."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Back propagation helps neural networks optimize their weights effectively, increasing accuracy."
    - content: "Is used to determine how accurate a neural network is."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Back propagation helps improve accuracy for the neural network, but it does not determine how accurate the neural network is."
    - content: "is negative error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Back propagation helps decrease the error, but it's not negative error itself."
  - content: "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a:"
    choices:
    - content: "Variation of gradient descent particularly suited for training large neural networks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SGD uses a single example per iteration, which helps train large neural networks efficiently."
    - content: "Type of node."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SGD is a method we use for neural networks, not a structural part of the neural network itself."
    - content: "Variation of labels for neural networks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We use the same labels for neural networks as we do other machine learning algorithms."
    - content: "An activation function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SGD is a method we use to optimize machine learning models."
