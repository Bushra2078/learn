  questions:
  - content: "Gradient descent tries to find parameters to get a cost to be:"
    choices:
    - content: "As high as possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Gradient descent optimizes but finding a minima for the cost."
    - content: "As low as possible."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Gradient descent finds parameters to give a minimum cost value."
    - content: "Even."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Gradient descent tried to minimize cost."
    - content: "Negative."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Gradient descent does not make cost negative."
