  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is a classification problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Predicting whether a person will buy a product or not."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Predicting whether someone is going to be 'a customer' or 'not a customer' is a classification problem."
    - content: "Predicting the amount of wheat that a field will grow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The amount of wheat that a field will grow is a number, not a category."
    - content: "Predicting how long a freezer will take to freeze a cup of water."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The time taken would be a number, not a category."
    - content: "Predicting the cost of gas for a car trip."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The cost of gas would be a number."
  - content: "To train, supervised categorization algorithms need:"
    choices:
    - content: "Examples of data that have labels, such a pictures of dogs with the type of dogs for each picture."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the error is small, this means that the predicted values are close to the data points."
    - content: "Human supervision to prevent the algorithms crashing or reporting errors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "A variety of labels presented as input, instead of data, such as lots of names of car without seeing the pictures of the car themselves."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Large numbers of cat and dog images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Supervised categorization algorithms do more than predict cat and dog images."
  - content: "Simple logistic regression can choose between how many categories?"
    choices:
    - content: "2 categories"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It is a binary classification algorithm."
    - content: "3 categories"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Simple logistic regression a binary classification algorithm - it does not predict several categories."
    - content: "As many as the data provides"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Simple logistic regression cannot predict several categories even if the data set provides them."
    - content: "0"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Simple logistic regression has to predict categories."
  - content: "Logistic regression is based on a line that is what shape?"
    choices:
    - content: "Straight."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. "
    - content: "Bell shaped."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. "
    - content: "S-Shaped."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. "
    - content: "Pointy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The line is not pointy."
