## Logistic regression

Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm. Don’t be fooled by the ‘regression’ in the name, this simply means that it predicts the probability of a category.

In the plot below we compare customer satisfaction with different cocoa percentages using logistic regression.

Logistic regression can plot a curve that can help us predict the likelihood that a customer is satisfied based on the cocoa percentage of the chocolate bar.

Logistic regression is a nice, easy introduction to classification algorithms. Similar to the variations of linear regression we have covered, variations of logistic regression can model some quite complicated data and even predict multiple categories.
