Congratulations! You've completed the first module of the course. Take a moment to read this recap of what we covered:

* __Models__ - in AI, models are software that gives a prediction (or estimation) to an example, using data provided to it. For example, an AI model could predict how fast a car will go based on the type of car and how much the accelerator pedal is pushed.
* __Error__ - how accurate a model is at predicting something.
* __Cost__ - the error metric models learn from and try to decrease, calculated from the error.
* __Cost functions__ - a mathematical formula run by software to determine for us the cost of a model. Different models have different cost functions and they are built into the model for us already.

In this module, you were introduced to AI, machine learning, and deep learning. You covered the fundamental concepts of AI, and set up your programming environment in Azure Notebooks.

Congratulations! You've completed the introduction to classification module. Take a moment to read this recap of what we covered:

* __Classification__ - assigning labels to new data. For example, predicting whether a future soccer match will be a “win” or “loss”.
* __Logistic regression__ - a common classification algorithm that produces a line of best fit to data from previous events.
  * Can be used to give us the probability that something is true, or an event will happen.  
* __AI often learns iteratively__ - starting with a bad approximation and changing variables (like line-slope) until a model becomes accurate.
  * The real world is very variable, and so __we cannot expect our models to become 100% accurate__.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Define what classfication is.
* Build a logisitic regression model.
* Describe what training, irreducible error, and Bayes error are.

Up next is advanced classification models. We’ll walk you through using one of the most powerful and elegant AI models, support vector machines. Let's go!
