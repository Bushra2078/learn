Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm. Don’t be fooled by the ‘regression’ in the name, this simply means that it predicts the probability of a category.

In the plot below we compare customer satisfaction with different cocoa percentages using logistic regression.

![Scatter plot showing a logistic regression with only one feature. The Y-axis represents satisfaction likelihood and the X-axis represent coca percent. The blue data points on the bottom of the Y-axis, with low levels of cocoa percent. The green data points are at the top of the Y-axis with high levels of cocoa percent. There is a non-linear black line that divides the two categories.](../media/3.1_LogisticRegression-02.png)

Logistic regression can plot a curve that can help us predict the likelihood that a customer is satisfied based on the cocoa percentage of the chocolate bar.

Logistic regression is a nice, easy introduction to classification algorithms. Similar to the variations of linear regression we have covered, variations of logistic regression can model some quite complicated data and even predict multiple categories.

Next up we have a programming exercise to do - we'll use logistic regression to predict which team will win a football (soccer) match.
