In this module, you were introduced to regression and modeling datasets using regression models. You covered the fundamental concepts of regression, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Articulate the fundamentals of regression.
* Apply simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression predictive models.
* Model non-linear data sets.

Congratulations, that's the end of the module! In the next module, we have an introduction to classification.
