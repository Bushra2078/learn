In this module, you were introduced to regression and modeling datasets using regression models. You covered the fundamental concepts of regression, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Define regression.
* Make predictive models with variations of linear regression.
* Make predictions on non-linear data with regression.

Congratulations, that's the end of the module! In the next module, we have an introduction to classification.
