Now you’ve had an overview of the fundamentals of AI, we’ll go over more commonly-used models, as well as introducing some best practices that will help you get good results from your AI models.

In this module, we’ll work through using a linear and polynomial regression algorithms.

**In this module, you will learn to:**

* Learn the fundamentals of regression.
* Learn how to make simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression predictive models.
* Learn about non-linear data sets.

We’ll introduce you to the key concepts of regression and get you building your first predictive models in Azure Notebooks.

Let’s explore the fundamentals of regression.
