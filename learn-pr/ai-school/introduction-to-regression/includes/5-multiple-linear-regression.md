Linear regression using multiple features is called __multiple linear regression__. Multiple linear regression is similar to simple linear regression, but rather than just using one feature to predict another, it uses multiple features to predict one other.

Below is a plot where we use two features, weight and horsepower, to predict fuel efficiency. As you can see, rather than just a line (which is one-dimensional) it fits a flat surface (which is two dimensional). It's common to use many more features than two, but these analyzes become difficult or impossible to visualize as a graph.

![Three-dimensional plot showing multiple linear regression. The Y-axis represents CO2 emissions (grams per kilometer), the X-axis represents car weight (tonne), and the Z-axis represents horsepower. A flat square begins at the bottom the Y-axis. The square then rises and adjusts its coordinates to cover the data points in the middle of the three-dimension plot as best it can.](../media/2-3-a.gif)

## Summary

That's it! Here we covered:

* __Multiple linear regression__ - linear regression that uses more than one feature.

Next up we will build a multiple linear regression model and visualize it.
