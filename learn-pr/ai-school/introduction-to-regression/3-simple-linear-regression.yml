  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What kind of line does linear regression fit?"
    choices:
    - content: "Straight or curved, whichever best fits the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Linear regression finds the best straight line that fits the data. It does not check if a curved line is a better fit."
    - content: "Straight."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Linear regression tries to find the optimal angle and position for a straight line."
    - content: "Curved."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Linear regression finds the best linear line that fits the data."
    - content: "Jagged."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Linear regression finds a regular line that fits the data."
  - content: "A line that fits well will have a:"
    choices:
    - content: "Small error."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the error is small, this means that the predicted values are close to the data points."
    - content: "Large error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the error is large, this means that the predicted values do not match the data well."
    - content: "Unknown error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The error must be known to know how well the line fits the data."
    - content: "Negative error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The error can not be negative."
  - content: "For linear regression: At x=10, we have a data point at y=4. At x=10, our line gives a predicted value of y= 7. What is the error (squared difference) at this data point?"
    choices:
    - content: "0"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Error comes from the y component, not the x."
    - content: "3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Remember to square the difference."
    - content: "9"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. y=4 for the data point, but y=7 for the predicted value. 7 â€“ 4 = 3. We then square the value: 3 ^ 2 = 9."
    - content: "-9"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. As the error is the squared difference, the error cannot be negative."
