In this module, you learned about what an LLM is and how they’re more “general purpose” than traditional AI models. This makes LLMs great to use for various tasks.

You also learned core concepts like prompts, tokens and completions.

Finally, you were introduced to different models like gpt-35-turbo, which is helpful for many tasks, embedding models for search clustering and DALL-E for generating images.
