In this module, you learned about what an LLM is and how they’re more “general purpose” than traditional AI models. This makes LLMs great to use for a variety of tasks.

You also learned core concepts like prompts, tokens and completions.

Finally, you were introduced to different models like gpt-35-turbo, which is good for a variety of tasks, embedding models for search clustering and DALL-E for generating images.
