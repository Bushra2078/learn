There are many considerations when choosing a model, including cost, availability, performance, and capability. 

Generally, we recommend the following guides:

- **gpt-35-turbo**: This model is economical, has good performance, and despite the ChatGPT name can be used for a wide range of tasks beyond chat and conversation.

- **gpt-35-turbo-16k**, **gpt-4** or **gpt-4-32k**: If you need to generate more than 4,096 tokens or need to support larger prompts. These models are more expensive, can be slower, and have limited availability, but they're the most powerful models available today.

- **Embeddings models**: If you have tasks like search, clustering, recommendations and anomaly detection you can use the embedding models. Computers can easily utilize a vector of numbers that forms the embedding. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. The distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity.

For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar.

- **DALL-E**: If you need a model that generates images from text prompts. This model differs from other language models as its output is image not text.

- **Whisper**: If you need speech to text capabilities like transcribing audio files. This model is trained on a large dataset of English audio and text. It's optimized for transcribing audio files that contain speech in English. It can also be used to transcribe audio files that contain speech in other languages. The output of the model is English text. It's best used for quickly transcribing audio files one at a time, translating audio from other languages into English or providing a prompt to the model to guide the output.
