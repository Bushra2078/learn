Overall, we recommend using large language models when you need to generate text, images or even code.

There are three different categories of generative AI models:

- **Natural language models**: It can take in natural language and generate responses.
- **Generative** **pretrained** **transformers or GPT models**: It can take natural language or code snippets and translate them into code.
- **Image generation models**: It can take prompts, a base image, or both and create a new image.

## Text processing

Large language models can do multiple natural language tasks, some of which include:

| **Task** | **Prompt** |
|---|---|
| **Summarizing text** | "Summarize this text into a short blurb" |
| **Classifying text** | "What genre of book is this?" |
| **Generating names or phrases** | "Write a tagline for my flower company" |
| **Translation** | "Translate 'How are you' to French" |
| **Answering questions** | "What does Azure OpenAI do?" |
| **Suggesting content** | "Give me the five best weddings songs" |

## Work with code

Large language models are proficient in over a dozen programming languages, such as C#, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and is most capable in Python. With this feature, you can solve for the following challenges:

- **Build applications**: You can use it to generate code like a Web API based on text sentence.
- **Maintain applications**: Many times, you work on an existing codebase. A large language model can help here as well by modifying the existing code.
- **Improve applications**: A third aspect of code is to improve it for a specific metric, like increasing security or logging.

For example, given the input "Write a for loop counting from 1 to 10 in Python," the following answer is provided:

```python

for i in range(1,11):

    print(i)

```

## Image processing

Large language models can create both realistic and artistic images, change the layout or style of an image, and create variations on a provided image.

There are three different capabilities available:

- **Image generation**: It can generate original images using input text of what you would like the image to be. The more detailed you are, the more likely the model will provide the desired image.
- **Editing an image**: It can edit an image using input text of what you would like it to be. You can change the style of an image, add or remove items, or generate new content to add.
- **Image variations**: it can generate variations of an image using an image and specifying how many variations of the image you would like. The image will stay the same, but the color may change, background scene, and where the objects are located.
