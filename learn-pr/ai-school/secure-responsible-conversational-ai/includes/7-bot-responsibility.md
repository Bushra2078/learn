Modern bots are incredibly useful, and they are only becoming more so. However, at this point in time, they are still a long way from fully autonomous. AI experts disagree on when full AI autonomy will appear — if it ever does. Even the most optimistic estimates predict true autonomy / machine sentience will not arrive for another 50 years. Until, and if, that ever occurs, human designers will always bear the ultimate moral and ethical burden of what they create.

## Build human supervision feedback loops into they system by design

Your bot shouldn’t be able to run away with you. Building human feedback loops into your autonomous system prevents the law of unintended consequences from getting away from you. It’s a simple lesson, but it’s still true: one of the most important functions of any machine is a working “off” switch.

## Determine roles within your organization that clearly define who is responsible for what

Every organization, even organizations of one, have someone to whom ultimate responsibility for your bot can be assigned. Before your bot is deployed, your organization needs to decide who that is for you. If you are developing a bot that your organization will deploy, you should recognize that you are fully responsible for its operation and how it affects people. If you are designing a bot to be deployed by a third party, come to a shared understanding with them of who is ultimately responsible for the bot and document that understanding.

## Monitoring and automated controls

__Ensure you tie monitoring into an automated alert system__, and dedicate resources and time to monitoring and assessing your bots performance.

Truly autonomous AI may still be hypothetical, but until (or if) it does arise, one thing remains true: The developers of bots have responsibility, and are accountable, for their operations. As bots become more and more powerful, this will only become more true.
