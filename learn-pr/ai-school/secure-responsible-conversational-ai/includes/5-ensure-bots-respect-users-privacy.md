Privacy considerations are important with any software application, but this is extremely so with bots. Bots are a unique interface that can learn a great deal of particularly personal information from users. Due in large part to the trust that bot creators should always be trying hard to create, users may share more information with bots than they would with other services. The legislative world is well aware of this, and legal frameworks are keeping pace with bot development and are demanding user privacy be respected. We have included a subsection on the European Union’s landmark privacy legislation, GDPR, below.

As a matter of ethical and sound legal principle, you should be careful with any information that your bot collects from users.

## Your bot should only collect information from users that it needs to perform its job

It’s also important to design user privacy controls into the bot. Users should be able to find out, easily and without having to jump through hoops, all the information that the bot knows about them, so design this right into the bot. You should also obtain and privacy reviews before going too far into development to ensure your bot is compliant with relevant laws in your own jurisdiction, as well as any locale that users will be operating in.

## Implementation

Inform users up-front about what data is being collected, and what it’s being used for. Always give your users the option of which external services to share your data with and an option to opt out where possible. And don’t make a bot that’s dependent on sharing data with outside services where you can’t verify data security or user privacy.

As mentioned above in “Design”, you should include in your deployment the opportunity to share with users all the data that the bot has collected on them. This might be best implemented as a “profile page” that includes the ability to manage privacy settings, plus any relevant legal information pertaining to their data.

As well as giving users the option to see what personal data the bot collects, you should also make it possible for the bot to forget about any information that the user has entered erroneously, or simply wants to be forgotten.

## Privacy in the European Union

> The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years.

If the users of your bot are located in the European Union, you will be subject to The EU General Data Protection Regulation known as GDPR. It doesn’t matter where your company based out of, if you have users who live in an EU country then you will need to consider this regulation.

GDPR grants users four main rights that are referred to as Data Subject Rights:

- __Breach Notification__ - Breach notifications must be made within 72 hours of the company becoming aware of the breach.
- __Right to access__ - Users have the right get confirmation of whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose
- __Right to be forgotten__ - Also known as Data Erasure, users have the right to delete any information that is held on them
- __Data portability__ - Users have the right to get access to the data held on them in plain and machine-readable format.

A key tenet is not to store any more information that you need to perform the function of the bot. If you are concerned about whether or not your are compliant, it’s advised to get a GDPR expert involved in your project.

Sometimes, a user’s desire for privacy will conflict with the ability for your bot to provide a service to them. If that happens, that’s OK. It’s better for your bot to be upfront and transparent with privacy and personal information, and offer the user complete (secure) control over what to do with that information. In the long run, this will build trust and help prevent abuse.
