  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Gradient descent tries to find parameters to get a cost to be:"
    choices:
    - content: "As high as possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Gradient descent optimizes but finding a minima for the cost."
    - content: "As low as possible."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Gradient descent finds parameters to give a minimum cost value."
    - content: "Even."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Gradient descent tried to minimize cost."
    - content: "Negative."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Gradient descent does not make cost negative."
  - content: "An SVM uses a hyperplane to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Separate data points into categories."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Hyperplanes determine the category prediction for an example."
    - content: "Evenly distribute data of different classes across the feature space."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hyperplanes are used to best fit examples into categories."
    - content: "Shuttle data efficiently through memory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hyperplanes are used to categorize examples."
    - content: "Predict another dimension."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hyperplanes don't predict dimensions."
  - content: "Test data is:"
    choices:
    - content: "A copy of the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Test data and training data are different."
    - content: "Entirely unlike the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Test and training datasets should be similar, but not have any identical data points."
    - content: "Important to test that a model has not trained too tightly to the training data set."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Test data is used to measure how accurate the model will be on examples it has not been trained on."
    - content: "Only used in algorithms more advanced than SVMs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Test data is used in simple and advanced algorithms."
  - content: "Overfitting is:"
    choices:
    - content: "When support vectors are too close to a datapoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although support vectors may be close to a datapoint as a consequence of overfitting, this is not a problem, in itself."
    - content: "When a model is trained on a data set that is too large."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Large training data sets tend to help prevent overfitting."
    - content: "When a model is trained so intensely that it becomes less accurate on data it has never seen before."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When a model is too well trained on the training data, it learns its noise rather than only its general trends, making it less accurate on other datasets."
    - content: "When we reach a minimum cost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Minimum cost does not necessarily mean overfitting has occurred."
  - content: "Underfitting is:"
    choices:
    - content: "When a model is trained but has parameters that are too small."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it may do this as a consequence of underfitting, this is not a problem, in itself."
    - content: "When an SVM has been trained too well on the training dataset, and becomes inaccurate on other data sets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Underfitting can occur on any model, not just an SVM."
    - content: "When a model is too simple to represent real patterns in the training and test data sets."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When a model is underfitting the data it is too simple to properly represent patterns in the data sets."
    - content: "When we reach a maximum cost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Underfitting means a model is too simple, but that does not mean we have reached maximum cost."
