  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Gradient Descent tries to find parameters to get a cost to be:"
    choices:
    - content: "As high as possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "As low as possible."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Even."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Negative."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "An SVM uses a hyperplane to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Separate data points into categories."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Evenly distribute data of different classes across the feature space."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Shuttle data efficiently through memory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Predict another dimension."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. "
  - content: "The margins play what role in SVMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define where the support vectors fall"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Modify input data to ensure it is homogeneous."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Ensure that the algorithm only reports two classes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SVMs are able to predict as many classes as desired, assuming sufficient data are available."
    - content: "No role."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SVMs use margins for predictions."
  - content: "Test data is:"
    choices:
    - content: "A copy of the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. "
    - content: "Entirely unlike the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Test and training datasets should be similar, but not have any identical data points."
    - content: "Important to test that a model has not trained too tightly to the training data set."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. "
    - content: "Only used in algorithms more advanced than SVMs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "Overfitting is:"
    choices:
    - content: "When support vectors come too close to a datapoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it may do this as a consequence of overfitting, this is not a problem, per se."
    - content: "When a model is trained on a data set that is too large."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "When an model is trained so intensely that it becomes less accurate on data it has never seen before."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When a model is too well trained on the training data, it learns its noise rather than only its general trends, making it less accurate on other datasets."
    - content: "When we reach minimum cost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "Underfitting is:"
    choices:
    - content: "When a model is trained but has parameters that are too small."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it may do this as a consequence of overfitting, this is not a problem, per se."
    - content: "When a SVM has been trained too well on the training dataset, and becomes inaccurate on other data sets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "When a model is too simple to represent real patterns in the training and test data sets."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. "
    - content: "When we reach maximum cost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
