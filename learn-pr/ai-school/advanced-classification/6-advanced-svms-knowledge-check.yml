    - content: "Higher penalty for datapoints within the margin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "No penalty for datapoints within the margin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Negative penalty for datapoints within the margin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "The Kernel trick allows:"
    choices:
    - content: "Kernels that are not straight lines, flat planes, or similar."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Unrelated operating systems to pass information freely between one another for improved training performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "The soft-margin SVM to be mathematically possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Predicting of only one category."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "Fill in here"
    choices:
    - content: "Hi"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It is a binary classification algorithm."
    - content: "3 categories"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Simple logistic regression a binary classification algorithm - it does not predict several categories."
    - content: "As many as the data provides"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Simple logistic regression cannot predict several categories even if the data set provides them."
    - content: "0"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Simple logistic regression has to predict categories."
