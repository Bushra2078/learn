Now you’ve had an overview of classification, we’ll go over some more advanced content on classification models, as well as introducing some new methods to help you train effective models.

In this module, we’ll work through using support vector machines to predict categories.

**In this module, you will learn to:**

* Learn about cost functions and gradient descent.
* Learn to build a support vector machine model.
* Learn about test sets, overfitting, and underfitting.

Let’s explore the advanced classification.
