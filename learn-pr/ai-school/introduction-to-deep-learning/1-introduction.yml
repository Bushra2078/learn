  questions:
  - content: "Deep learning refers to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Neural networks with at least one hidden layer, sometimes many more."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Deep learning tends to have many hidden layers, causing long training times."
    - content: "Neural networks with many nodes per layer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although deep neural nets often have many nodes per layer, many nodes per layer are not required."
    - content: "All neural networks that are trained for a long time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although they can take a long time to train, 'deep' does not refer to how long it takes to train a network."
    - content: "Random forest."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Random forest is a different type of machine learning model."
