Let's try out making a simple CNN in Azure Notebooks. Weâ€™re going to use a CNN to recognize handwritten digits.

The exercises for this module use Azure Notebooks. It is a free-to-use resource.

If the links below don't work, you will need to set up your free Azure Notebooks account and clone the project for this module.
