Deep learning has made significant progress in recent years, becoming the new state-of-the-art area in AI. Deep learning takes what we did with neural networks and makes it bigger and better.

In this module, we’ll go through a high-level overview of what exists in deep learning and what types of problems you might apply different types of deep learning models to.

**In this module, you will learn to:**

* Articulate common applications for deep learning.
* Apply convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.
* Describe the functions of popular deep learning tools.

Let’s explore deep learning.
