Let’s recap on what we’ve learned in this module.

* __Deep learning__ simply means using neural networks with many layers
  * By having many layers, these networks have more room to learn abstract information, like what a nose or dog looks like.
  * Deep learning algorithms can have very long training times.
  * There are different ways these can be organized.
* __Convolutional neural networks__ are often used for image processing.
* __Recurrent neural networks__ are often used for data in a sequence, such as music, text, and time series data.
  * RNNs have a special kind of memory for data points seen recently.
  * There are different variants of RNNs, each with different advantages.
* To build a deep network one needs to pick tools to do so. There are many tools available, including TensorFlow and Keras.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Apply convolutional neural networks to image data.
* Make text predictions using recurrent neural networks.

Deep learning is an immensely deep field that is constantly improving. The next module is a short one - unsupervised learning. Let's get to it!
