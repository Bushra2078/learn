  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Keras, TensorFlow, and Pytorch are:"
    choices:
    - content: "Software packages to design and run neural networks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Keras, TensorFlow, and Pytorch are all very popular libraries for neural networks."
    - content: "Kinds of deep neural networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Keras, TensorFlow, and Pytorch all allow neural networks to be built, but are not kinds of neural networks themselves."
    - content: "Common neural network design patterns."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Keras, TensorFlow, and Pytorch each have popular design patterns, they are not design patterns themselves."
    - content: "Types of gradient boosted tree models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Keras, TensorFlow, and Pytorch are all related to neural networks."
