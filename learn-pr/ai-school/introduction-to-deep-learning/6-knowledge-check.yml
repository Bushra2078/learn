  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Deep learning refers to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Neural networks with at least one hidden layer, sometimes many more."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Neural networks with many nodes per layer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although deep neural nets often have many nodes per layer, this is not required."
    - content: "All neural networks that are trained for a very long time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although they can take a very long time to train, 'deep' does not refer to how long it takes to train a network."
    - content: "Random forest."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Random forest is a different type of machine learning model."
  - content: "Deep learning is:"
    choices:
    - content: "Only used for image processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Only used for language processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Likely to be useful for all datasets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deep learning requires a large amount of labelled training data, which is often not possible for a given problem."
    - content: "Used for many different applications."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs):"
    choices:
    - content: "Are mostly used for image and video analysis."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Avoid problems with over fitting seen in more traditional neural networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Require much smaller datasets than other types of machine learning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Train faster than traditional large neural networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The feature extraction performed by CNNs can increase the training time required."
  - content: "Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch are:"
    choices:
    - content: "Software packages to design and run neural networks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. "
    - content: "Kinds of deep neural networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Common neural network design patterns."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Types of gradient boosted tree models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are useful when:"
    choices:
    - content: "Prior information (context) is important for understanding."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. "
    - content: "One wishes to use a neural network without having a training dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Neural networks need to be used on specialised hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "You have very small amounts of data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RNNs do not generally perform well with very small datasets."
