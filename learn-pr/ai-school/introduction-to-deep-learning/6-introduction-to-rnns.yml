  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are useful when:"
    choices:
    - content: "Prior information (context) is important for understanding."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. RNNs provide the ability for models to better use recent historical data for predictions."
    - content: "One wishes to use a neural network without having a training dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RNNs still require a training set."
    - content: "Neural networks need to be used on specialized hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RNNs do not require specialized hardware compared to other machine learning models."
    - content: "You have very small amounts of data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RNNs do not generally perform well with very small datasets."
