    - content: "Only used for image processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are many applications for deep learning, not just image processing."
    - content: "Only used for language processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While deep learning is particularly good at language processing, there are many other applications for deep learning."
    - content: "Likely to be useful for all datasets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deep learning requires a large amount of labeled training data, which is often not possible for a given problem."
    - content: "Used for many different applications."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. There are many different variations of deep learning, allowing it to be applied successfully to many different applications."
