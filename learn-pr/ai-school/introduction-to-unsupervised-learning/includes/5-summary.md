We read that unsupervised learning algorithms can split data into categories without ever having been trained and not having labels to judge its own accuracy from. These methods can be very helpful with large unlabeled datasets or ambiguous problems and a commonly seen in the fields of science and statistics. We learned about K-means clustering, which can be given unlabeled data and identify a number of clusters in that data in a few seconds.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Describe unsupervised learning.
* Articulate practical applications of unsupervised learning.
* Use k-means clustering to predict groupings in data.

Well done! Youâ€™ve complete the module on unsupervised learning.
