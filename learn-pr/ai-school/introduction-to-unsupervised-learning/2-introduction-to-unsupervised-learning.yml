  questions:
  - content: "Unsupervised learning is different from supervised learning in that:"
    choices:
    - content: "Training and test results do not need to be checked."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although sometimes training is not separate to use on a final dataset, parameters and results still need to be 'sanity checked'"
    - content: "Training time is usually much slower than supervised learning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Training time is situationally dependent."
    - content: "It does not require a training phase with labeled datasets."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Unsupervised learning does not require labels."
    - content: "It only involves neural networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are many different methods for unsupervised learning."
