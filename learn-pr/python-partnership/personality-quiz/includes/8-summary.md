With your **quiz.py** file, you can now truly know who your friends and family are. Well, kind of. :)

Special thanks to [Audrey St. John from Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/people/audrey-stjohn?azure-portal=true), which inspired this lesson from the "active learning module" developed by Emily Craig and Sarah Robinson for the [MaGE](https://sites.google.com/a/mtholyoke.edu/mage/?azure-portal=true) inclusive peer mentoring program at Mount Holyoke College.

## Additional challenges for your quiz code

As an added challenge, you can start exploring how you might:

- Reduce the number of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in your code.
- Allow users to select a new choice if they didn't enter **A** or **B**.
