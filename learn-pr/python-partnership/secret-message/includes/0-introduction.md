As a novice sleuth and solver of mysteries, you are unexpectedly handed a piece of paper that contains a secret, encoded message. The mysterious person who hands you the message says, "A treasure is hidden at a location that I cannot reveal right now. Meet me at that location on a specific, special day, and I will reveal to you the hidden treasure." Besides being a person who enjoys solving mysteries, you have always wanted to find a hidden treasure. You are eager to discover the secrets that are hidden in the secret message. You decide that you'll use Python to decode the secret message and find the location and date that can lead to hidden treasure!
