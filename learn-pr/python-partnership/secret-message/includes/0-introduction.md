As a novice sleuth and solver of mysteries, you receive a special delivery envelope with a secret, encoded message inside. On the outside of the envelope is a handwritten note that reads, "A treasure is hidden at a location that I cannot reveal right now. Meet me at that location on a specific, special day, and I will reveal to you the hidden treasure." Besides being a person who enjoys solving mysteries, you have always wanted to find a hidden treasure. You are eager to discover the secrets that are hidden in the message. You decide that you'll use Python to decode the secret message and find the location and date that can lead to a hidden treasure!
