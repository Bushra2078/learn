Unsurprisingly, the role of a data scientist primarily involves exploring and analyzing data. The results of an analysis might form the basis of a report or a machine learning model, but it all begins with data, with R being one of the most popular programming languages for data scientists. R can be used for many purposes and prides itself in being an elegant and beautiful environment designed to support data science. 

After decades of open-source development, R provides extensive functionality with a massive set of powerful statistical modeling, machine learning, visualization and data wrangling packages. For instance: 

- Tidyverse is a collection of R packages that make data science faster, easier and more fun. 
- Tidymodels is a collection of R packages for modeling and statistical analysis. 
- TensorFlow for R and Torch for R supply machine learning and deep learning capabilities.

Usually, a data analysis project is designed to establish insights around a particular scenario or to test a hypothesis. 

For example, suppose a university professor collects data from their students, including the number of lectures attended, the hours spent studying, and the final grade achieved on the end of term exam. The professor could analyze the data to determine if there's a relationship between the amount of studying a student undertakes and the final grade they achieve. The professor might use the data to test a hypothesis that only students who study for a minimum number of hours can expect to achieve a passing grade.
