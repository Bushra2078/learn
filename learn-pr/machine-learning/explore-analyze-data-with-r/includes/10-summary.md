Now, itâ€™s time we wrapped it up! Congratulations on finishing the first module. 

In this module, you learned how to use R to explore, visualize, and manipulate data. Data exploration is at the core of data science, and is a key element in data analysis and machine learning.  

## Challenge: Analyze flight data 

If the exercises in this module have inspired you to try exploring data for yourself, why not take on the challenge of a real-world dataset containing flight records from the US Department of Transportation? You'll find the challenge in the [Flights Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics/blob/master/challenges/01%20-%20Flights%20Challenge.ipynb) notebook! 

> [!NOTE]
> The time to complete this optional challenge is not included in the estimated time for this module - you can spend as little or as much time on it as you like!
