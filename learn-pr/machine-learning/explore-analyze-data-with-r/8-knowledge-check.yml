  questions:
  - content: You have a tibble/data frame with the dimension [20, 2]. What does this tell you about the tibble? 
    choices:
    - content: The tibble consists of 20 rows and 2 columns.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That is correct. A data frame with the dimension 20, 2 means that it has 2 columns each with 20 elements. This gives the data frame a rectangular structure of 20 rows and 2 columns. 
    - content: The tibble contains 2 columns, with the values 2 and 20.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is incorrect. A data frame with the dimension 20, 2 means that it has 2 columns each with 20 elements. This gives the data frame a rectangular structure of 20 rows and 2 columns. 
    - content: The tibble contains 20 rows, all with the value 2.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is incorrect. A data frame with the dimension 20, 2 means that it has 2 columns each with 20 elements. This gives the data frame a rectangular structure of 20 rows and 2 columns.
  - content: You have a data frame named df_sales containing daily sales data. The data frame contains the following columns - year, month, day_of_month, sales_total. You want to find the average sales_total value. Which code should you use? 
    choices:
    - content: df_sales %>% pull(sales_total) %>% avg()
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is incorrect. Use the mean() function and not avg() to return the average. 
    - content: mean(sales_total$df_sales)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is incorrect. The accessor (`$`) is used to extract a single column of a data frame. As such the data frame is on the left of the operator.
    - content: mean(df_sales$sales_total)
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That is correct. The accessor (`$`) extracts the elements in the sales_total column of df_sales data frame. These are then passed on to the mean() function that computes the average.  
  - content: You have a data frame containing data about daily ice cream sales. You use the R function cor to compare the avg_temp and units_sold columns, and get a result of 0.97. What does this result indicate?
    choices:
    - content: On the day with the maximum units_sold value, the avg_temp value was 0.97.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is incorrect. The cor function returns the correlation between two numeric columns.
    - content: Days with high avg_temp values tend to coincide with days that have high units_sold values.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That is correct. The corr method returns the correlation, and a value near 1 indicates a positive correlation. 
    - content: The units_sold value is, on average, 97% of the avg_temp value.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is incorrect. The cor function returns the correlation between two numeric columns.
