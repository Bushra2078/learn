In this module, you learned how to use classification to create a machine learning model that predicts categories or classes. You then used the amazing tidymodels framework in R to train and evaluate a classification model by using various algorithms. You preprocessed data, tuned some hyperparameters, and made better predictions.

Tidymodels and scikit-learn (Python) are popular frameworks for writing code to train classification models. You can also create machine learning solutions for classification by using the graphical tools in Azure Machine Learning. 

To learn more about no-code development of classification models by using Machine Learning, see the [Create a classification model with Azure Machine Learning designer](/training/modules/create-classification-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/) module.
