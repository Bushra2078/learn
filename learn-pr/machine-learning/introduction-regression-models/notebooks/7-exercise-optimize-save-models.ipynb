        "You trained a model with data that was loaded straight from a source file, with only moderately successful results. In practice, it's common to perform some preprocessing of the data to make it easier for the algorithm to fit a model to it.\n",

        "In this section, you'll explore the Tidymodels package [recipes](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/). This package helps you preprocess your data before you train your model. A recipe is an object that defines a series of steps for data processing.\n",

        "#### Scale numeric features\n",
        "\n",
        "Numeric features need to be normalized so that they're on the same scale. Normalizing prevents features with large values from producing coefficients that disproportionately affect the predictions. For example, suppose your data includes the following numeric features:\n",

You can also use the mean and standard deviation of a normally distributed variable to maintain the same spread of values on a different scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Encode categorical variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Encoding involves translating a column with categorical values into one or more numeric columns that take the place of the original.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning models work best with numeric features rather than text values. Generally, you need to convert categorical features into numeric representations. For example, suppose your data includes the following categorical feature:\n",

        "|  1   |\n",
        "|  2   |\n",
        "\n",
        "Another common technique is to create *dummy* or *indicator variables*. They replace the original categorical feature with numeric columns whose values are either 1 or 0, as shown:\n",

        "|    L     |  0  |  1  |\n",
        "\n",
        "In R, the convention is to exclude a column for the first factor level. In this case, the factor is *S*. The reasons for this include *simplicity* and reducing *linear dependencies*.
