In this module, you learned how to use Python to explore, visualize, and manipulate data. Data exploration is at the core of data science, and is a key element in data analysis and machine learning.

In the hands-on exercise in this module, you used a Jupyter notebook in an Azure Machine Learning workspace. Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service that you can use to run data experiments, and create and manage machine learning solutions. After completing the [Create machine learning models](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-machine-learn-models/) learning path, you can learn more about Azure Machine Learning in the following learning paths:

- [Create no-code predictive models with Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-no-code-predictive-models-azure-machine-learning/)
- [Build AI solutions with Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/)



> [!NOTE]
> Machine learning is a subset of data science that deals with predictive modeling. In other words, machine learning uses data to creates predictive models, in order to predict unknown values. You might use machine learning to predict how much food a supermarket needs to order, or to identify plants in photographs.
>
> Machine learning works by identifying relationships between data values that describe characteristics of something—its *features*, such as the height and color of a plant—and the value we want to predict—the *label*, such as the species of plant. These relationships are built into a model through a *training* process.
