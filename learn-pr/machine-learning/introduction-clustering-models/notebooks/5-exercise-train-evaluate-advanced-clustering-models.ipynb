        "5.  When the clusters stop changing, the algorithm has *converged*, defining the locations of the clusters. Note that the random starting point for the centroids means that re-running the algorithm could result in slightly different clusters. So training usually involves multiple iterations, reinitializing the centroids each time, and the model with the best WCSS is selected.\n",
