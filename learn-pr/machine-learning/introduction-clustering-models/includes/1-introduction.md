*Clustering* is the process of grouping objects with similar objects. For example, the following image shows a collection of 2D coordinates that have been clustered into three categories - top left (yellow), bottom (red), and top right (blue).

Clustering is considered an unsupervised method of grouping, in which training is done without labels. Clustering models identify examples that have a similar collection of features. In the preceding image, examples that are in a similar location are grouped together. 

Clustering is common and useful for exploring new data, where patterns between data points, such as high-level categories, are not yet known. It's used in many fields that need to automatically label complex data, including analysis of social networks, brain connectivity, and spam filtering.
