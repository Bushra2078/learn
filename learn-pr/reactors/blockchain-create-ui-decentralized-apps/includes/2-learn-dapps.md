A [dapp](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/?azure-portal=true), or a
decentralized application,  uses smart contracts which
execute on a blockchain network and allows users to interact with the application interface either through a web browser or mobile app.

## How do dapps operate

[Dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) differ from traditional applications in that they do not rely on a centralized server network, but instead operate on a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain network.

A dapp can have frontend code written in any language, just like a traditional web app, that can make calls to its backend. With dapps, the backend are smart contracts that are executed on a blockchain.

Dapps are:

- **Decentralized** which means that they execute independently on a decentralized network and not controlled by a centralized authority.
- **Deterministic** which means that they perform the same function independent of which environment executes the code.
- **[Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true)**, which means that they can perform any action which can be coded.
- **Isolated** which means they are executed in a virtual environment known as
[Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) so that bugs or other problems won't affect other blocks or the normal functioning of the blockchain network.

## Benefits of dapp development

Outside of providing a way for users to interact with the blockchain network in an easy and visual way, dapps also provide the additional benefits:

- **Zero downtime** once the underlying smart contract and app are deployed on the blockchain network, the network will always be available to serve clients looking to interact with the contract.
- **Privacy** users don't need to provide their true real-world identity to interact with a dapp.
- **Censorship resistance** no entity on the network can prevent users from using the dapp in any way.
- **Data integrity** since data stored on the blockchain is immutable, it is not possible for bad actors to modify or falsify data and transactions.
- **Verifiable behavior** smart contracts and their dapps are guaranteed to execute in a predictable way without a central authority.

## Examples of dapps

Just like blockchain solutions are being created in nearly every industry, dapps are becoming more popular in major industries as well. Most notably, there has been a lot of movement in the areas of finance, arts and collectibles, gaming, and technology. Here are examples across each of those industries to check out and inspire you as you begin to create your own dapps.

[Augur](https://augur.net?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) is a platform where you can bet on things like sports, economics, politics, and entertainment. The user interface allows you to trade and to view reporting on both the open and closed bets. The UI for betting is still in progress at this time.

[OpenSea](https://opensea.io?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) is a platform where you can buy, sell, and discover limited-edition goods. The dapp allows users to browse items and make an offer or buy for the price listed. Users can also list their goods for sale.

[Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) is a gaming dapp where you can breed, collect, and sell unique cryptographic kittens. Aditionally, you can do things like solve puzzles, earn rewards, and play games with your kitties.

[Brave](https://brave.com/) is a fast and private browser that allows you to earn tokens called BAT that can be donated or converted into a currency of your choice.
