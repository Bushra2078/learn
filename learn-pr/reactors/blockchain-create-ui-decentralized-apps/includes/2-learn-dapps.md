A [dapp](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/?azure-portal=true), or a decentralized application, uses smart contracts. Smart contracts run on a blockchain network and allow users to interact with the application interface through a web browser or a mobile app.

## How dapps operate

Dapps differ from traditional applications in that they don't rely on a centralized server network. Instead, they operate on a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain network.

A dapp can have front-end code written in any language, just like a traditional web app, that can make calls to its back end. With dapps, the back end consists of smart contracts that run on a blockchain.

Dapps are:

- **Decentralized**. They run independently on a decentralized network and are not controlled by a centralized authority.
- **Deterministic**. They perform the same function no matter which environment runs the code.
- **[Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true)**. They can perform any action that can be coded.
- **Isolated**. They're run in a virtual environment called an
[Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true). That way, bugs or other problems won't affect other blocks or the normal functioning of the blockchain network.

## Benefits of dapp development

Dapps help users to interact with the blockchain network in an easy and visual way. They also provide these benefits:

- **Zero downtime**. After the underlying smart contract and app are deployed on the blockchain network, the network will always be available to serve clients that want to interact with the contract.
- **Privacy**. Users don't need to provide their real-world identity to interact with a dapp.
- **Censorship resistance**. No entity on the network can prevent users from using the dapp in any way.
- **Data integrity**. Because data stored on the blockchain is immutable, bad actors can't modify or falsify data and transactions.
- **Verifiable behavior**. Smart contracts and their dapps are guaranteed to run in a predictable way without a central authority.
