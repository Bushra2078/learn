In past modules, we introduced the [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/?azure-portal=true), a set of tools that make blockchain development easier. And we've used [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle?azure-portal=true) and [Ganache CLI](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache?azure-portal=true) to help with the development, deployment, and testing of smart contracts.

This unit introduces the next member of the Truffle Suite, [Drizzle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/drizzle?azure-portal=true). Drizzle makes writing dapp user interfaces more predictable and easier through its collection of front-end libraries.

### About Drizzle

Drizzle is built with JavaScript. It works well with and has great support for [React](https://reactjs.org/?azure-portal=true), which is the most popular JavaScript library for building front-end user interfaces. However, there's also an option to use front-end JavaScript frameworks like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org?azure-portal=true) or [Angular](https://angular.io?azure-portal=true).

Drizzle helps to synchronize and manage smart contract data. This synchronization is significant so that the blockchain data stays in aligned with your app interface. It uses a [Redux](https://redux.js.org/?azure-portal=true) store. Redux is a state container for JavaScript apps that makes it easy to track all transactions. Plus, it helps applications behave consistently for users and any environment they use.

Drizzle apps interact with smart contacts by using a JSON-RPC layer called the Web3 API.

[JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification?azure-portal=true) is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It's stateless, lightweight, and uses JSON for the payload. JSON-RPC specifies a set of data structures and defines the rules around processing those structures.

To talk to an Ethereum node from a JavaScript application, the [Web3 API](https://web3js.readthedocs.io?azure-portal=true) is needed. Web3 is the Ethereum-compatible JavaScript API and has bindings that are built through the JSON-RPC protocol.

## Drizzle components

Before we get into how to use Drizzle, let's focus on the main libraries that you can use to build your dapp.

Drizzle is modular, which means you can use as much or as little of the library portions as you want.

The three core packages are:

- **drizzle**: Library you use to instantiate web3, account, and contract. You also use the library to connect the smart contracts to the dapp.
- **drizzle-react**: Library that makes usable React components by abstracting the core Drizzle functionality.
- **drizzle-react-components**: Library that includes user interface components for common dapp functions. This library includes the ContractData, ContractForm, and LoadingContainer React components.

## Install and use Drizzle

Drizzle can be installed with the help of the node package manager (npm). To install Drizzle, you need to go to your terminal and type: `npm install @drizzle/store`.

Then when you're ready to use Drizzle, you can import the packages that you want to use in your project like the following example:

```javascript
import { Drizzle } from "@drizzle/store";
import { newContextComponents } from "@drizzle/react-components";
import { DrizzleContext } from "@drizzle/react-plugin";
```
