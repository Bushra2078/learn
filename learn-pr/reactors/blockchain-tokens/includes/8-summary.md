In this module, you learned what contracts are and how you can write token contracts by using OpenZeppelin. You should now have an understanding of why you would want to use token contracts, and perhaps have ideas about other types of contracts you can write that use tokens.

## Resources

For continued learning, see the [OpenZeppelin token documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/tokens?azure-portal=true). Find more examples of contract standards and explore how to write more contract tokens on your own.
