The token is one of blockchain's most powerful and often misunderstood tools. Tokens typically are misunderstood because a blockchain token can represent almost anything that we want to assign a value to, whether that thing is virtual or a real-world, tangible object.

A token can grant special permissions to a user on a platform, grant exclusive access to a service, or it can show ownership. A token also can represent cryptocurrencies that have monetary value. Let's dive into the history of tokens and explore various use cases to demonstrate what exactly a token is and what you can do with them.

## History of tokens

Tokens are not a new thing. Tokens existed long before the emergence of blockchain.

In their long history, tokens have represented any form of economic value. Shells and beads probably were the earliest types of tokens, as they were used to trade goods with. Present-day types of tokens include casinos chips, vouchers, airline points, stock certificates, concert entry tokens, dinner reservations, ID cards, and club memberships. Really, the list of possible token uses can go on and on somewhat endlessly.

Even our typical fiat currency, which includes cash and coins, is a type of token. The point is, you can accumulate tokens, and then trade them in to get something of value or some service in return.

In computing, tokens are used to allow a right to perform some operation or to manage access rights.  

A web browser, for example, sends tokens to websites when we surf the internet. These tokens contain information about our computers, like the browser and IP address. Another examples of computer tokens are QR codes. QR codes are scanned, and then they redirect us to a webpage or some service.

## Blockchain tokens

Blockchain tokens combine concepts of more general tokens: ownership rights to some property, service access, or monetary value. This property or service can be public, like an Ethereum network that anyone can join and participate in. Or, the property or service can be private, like a house that is purchased by an owner, or points on your account that you trade in to purchase items.

Blockchain tokens represent a set of rules that are programmed in a smart contract. Every token belongs to a blockchain address that identifies it uniquely. These tokens are accessible by using a [crypto wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) so that only the person who has the private key for that address can access those tokens.

The Ethereum blockchain platform is based on the use of tokens that can be bought, sold, and traded. Tokens are like Ether (ETH), but they might have different design decisions and purposes, and they help operate different decentralized apps (DAPPS) and facilitate crypto-economics of different blockchain ecosystems.

Augur is an example. [Augur](https://www.augur.net/) is a network that functions as a prediction market. You can think of it as a betting platform. Augur has its own token named REP. Using a token in Augur is no different than using a token, perhaps, to take public transportation. To use public transportation, on the one hand, you can use fiat or local currency, like the Canadian dollar (CAD), which sometimes also comes in coins. On the other hand, you can use, for example, Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) tokens. Each TTC token allows you to take one subway ride. You can purchase TTC tokens by using CAD (just like you can purchase REP by using ETH), but they are not the same thing. TTC tokens are specifically for the ecosystem of Toronto Transit, and REP tokens are for the Augur ecosystem.

## Two categories of blockchain tokens

There are different kinds of tokens available, but tokens usually are in one of two categories:

- **Fungible**. Fungible tokens have these characteristics:
  - They are *equivalent*.
  - They are *exchangeable*.
  - It matters how *many* you have.
- **Non-fungible**. Non-fungible tokens have these characteristics:
  - They are *unique*.
  - They are *distinct*.
  - It matters *which ones* you have.

When you break it down, blockchain tokens essentially are smart contracts that make use of the Ethereum blockchain. Everything in Ethereum can be represented as a smart contract, and there are no rules that restrict what smart contracts do. So, the community has developed standards to document how a token contract can operate with other contracts. The standards also describe the implementation details of each token type.
