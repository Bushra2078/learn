[OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) provides tools that you can use to write, deploy, and manage decentralized applications. It's an open-source tool that provides reliability and security with the products it provides.

OpenZeppelin offers two products: the contracts library and the SDK.

## Contracts

The [contracts library](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts) gives you access to a robust set of modular and reusable smart contracts for the Ethereum network. The smart contracts are written in Solidity. The benefits of using OpenZeppelin contracts is that they have been thoroughly tested, audited, and community-reviewed.

OpenZeppelin is the most popular library source in the industry for smart contracts, and itâ€™s open source. When you use OpenZeppelin contracts, you'll learn the best practices for developing smart contracts. There are a variety of contract types available, including these types:

- **Access Control**: Decide who can perform actions.
- **Tokens**: Create tradeable assets.
- **Gas Station Network**: Your users can use contracts without having to pay for the gas (fees).
- **Utilities**: Use eneric, useful tools.

Although we'll use only the token contracts in this module, it's good to be aware of the other contract resources that are available.

## SDK

The other product that OpenZeppelin provides is the [SDK](https://openzeppelin.com/sdk/). The SDK offers a command line interface (CLI) to make it easier to manage smart contract development. You can save hours of development time by using the CLI to compile, upgrade, and deploy smart contracts. The CLI provides support for Ethereum and other Ethereum Virtual Machine-powered blockchains. The commands are intuitive and interactive to help guide you through the development process.

We won't use the SDK in this module, but it is a tool you can consider exploring on your own and using for future blockchain development.
