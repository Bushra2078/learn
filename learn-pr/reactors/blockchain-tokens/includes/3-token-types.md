[Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/?azure-portal=true) (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. Community members can propose new standards for all aspects of the Ethereum platform through EIPs.

Token standards are defined in the [Ethereum Request for Comments](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc?azure-portal=true) (ERCs). Although new standards are continuously being proposed and accepted, standards for four primary ERC types have been widely adopted:

- **ERC20**
- **ERC721**
- **ERC777**
- **ERC1155**

Let's explore each type of token. We'll take a moment to understand what makes each one significant and unique.

## ERC20

The [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20?azure-portal=true) token is the most widely known and used. ERC20 is the technical standard that's used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to implement tokens. ERC20 has a simple interface for basic tokens.

An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens. Any one token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behaviors associated with them. This characteristic makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like currency exchange, voting rights, and staking.

## ERC721

[ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721?azure-portal=true) is the top solution for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Like all other tokens, NFTs represent ownership both of virtual and physical assets. These assets are likely to include:

- Collectible items, like antiques, cards, or art
- Physical assets, like houses or cars
- Negative-value assets, like loans

Each token is unique and has ownership and status that must be tracked.

The ERC721 token is a more complex standard than ERC20. When the core functions have some similarities, each one has function arguments that specify the token ID.

## ERC777

[ERC777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777?azure-portal=true) is a richer standard that is used for fungible tokens. It can be used for new use cases and to build on learnings from previous token standards. It is backward-compatible with ERC20, which means you can interact with ERC777 tokens as if they were ERC20 tokens. You can use ERC777 tokens for interactions that are more complex trades.

## ERC1155

[ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155?azure-portal=true) is a standard that's used to manage multiple types of tokens. A single contract can represent multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens.

ERC1155 draws on ideas from ERC20, ERC721, and ERC777.

The design of the ERC1155 token type allows for massive gas savings, for a couple reasons. (In Ethereum, *gas* refers to a fee or pricing value.) First, you can use this token contract for multiple tokens, which means fewer deployments with less complexity. It also has batched operations, so a single function call can be simpler and less gas-intensive.
