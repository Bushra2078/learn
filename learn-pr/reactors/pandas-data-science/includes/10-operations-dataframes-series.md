Index and column alignment gets maintained in operations between a `DataFrame` and a `Series` as well. To see this, consider a common operation in data science, wherein we find the difference of a `DataFrame` and one of its rows. Because pandas inherits ufuncs from NumPy, pandas will compute the difference row-wise by default:

```Python
df3 = pd.DataFrame(rng.randint(10, size=(3, 4)), columns=list('WXYZ'))
df3
```

The output is:

```Output
|    | W  | X  | Y  | Z  |
--------------------------
| 0  | 3  | 8  | 2  | 4  |
| 1  | 2  | 6  | 4  | 8  |
| 2  | 6  | 1  | 3  | 8  |
```

Another example:

```Python
df3 - df3.iloc[0]
```

The output is:

```Output
|    | W   | X   | Y  | Z  |
----------------------------
| 0  | 0   | 0   | 0  | 0  |
| 1  | -1  | -2  | 2  | 4  |
| 2  | 3   | -7  | 1  | 4  |
```

But what if you need to operate column-wise? You can do this by using object methods and specifying the `axis` keyword.

```Python
df3.subtract(df3['X'], axis=0)
```

The output is:

```Output
|    | W   | X  | Y   | Z   |
-----------------------------
| 0  | -5  | 0  | -6  | -4  |
| 1  | -4  | 0  | -2  | 2   |
| 2  | 5   | 0  | 2   | 7   |
```

And when you do operations between `DataFrames` and `Series` operations, you still get automatic index alignment:

```Python
halfrow = df3.iloc[0, ::2]
halfrow
```

The output is:

```Output
W    3
Y    2
Name: 0, dtype: int64
```

Note that the output from that operation was transposed. That was so that we can subtract it from the `DataFrame`:

```Python
df3 - halfrow
```

The output is:

```Output
|    |  W   |  X   |  Y   |  Z   |
----------------------------------
| 0  | 0.0  | NaN  | 0.0  | NaN  |
| 1  | -1.0 | NaN  | 2.0  | NaN  |
| 2  | 3.0  | NaN  | 1.0  | NaN  |
```

Remember, pandas preserves and aligns indices and columns so preserve data context. This will be of huge help to you in our next module when we look at data cleaning and preparation.
