A huge part of data science is manipulating data in order to analyze it. (One rule of thumb is that 80 percent of any data science project will be concerned with cleaning and organizing the data for the project.) So it makes sense to learn the tools that pandas provides for handling data in `Series`, and especially `DataFrames`. Because both of those data structures are ordered, let's first start by taking a closer look at what gives them their structure: the `Index`.

## Index objects in pandas

Both `Series` and `DataFrames` in pandas have explicit indices that enable you to reference and modify data in them. These indices are actually objects themselves. The `Index` object can be thought of as either an immutable array or a fixed-size set.

It's worth the time to get to know the properties of the `Index` object. Let's return to an example from earlier in the section to examine these properties.

```python
series_example = pd.Series([-0.5, 0.75, 1.0, -2], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
ind = series_example.index
ind
```

The output is:

```Output
Index(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], dtype='object')
```

The `Index` works a lot like an array. You've already seen how to use standard Python indexing notation to retrieve values or slices:

```python
ind[1]
```

The output is:

```Output
'b'
```

Another example:

```python
ind[::2]
```

The output is:

```Output
Index(['a', 'c'], dtype='object')
```

But `Index` objects are immutable, and can't be modified via the normal means:

```python
ind[1] = 0
```

The error output is:

```Error
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-34-906a9fa1424c> in <module>
----> 1 ind[1] = 0

/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/indexes/base.py in __setitem__(self, key, value)
   2063 
   2064     def __setitem__(self, key, value):
-> 2065         raise TypeError("Index does not support mutable operations")
   2066 
   2067     def __getitem__(self, key):

TypeError: Index does not support mutable operations
```

This immutability is a good thing. It makes it safer to share indices between multiple `Series` or `DataFrames` without the potential for problems arising from inadvertent index modification.

### Try it yourself

In addition to being array-like, an `Index` also behaves like a fixed-size set. This includes following many of the conventions used by Python's built-in set data structure, so that unions, intersections, differences, and other combinations can be computed in a familiar way. Let's play around with this to see it in action.

```python
ind_odd = pd.Index([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
ind_prime = pd.Index([2, 3, 5, 7, 11])
```

Try the following:
- The intersection (`ind_odd & ind_prime`)
- The union (`ind_odd | ind_prime`)
- The symmetric difference (`ind_odd ^ ind_prime`) of `ind_odd` and `ind_prime`

  ```python
  ind_odd & ind_prime
  ```

  ```Output
  Int64Index([3, 5, 7], dtype='int64')
  ```

  ```python
  ind_odd | ind_prime
  ```

  ```Output
  Int64Index([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], dtype='int64')
  ```

  ```python
  ind_odd ^ ind_prime
  ```

  ```Output
  Int64Index([1, 2, 9, 11], dtype='int64')
  ```

***

You can also access these operations via object methods, such as `ind_odd.intersection(ind_prime)`. The following table lists some useful `Index` methods and properties.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `append` | Concatenate with additional `Index` objects, producing a new `Index`. |
| `diff` | Compute set difference as an `Index`. |
| `drop` | Compute new `Index` by deleting passed values. |
| `insert` | Compute new `Index` by inserting element at index `i`. |
| `is_monotonic` | Returns `True` if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element. |
| `is_unique` | Returns `True` if the `Index` has no duplicate values. |
| `isin` | Compute a Boolean array that indicates whether each value is contained in the passed collection. |
| `unique` | Compute the array of unique values in order of appearance. |
