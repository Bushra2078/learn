As you begin to work in data science, operating on data is imperative. Another aspect of pandas that makes it a compelling tool for many data scientists is pandas' ability to perform efficient, element-wise operations on data. pandas builds on `ufuncs` from NumPy to supply these capabilities. Then it extends them to provide additional power for data manipulation. For example:

- For unary operations (such as negation and trigonometric functions), `ufuncs` in pandas preserve index and column labels in the output.
- For binary operations (such as addition and multiplication), pandas automatically aligns indices when it passes objects to `ufuncs`.

These critical features mean that data retains its context when operated on. Even more importantly, these features help reduce errors significantly when you combine data from multiple sources.

## Index preservation

pandas is explicitly designed to work with NumPy. As a result, all NumPy `ufuncs` will work on pandas `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.

You can see this more clearly if you create a simple `Series` and `DataFrame` of random numbers on which to operate.

```python
rng = np.random.RandomState(42)
ser_example = pd.Series(rng.randint(0, 10, 4))
ser_example
```

The output is: 

```Output
0    6
1    3
2    7
3    4
dtype: int64
```

Did you notice the NumPy function you used with the variable `rng`? By specifying a seed for the random-number generator, you get the same result each time. This can be a useful trick when you need to produce psuedo-random output that must be replicatable by others. (Go ahead and re-run the code cell above a couple of times to convince yourself that it produces the same output each time.)

```python
df_example = pd.DataFrame(rng.randint(0, 10, (3, 4)),
                  columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
df_example
```

The output is: 

```Output
|    | A  | B  | C  | D  |
--------------------------
| 0  | 6  | 9  | 2  | 6  |
| 1  | 7  | 4  | 3  | 7  |
| 2  | 7  | 2  | 5  | 4  |
```

Let's apply a `ufunc` to our example `Series`:

```python
np.exp(ser_example)
```

The output is: 

```Output
0     403.428793
1      20.085537
2    1096.633158
3      54.598150
dtype: float64
```

The same thing happens with a slightly more complex operation on our example `DataFrame`:

```python
np.cos(df_example * np.pi / 4)
```

The output is: 

```Output
|    |       A       |        B       |        C       |        D       |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 0  | -1.836970e-16 | 7.071068e-01   | 6.123234e-17   | -1.836970e-16  |
| 1  | 7.071068e-01  | -1.000000e+00  | -7.071068e-01  | 7.071068e-01   |
| 2  | 7.071068e-01  | 6.123234e-17   | -7.071068e-01  | -1.000000e+00  |
```

You can use all of the `ufuncs` that we discussed earlier in the same way.

## Index alignment

When you perform a binary operation on two `Series` or `DataFrame` objects, pandas aligns indices in the process of performing the operation. This is essential when you're working with incomplete data (and data is usually incomplete), but it's helpful to see this in action to better understand it.
