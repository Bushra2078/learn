title: 'Conditional probability and Bayes classification for dataset analysis'
summary: Learn how to use conditional probability and Bayes classification to analyze an email dataset for spam.
abstract:  | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Learn the strengths and limitations of conditional probability and naive Bayes machine learning.
  - Use pandas to evaluate a dataset of email messages for spam or ham.
  - Use Matplotlib to generate a word cloud, and then use Natural Language Toolkit and scikit-learn for deeper analysis.
  - Use the naive Bayes classifier to classify the data in a spam dataset.
