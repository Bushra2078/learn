Python code does not have to reside in notebooks. Simple programs can provide a useful tool for investigating your data. To see this in action, open the program Sec2-1-k-Means.py in the GitHub repository in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The program is largely the code from earlier in this notebook. Now run Sec2-1-k-Means.py from the command line interface on your local computer. It will ask for the number of clusters and the file path for the USDA dataset that you have been using in this section.

>The performance of our naive Bayes model helps underscore the algorithm's popularity, particularly for spam detection. Even untuned, we got good performance, performance that would only continue to improve in production as users submitted more examples of spam messages.
