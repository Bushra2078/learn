Up until now, we have only examined *supervised* machine learning (ML), in which we provide labeled training data for the algorithm. *k*-means clustering is the first *unsupervised* ML algorithm that we have dealt with: we provide the algorithm with a set of ![$n$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n&mode=inline) data points and tell the algorithm that we want that data partitioned into ![$k$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k&mode=inline) clusters that provide the best separation between clusters.

The *k*-means algorithm randomly assigns ![$k$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k&mode=inline) *centroids* (or geometric centers of subsets of the dataset as measured through [Euclidean distance](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Distance.html)) to the data and then iteratively moves those centroids around the feature space until it converges on an arrangement of the centroids the minimizes the variance within the clusters.

> **Learning objective:** By the end of this section, you should have a basic understanding of the kinds of results the *k*-means algorithm can produce and have some idea about how you can interpret those results.
