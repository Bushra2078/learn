What sorts of foods populate the clusters? We'll examine that question in greater depth later on. But we can get some sense of our clusters just by looking at the mean values for each of them.

```python
nutr_df.groupby('Cluster').mean()
```

The output is:

We can quickly see that cluster 2 encompasses fatty foods (high `Lipid_Tot_(g)` values). Clusters 0 and 1 have similar mean protein and lipid amounts. An easy-to-see differentiation between those clusters is their relative carbohydrate and sugar levels. The relative carbohydrate and sugar levels in cluster 1 are significantly higher than those in cluster 0.

We can look at these high-level differences in a little more detail by using the `describe()` method. Honestly, this is a little cumbersome because of the size of the DataFrame.

```python
nutr_df.groupby('Cluster').describe()
```

The output is:

We can also predict the label for new or hypothetical observations. Let's provide the nutritional details for Gjetost cheese and see which cluster our model places it in. (Gjetost cheese is one of our discarded entries from the original DataFrame, with `NaN` values entered as follows.)

```python
newcase = [[1021,
            13.44,
            466.0,
            9.65,
            29.51,
            4.75,
            42.65,
            0.0,
            1.50,
            400.0,
            0.52,
            70.0,
            444.0,
            1409.0,
            600.0,
            1.14,
            0.08,
            0.04,
            14.5,
            0.0,
            0.315,
            1.382,
            0.813,
            3.351,
            0.271,
            5.0,
            0.0,
            5.0,
            15.4,
            2.42,
            1113.0,
            334.0,
            0,
            20,
            0,
            0.5,
            22,
            2.4,
            19.16,
            7.879,
            0.938,
            94.0,
            28.35]]
```

Then:

```python
kmeansmodel.predict(newcase)
```

The output is:

```Output
array([1])
```

The output indicates that Gjetost cheese falls under cluster 1.

### Try it yourself

Alter the values for Gjetost cheese in the `newcase` array to see what it takes to get that array classified into cluster 0 or cluster 2.

**SARAH TBD** - add hint content?

Remember that there is a method to this wall of numbers. Each coordinate is a point in 43-dimensional space, so an array of 43 values represents each centroid.

Let's now add back in our descriptive features so that we can see which food groups are in our clusters.

```python
merged_df = nutr_df.join(desc_df)
merged_df.head()
```

If not, review the documentation for [`pandas.DataFrame.loc`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html?azure-portal=true) and [`pandas.Series.value_counts`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html?azure-portal=true).

### Try it yourself

Find the `FoodGroup` value counts for clusters 1 and 2.

<details>
  <summary>Hint <i>(expand to reveal)</i></summary>

  Solution:

  ```python
  merged_df.loc[nutr_df['Cluster'] == 1]['FoodGroup'].value_counts()
  ```

  The output is:

  ```Output

  And:

  ```python
  merged_df.loc[nutr_df['Cluster'] == 2]['FoodGroup'].value_counts()

  The output is:

Some of the entries in our clusters makes sense, and others look kind of like the contents of a grab bag. Part of the reason is that the k-means algorithm has to draw arbitrary boundaries between clusters. There will be a lot of entries in all clusters that are right on the edge and could belong to two (or more) clusters. To reduce some of this noise, we can sort these by distance from centroid of the respective clusters and look at the entries closest to the centroids.

```python
import numpy as np

distances = kmeansmodel.fit_transform(X)
merged_df['Distance'] = np.min(distances, axis=1)
merged_df.head()
```

We can now sort `FoodGroup` value counts by distance to the cluster's centroid. That task can make the lists of principal food types in each cluster more intuitive.

```python
merged_df.loc[nutr_df['Cluster'] == 0].sort_values(by='Distance')['FoodGroup'][:500].value_counts()
```

The output is:

```Output
Breakfast Cereals                    33
Snacks                                5
Vegetables and Vegetable Products     4
Beef Products                         3

> ### Question
>
> Look over the Python in the preceding code cell. Does the syntax make sense? If not, review the documentation for [`pandas.DataFrame.sort_values`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html?azure-portal=true) and [slicing ranges in pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges?azure-portal=true).

### Try it yourself

Find the sorted `FoodGroup` value counts for clusters 1 and 2.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Because the sizes of the clusters differ, try a variety of ranges for your slices.

  Possible solutions:

  ```python
  merged_df.loc[nutr_df['Cluster'] == 1].sort_values(by='Distance')['FoodGroup'][:30].value_counts()
  ```

  The output is:

  ```Output
  Vegetables and Vegetable Products    29
  Spices and Herbs                      1
  Name: FoodGroup, dtype: int64
  ```

  And:

  ```python
  merged_df.loc[nutr_df['Cluster'] == 2].sort_values(by='Distance')['FoodGroup'][:200].value_counts()
  ```

  The output is:

  ```Output
  Vegetables and Vegetable Products    64
  Fruits and Fruit Juices              50
  Baby Foods                           22
