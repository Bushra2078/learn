title: Deep learning with facial recognition
summary: Learn how to prepare and train a neural network model to use for classification of a dataset.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Use NumPy to analyze and visualize the contents of a dataset.
  - Use Keras to train a neural network.
  - Use Keras to check for training accuracy and validity accuracy in a neural network model.
  - Add dropout during model training to help neural networks generalize better and increase validation accuracy.
  - Use a neural network for classification of a dataset.

  Complementary content for Microsoft Reactor Workshops.
prerequisites: |
  - Text classifications with Naive Bayes
  - Principal component analysis (PCA)
  - Support vector machines with facial recognition
