[Deep learning](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning?azure-portal=true) is a branch of machine learning that relies on [neural networks](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network?azure-portal-true) to perform predictive analytics. Neural networks are built with libraries such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?azure-portal=true) and [keras](https://keras.io/?azure-portal=true). The latter is an open-source Python library that dramatically simplifies the building of neural networks. Under the hood, it uses TensorFlow and other frameworks to do the heavy lifting. With keras, you can build sophisticated neural networks with just a few lines of code and train them to classify images, analyze text for sentiment, do natural-language processing, and perform other tasks at which deep learning excels.

In this exercise, you will use keras to build a series of neural networks that recognize faces. You will train them with images from the famous [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/?azure-portal=true) (LFW) dataset. Along the way, you will learn the basics of building, training, and evaluating neural networks. You will also learn about [convolutional neural networks](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network?azure-portal=true) (CNNs), which excel at tasks involving computer vision.
