Welcome to the Introduction to Python for Data Science Learning Path! The content in this learning path pairs with in-person workshops that run in [Microsoft Reactors](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/). The learning path and the modules it consists of are standalone learning resources. You don't have to come to a workshop to benefit from these modules.

Throughout this learning path, you will be encouraged to test out Python code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) by using the Python extension and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Set up your environment

To learn most effectively throughout this learning path, we recommend that you set up your environment so you can follow along. 

Complete these steps to set up your environment:

1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). This is free and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Select the stable build for your platform. 
2. Download and install the [Python extension for Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). This will include first installing a supported version of Python.
3. Activate the [Anaconda environment in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) to be able to run Jupyter notebooks.
4. Clone *TBD*.

> [!NOTE]

> **SARAH** - There are several TBDs on this page. I wasn't able to successfully load pandas or NumPy. There might be a gap in the landing path instructions, especially related to how to use Jupyter Notebooks--what files or project to download, what file to create or open to get started running code. Could you check?

## Test your environment

If you have successfully setup your environment with VS Code, Python, and Anaconda you should be able to run a Jupyter notebook inside of VS Code.

Open the cloned repo *TBD*

## Working through this learning path

As you're working through this learning path, you will be encouraged to try out code. Use the files you cloned to do this.
