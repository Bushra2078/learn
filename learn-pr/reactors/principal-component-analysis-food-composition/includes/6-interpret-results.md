What do our vectors mean? Put another way, what kinds of foods populate the different clusters we've discovered among the data?

To see the results, we'll create a pandas series for each component, index the components by feature, and then sort them in decreasing order. A higher number represents a feature that is positively correlated with that vector. Negative numbers represent low correlation.

First, run this code:

```python
vects = fit.components_[:5]
```

Next, run this code:

```python
c1 = pd.Series(vects[0], index=nutr_df.columns)
c1.sort_values(ascending=False)
```

The output is:

Our first cluster is defined by foods that are high in protein and minerals, like selenium and zinc, while also being low in sugars and vitamin C. Even to a nonspecialist, these foods appear to be meat, poultry, or legumes.

Our second group is foods that are high in fiber and folic acid and low in cholesterol.

  <italic>Hint</italic>: To find the sorted output for $c_{3}$, $c_{4}$, and $c_{5}$, remember that Python uses zero-indexing.

  Here's a possible solution:

  ```python
  c3 = pd.Series(vects[2], index=nutr_df.columns)
  c3.sort_values(ascending=False)
  ```

  ```python
  c4 = pd.Series(vects[3], index=nutr_df.columns)
  c4.sort_values(ascending=False)
  ```

  ```python
  c5 = pd.Series(vects[4], index=nutr_df.columns)
  c5.sort_values(ascending=False)

Even without subject matter expertise, is it possible to get a more accurate sense of the kinds of foods that each component defines? Yes! For this reason, we merged the `FoodGroup` column back into `pca_df`. We will sort that DataFrame by the components and count the values from `FoodGroup` for the top items:

```python
pca_df.sort_values(by='c1')['FoodGroup'][:500].value_counts()
```

The output is:

```Output
Vegetables and Vegetable Products    189
Fruits and Fruit Juices              110
Beverages                             70
Sweets                                41
Soups, Sauces, and Gravies            34
Baby Foods                            31
Fats and Oils                          8
Spices and Herbs                       5
Dairy and Egg Products                 4
Breakfast Cereals                      3
Cereal Grains and Pasta                2
Baked Products                         1
Nut and Seed Products                  1
Restaurant Foods                       1
Name: FoodGroup, dtype: int64
```

We can do the same thing for $c_{2}$.

```python
pca_df.sort_values(by='c2')['FoodGroup'][:500].value_counts()
```

The output is:

```Output
Dairy and Egg Products         22
Fats and Oils                   5
Baby Foods                      2
Sausages and Luncheon Meats     1
Soups, Sauces, and Gravies      1
Poultry Products                1
Name: FoodGroup, dtype: int64
```

> [!NOTE]
> The category **Baby Foods** and some other categories might seem to dominate the output. This is a result of all the rows we had to drop because they had `NaN` values. If we look at all of the value counts for the category **FoodGroup**, we'll see that they aren't evenly distributed. Some categories are far more represented than others.

```python
df['FoodGroup'].value_counts()
```

The output is:

```Output
