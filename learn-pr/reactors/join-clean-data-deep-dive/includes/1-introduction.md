As a general rule, data scientists assume that about 80 percent of the time and effort devoted to a project will be spent preparing data for anlaysis. Because most real-world data is split among multiple existing datasets, this invariably means cleaning and joining diffent datasets together in the way that a data scientist needs for analysis. Thus, mastering these skills is essential for undertaking data science.

This section makes extensive use of pandas, the principal Python library for data handling and manipulation. Note that this section assumes some familiarity with pandas and basic Python skills.

In order to provide an experience more like real-world data science, we will use real data taken gathered from theÂ [U.S. Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/usda-national-nutrient-database-for-standard-reference/?azure-portal=true).
