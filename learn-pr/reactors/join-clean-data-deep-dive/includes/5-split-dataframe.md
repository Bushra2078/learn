By the end of this unit, you should be comfortable selecting and dropping specific columns from a DataFrame.

It might seem strange to discuss splitting a DataFrame in a course section on joining them, but we'll do so here to create the DataFrames that we'll join later on. We take this approach for two reasons:

- Creating our own DataFrames gives us easy control over the content of the child DataFrames to best demonstrate aspects of joining datasets.
- Because we have a baseline, a joined DataFrame (`df`), it's easy to see how different methods of joining the child DataFrames produce different results.

We're going to create two child DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`. `df1` will contain the first 35 columns of our data, and `df2` will contain the rest. This structure will allow us to explore how we can manipulate and manage columns in a dataset. It will also allow us to simulate a common scenario where some of the data that you need is in one location, while the rest is in a different location.

```python
df1 = df.iloc[:,:35]
```

### Try it yourself

- Why did we use syntax `df1 = df.iloc[:,:35]` to capture the first 35 columns of `df`?
- What does the first `:` (colon) in the square brackets do?

Experiment with `df3 = df.iloc[:35]` in a code cell and compare `df3.info()` with `df1.info()` to see why we need to use this syntax.

  Try:

  ```python
  df3 = df.iloc[:35]
  ```

  Then check:

  ```python
  df3.info()
  ```

  Now look at:

  ```python
  df1.info()
  ```

  The output is:

## Let's create df2

We'll create `df2` in a similar manner to `df1`. But we need to do things a little differently here to ensure that the first column (`NDB_No`) makes it into `df2`. This is going to serve as the column that's common to both child DataFrames when we join them later in this section.

We also want to populate `df2` with a different number of rows than `df1`, again simulating real-world scenarios. Doing so will make it easier to demonstrate what goes on with some of the join techniques shown later.

```python
df2 = df.iloc[0:2000, [0]+[i for i in range(35,53)]]
```

> [!div class="alert is-tip"]
>
> ### Question
>
> If you're unsure about why we use `[0] + [i for i in range(35,53)]` in the preceding list comprehension, review the documentation for the `range()` function by using `range?` in a code cell. You might want to run `[0] + [i for i in range(35,53)]` in the cell as part of your exploration, and experiment with adding (or concatenating) arrays. And remember that Python uses zero-based indexing.

We can examine `df2` by using the `head()` and `info()` methods.

```python
df2.head()
```

The output is:

Now use `info()`.

```python
df2.info()
```

The output is:

You'll notice on that both DataFrames have their old indexes that they inherited from `df`. We can fix that by using the `reset_index()` method, but then we run into a problem.

```python
df1 = df1.reset_index()
df1.head()
```

Our old indexes are still there for `df1`, but now they're in a new column titled `index`. Pandas doesn't want to delete data that we might need. We can instruct pandas to remove the column, which we know is unnecessary, by using the `drop=True` parameter for the method. (We also need to drop the `index` column that we created in the prior step.)

```python
df1 = df1.drop(['index'], axis=1) #remove the index we created previously
df1 = df1.reset_index(drop=True) #reset the index and tell pandas not to create the copy
df1.head()
```

For practice, let's export these DataFrames to CSV files by using the `to_csv()` method. Note that unless we explicitly tell pandas not to, it will also export the index as a column in the CSV file. We'll also need to be careful to explicitly encode our CSV to UTF-8.

```python
df1.to_csv('Data/NNDB1.csv', sep=',', encoding='utf-8',index=False)
```

### Try it yourself

How would you export df2 to a CSV file?

> ### Takeaway
>
> Although it's not common in the real world to split DataFrames only to merge them again later, you'll need to drop columns or create new DataFrames that contain only the information you need. With truly large datasets, this is not just a convenience for your analysis. It's a necessity for memory and performance!
