The Ethereum protocol includes multiple independent networks. Networks are Ethereum environments you can access for development, testing, or production use cases. 

You'll need to understand the networks that Ethereum provides, how they differ from one another, and how to connect and deploy to networks. For whatever blockchain solution you create, you need to choose a private or public solution and how to go from development to test to production network.

The goal of this module is to familiarize you with the network options in the Ethereum protocol. You'll explore some tools you can use to interact with the network options. And you'll learn how to work with different networks.

## Learning objectives

 By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify the public and private networks available in Ethereum.
- Explain the requirements to prepare a solution for the mainnet.
- Know how to use MetaMask with Infura to connect a blockchain solution to networks.
