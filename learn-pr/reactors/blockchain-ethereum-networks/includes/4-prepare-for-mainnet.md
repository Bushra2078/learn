Before you deploy to the Ethereum mainnet, you need to fully test and audit your code. Working in the mainnet requires real ether, which costs real money and can add up quickly!

After you develop, test, and audit your code, run the project on at least one testnet and resolve any problems. Most projects follow a substantial process before they're deployed to the mainnet. The process includes auditing, testing, security, and governance. It minimizes the risks and costs of things going wrong in the mainnet.

The process for preparing for mainnet and deploying to mainnet requires a series of steps. These are the basic steps for deploying to the Ethereum mainnet: 

1. Audit the smart contracts.
1. Verify source code.
1. Manage keys.
1. Handle project governance. 
 
The following sections describe these steps in detail.

## Perform a smart contract audit

[Auditing and assessing](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/preparing-for-mainnet#auditing-and-security?azure-portal=true) the security of smart contracts is imperative before you deploy to a public network. Once a smart contract is deployed, anyone on the network can send a transaction directly to the contracts with any payload. All of the code and the state of the contract is publicly available. Since transactions on blockchains are immutable, once committed, the transactions are permanent and can result in funds being stolen and other malicious activity. It's imperative to audit smart contracts before deployment.

## Verify source code

Before deploying to mainnet, the smart contract [source code should be verified](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/preparing-for-mainnet#verify-source-code?azure-portal=true) by submitting the Solidity code to a third party. Public services such as [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract?azure-portal=true) will compile it and verify that it matches the deployed assembly. That way, any user can view your contract code in a block explorer, and know that it corresponds to the assembly actually running at that address.

Steps for Verifying and Publishing your Solidity Source Code:

- Enter Contract Source Code.
- If the Bytecode generated matches the existing Creation Address Bytecode, the contract is then verified.
- Contract Source Code is published and publicly verifiable by anyone.

## Manage keys securely

Itâ€™s imperative to [securely manage private keys](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/preparing-for-mainnet#key-management?azure-portal=true) when deploying to the mainnet. Securing private keys and managing them so they can't be compromised, lost, or stolen requires heavy precautions. There have been several major thefts and losses because of keys being mismanaged, lost, or stolen. The accounts used to deploy and interact with smart contracts hold real Ether and are targets for hackers. [Hardware wallets](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/wallets/hardware/?azure-portal=true) and [cold storage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cold-storage.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways&text=Cold%20storage%20is%20a%20way,their%20holdings%20via%20traditional%20means?azure-portal=true.) (computers never connected to any network) are common ways to store private keys securely.

## Handle project governance

There are different ways that decentralized [projects are managed](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/preparing-for-mainnet#project-governance?azure-portal=true) depending on community and user base. Often organizations are created to determine how updates, and other aspects of the running decentralized system are managed. There are several options of how project governance can be managed, from a small group of trusted administrators, to public voting of all project stakeholders. There's no right answer here. It comes down to what solution you're building and who your community and users are.
