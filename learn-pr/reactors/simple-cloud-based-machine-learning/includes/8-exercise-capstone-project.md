In this Capstone project, you'll engage with flight delay data, which can be found at `Data/flightdata.csv` in the accompanying Notebook.

## Tasks

Use what you know about Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Machine Learning to accomplish the following tasks:

- Identify requirements for success.
- Identify possible risks in the data, if this were a real-world scenario.
- Prepare the data.
- Select features (variables).
- Split the data between training and testing.
- Choose algorithms.

## Options

If you prefer to find your own dataset, that's ok. You should limit your searching to about 15 minutes. Microsoft has several Public Datasets if you want to start there.

You're also encouraged to explore any aspects of the data. Be explicit about your inquiry and success in predicting affects on our world.
