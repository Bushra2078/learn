To use Azure Machine Learning, you need an active Azure subscription and a Machine Learning resource. These steps walk you through the process.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) in a new browser tab, and sign in with a Microsoft account. Search for the Machine Learning resource, and create a new one. Use the Enterprise workspace edition.

1. After the Machine Learning resource is created, go to the resource and select **Launch Now** in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

1. From the home page, go to **Datasets**. Locate the bank-full.csv file in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank%2BMarketing?azure-portal=true). Select **From local files**, and upload the file to Azure Machine Learning Studio.

## Explore bank-marketing data

Let's take a look at the data we uploaded to Azure Machine Learning. The data is essentially a set of calls made to customers of a particular bank.<sup>[1][^1]</sup> The goal of the calls was to upsell customers on a product or service. This dataset contains a row for each call with the demographic information of the customer in all columns, except for the final column **y**. The final column indicates whether a customer upgraded to the additional services or products.
