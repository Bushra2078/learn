So far, we've explored how to access and modify portions of arrays by using simple indices like `arr[0]` and slices like `arr[:5]`. Now it's time for fancy indexing, in which we pass an array of indices to an array in order to access or modify multiple array elements at the same time.

Let's try it out:

```python
rand = np.random.RandomState(42)

arr = rand.randint(100, size=10)
print(arr)
```

The output is:

```Output
[51 92 14 71 60 20 82 86 74 74]
```

Suppose you need to access three different elements. Using the tools you currently have, your code might look something like this code:

```python
[arr[3], arr[7], arr[2]]
```

The output is:

```Output
[71, 86, 14]
```

With fancy indexing, you can pass a single list or array of indices to do the same thing:

```python
ind = [3, 7, 4]
arr[ind]
```

The output is:

```Output
array([71, 86, 60])
```

Another useful aspect of fancy indexing is that the shape of the output array reflects the shape of the *index arrays* you supply, rather than the shape of the array you're accessing. This is handy because, as a data scientist, you'll frequently want to grab data from an array in a particular way, such as to pass it to a machine learning API. Let's examine this property with an example:

```python
ind = np.array([[3, 7],
                [4, 5]])
arr[ind]
```

The output is:

```Output
array([[71, 86],
       [60, 20]])
```

`arr` is a one-dimensional array, but `ind`, your index array, is a 2 x 2 array, so the results come back in that shape.

#### Try it yourself

What happens when your index array is bigger than the target array?

  ```python
  ind = np.arange(0, 12).reshape((6, 2))
  arr(ind)
  ```
  
  The output is:

  ```Output
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
   in 
      2 # Hint: you could use a large one-dimensional array or something fancier like ind = np.arange(0, 12).  reshape((6, 2))
        3 ind = np.arange(0, 12).reshape((6, 2))
  ----> 4 arr(ind)
  
  TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object is not callable
  ```
  
</details>

***

Fancy indexing also works in multiple dimensions:

```python
arr2 = np.arange(12).reshape((3, 4))
arr2
```

The output is:

```Output
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
```

As with standard indexing, the first index refers to the row and the second to the column:

```python
row = np.array([0, 1, 2])
col = np.array([2, 1, 3])
arr2[row, col]
```

The output is:

```Output
array([ 2,  5, 11])
```

What did you get as your final result here? The first value in the result array is `arr2[0, 2]`, the second one is `arr2[1, 1]`, and the third one is `arr2[2, 3]`.

The pairing of indices in fancy indexing follows all the same broadcasting rules we covered earlier. So if you combine a column vector and a row vector within the indices, you get a two-dimensional result:

```python
arr2[row[:, np.newaxis], col]
```

The output is:

```Output
array([[ 2,  1,  3],
       [ 6,  5,  7],
       [10,  9, 11]])
```

Here, each row value is matched with each column vector, exactly as we saw in the broadcasting of arithmetic operations.

### Try it yourself

Now try broadcasting this on your own.

- What do you get with `row[:, np.newaxis] * col`?
- Or `row[:, np.newaxis] * row`?
- What about `col[:, np.newaxis] * row`?

Think back to the broadcast rules.

  Try:

  ```python
  row[:, np.newaxis] * col
  ```
  
  The output is:

  ```Output
  array([[0, 0, 0],
       [2, 1, 3],
       [4, 2, 6]])
  ```

  For:

  ```python
  row[:, np.newaxis] * row
  ```
  
  The output is:

  ```Output
  array([[0, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 2],
       [0, 2, 4]])
  ```

  And for:

  ```python
  col[:, np.newaxis] * row
  ```
  
  The output is:

  ```Output
  array([[0, 2, 4],
       [0, 1, 2],
       [0, 3, 6]])
  ```

> It's always important to remember that fancy indexing returns values reflected by the *broadcasted shape of the indices* and not the shape of the array being indexed.

## Combined indexing

You can also combine fancy indexing with the other indexing schemes you've learned. Consider `arr2` again:

```python
print(arr2)
```

The output is:

```Output
[[ 0  1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6  7]
 [ 8  9 10 11]]
```

Now combine fancy and simple indices:

```python
arr2[2, [2, 0, 1]]
```

The output is:

```Output
array([10,  8,  9])
```

What did you get back? The elements at positions 2, 0, and 1 of row 2 (the third row).

You can also combine fancy indexing with slicing:

```python
arr2[1:, [2, 0, 1]]
```

The output is:

```Output
array([[ 6,  4,  5],
       [10,  8,  9]])
```

Again, consider what you got back as output: the elements at positions 2, 0, and 1 of each row after the first one (so the second and third rows).

Of course, you can also combine fancy indexing with masking:

```python
mask = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0], dtype=bool)
arr2[row[:, np.newaxis], mask]
```

The output is:

```Output
array([[ 0,  2],
       [ 4,  6],
       [ 8, 10]])
```

## Modifying values by using fancy indexing

Fancy indexing is, of course, not just for accessing parts of an array. It's also for modifying parts of an array:

```python
ind = np.arange(10)
arr = np.array([2, 1, 8, 4])
ind[arr] = 99
print(ind)
```

The output is:

```Output
[ 0 99 99  3 99  5  6  7 99  9]
```

You can also use a ufunc here and subtract 10 from each element of the array:

```python
ind[arr] -= 10
print(ind)
```

The output is:

```Output
[ 0 89 89  3 89  5  6  7 89  9]
```

Be cautious when you use repeated indices with operations like these. They might not always produce the results you expect. For example:

```python
ind = np.zeros(10)
ind[[0, 0]] = [4, 6]
print(ind)
```

The output is:

```Output
[6. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
```

Where did the 4 go? The result of this operation is to first assign `ind[0] = 4`, followed by `ind[0] = 6`. So the result is that `ind[0]` contains the value 6.

But not every operation repeats the way you might think it should:

```python
arr = [2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]
ind[arr] += 1
ind
```

The output is:

```Output
array([6., 0., 1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])
```

We might have expected that `ind[3]` would contain the value 2 and `ind[4]` would contain the value 3. After all, that's how many times each index is repeated. So what happened?

This output occurred because `ind[arr] += 1` is really shorthand for `ind[arr] = ind[arr] + 1`. `ind[arr] + 1` is evaluated, and then the result is assigned to the indices in `ind`. So, similar to the previous example, this isn't augmentation that happens multiple times. It's an assignment, which can lead to potentially counterintuitive results.

But what if you want an operation to repeat? To do this, use the `at()` method of ufuncs:

```python
ind = np.zeros(10)
np.add.at(ind, arr, 1)
print(ind)
```

The output is:

```Output
[0. 0. 1. 2. 3. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
```

#### Try it yourself

What does `np.subtract.at(ind, arr, 1)` give you?
