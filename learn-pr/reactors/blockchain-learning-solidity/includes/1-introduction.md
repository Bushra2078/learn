The first major use case for blockchain technology has been centered around cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. But what about when you want to use blockchain to transfer a digital asset other than currency? Suppose you use a supply chain, which handles the transportation and delivery of goods. Or you have an online marketplace and want to use blockchain technology to help facilitate the buying, selling, and transferring of products.

In these examples, you can use a programming language called [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/?azure-portal=true) to code the operation of your supply chain, online marketplace, or other use cases. By using Solidity, you can also specify user actions. By programming these actions allowed on the network, you are able to create your own blockchain networks that are secure and transparent for all participants involved.

In this module, you'll explore the fundamentals of the Solidity language and learn how to program smart contracts along the way.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain what Solidity is, and how the features of the language work
- Understand the components of a smart contract
- Create a basic smart contract with Solidity

## Prerequisites

- Understand blockchain fundamentals
