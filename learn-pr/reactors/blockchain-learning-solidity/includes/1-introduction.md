The first major use case for blockchain technology has been centered around cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. But what about when you want to use blockchain to transfer a digital asset other than currency? Suppose you use a supply chain which handles the transportation and delivery of goods. Or you have an online marketplace and want to use blockchain technology to help facilitate the buying, selling, and transferring of products.

In that case, you can use a programming language called [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) to code how your supply chain, online marketplace, or other use case operates, and what actions participants can take. By programming these actions allowed on the network, you can create your own blockchain networks that are secure and transparent for all participants involved.

In this module, you'll explore the fundamentals of the Solidity language and learn how to program smart contracts along the way.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain what Solidity is, and how the features of the language work
- Understand the components of a smart contract
- Create a basic smart contract with Solidity

## Prerequisites

- Understand blockchain fundamentals
- Knowledge of the Ethereum platform
- Previous experience with any programming language like C, Python, or JavaScript
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts
