In contrast to *k*-means clustering, naive Bayes is a supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm. It provides good speed and good accuracy and is often used in aspects of natural-language processing such text classification or, in our case in this module, spam detection.

Spam emails are more than just a nuisance. As recently as 2008, spam constituted an apocalyptic 97.8 percent of all email traffic according to a [2009 Microsoft security report](https://download.microsoft.com/download/4/3/8/438BE24D-4D58-4D9A-900A-A1FC58220813/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report%20_volume8_July-Dec2009_English.pdf?azure-portal=true). That tide has thankfully turned and, as of May 2019, spam makes up only about [85 percent of email traffic](https://www.talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep?azure-portal=true)â€”thanks in no small part to naive Bayes spam filters.

Naive Bayes is a convenient algorithm for spam detection because it doesn't require encoding complex rules. All it needs is training examples, of which there are plenty when it comes to email spam. Naive Bayes does all this through the use of [conditional probability](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability?azure-portal=true).
