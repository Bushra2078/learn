To learn most effectively throughout this learn module, set up your environment so that you can follow along.

Finish these steps to set up your environment:

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true). It's free and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Select the stable build for your platform.
1. Download and install the [Python extension for Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python?azure-portal=true). First, you'll install a supported version of Python.
1. Activate the [Anaconda environment in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support?azure-portal=true) to run Jupyter notebooks.
1. Set up a [Data Science environment in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial?azure-portal=true) to use NumPy and Pandas.

### Test your environment

If you've successfully set up your environment with Visual Studio Code, Python, Anaconda, and the NumPy and Pandas libraries, you should be able to run a Jupyter notebook in Visual Studio Code.

1. Clone the [Reactor repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Reactors?azure-portal=true), and open the folder that corresponds to this module in Visual Studio Code.
1. Run the [`Test-Setup-Config.ipynb`](https://github.com/microsoft/Reactors/tree/master/Learn/Intro-python-data-science/Test-Setup-Config.ipynb?azure-portal=true) file to ensure you're ready to continue through the module.

### Work through this learn module

As you work through this module, you'll be encouraged to try out code. Use the files you cloned to do this.

Jupyter notebooks are divided into cells. Each cell contains either text written in the Markdown markup language or a space in which to write and execute computer code. Because all the code resides inside code cells, you can run each code cell inline instead of using a separate Python interactive window.

> [!NOTE]
> This learn module is designed to have you run code cells one by one. As you complete these modules, you're encouraged to copy the code snippets into your Visual Studio Code Jupyter Notebook instance and run each cell one at a time.

> Several units in this module include a Hint feature that you can select to reveal the answer to a practice question. This feature works best in Google Chrome and the latest Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browsers. In other browsers, the answer might not be hidden.
