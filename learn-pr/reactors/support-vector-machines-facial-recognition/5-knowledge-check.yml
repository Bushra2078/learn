      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, SVM doesn't refer to Simple Vectorized Model."
    - content: "Simultaneous Vector Manipulation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, SVM doesn't refer to Simultaneous Vector Manipulation."
    - content: "Simulated Volumetric Model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, SVM doesn't refer to	Simulated Volumetric Model."
    - content: "Support Vector Machine"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In machine learning, SVM is an abbreviation for Support Vector Machine."
  - content: "What is the purpose of cross-validation in machine learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "Get a more accurate estimate of a model’s accuracy."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cross-validation helps you determine how accurate your model is."
    - content: "Prevent a model from overfitting the training data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, cross-validation doesn't refer to fitting or overfitting training data."
    - content: "Prevent a model from underfitting the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, cross-validation doesn't refer to fitting or underfitting training data."
    - content: "Reduce the time required to test a model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, cross-validation isn't used to help reduce time spent testing a model."
  - content: "What is the purpose of hyperparameter tuning?"
    choices:
    - content: "Find the learning algorithm that produces the most accurate model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, tuning hyperparameters doesn't focus on finding an algorithm that would produce the most accurate model."
    - content: "Eliminate collinearity in a dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, tuning hyperparameters doesn't address collinearity in a dataset."
    - content: "Find the combination of parameters that produces the most accurate model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In machine learning, tuning hyperparameters helps you find the combination of parameters that produces the most accurate model."
    - content: "Reduce training time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tuning hyperparameters doesn't address how long it takes to train a dataset."
  - content: "For which of the following tasks might you use Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Normalize the values in a column or a set of columns."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Reduce the number of columns in a dataset from 100 to 10."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Find a linear classification boundary by adding dimensions to the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.."
    - content: "Find a linear classification boundary by removing dimensions from the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: "In an SVM model, what do the ‘c’ and ‘gamma’ parameters control?"
    choices:
    - content: "The tightness of fit to the training data."
      isCorrect: true
