    choices:
    - content: "Simple Vectorized Model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, SVM is not an abbreviation for Simple Vectorized Model."
    - content: "Simultaneous Vector Manipulation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, SVM is not an abbreviation for Simultaneous Vector Manipulation."
    - content: "Simulated Volumetric Model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, SVM is not an abbreviation for Simulated Volumetric Model."
    - content: "Support Vector Machine"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In machine learning, SVM is an abbreviation for Support Vector Machine."
  - content: "What is the purpose of cross-validation in machine learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "Get a more accurate estimate of a modelâ€™s accuracy."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cross-validation helps you determine how accurate your model is."
    - content: "Prevent a model from overfitting the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, cross-validation does not refer to fitting or overfitting training data."
    - content: "Prevent a model from underfitting the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, cross-validation does not refer to fitting or underfitting training data."
    - content: "Reduce the time required to test a model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, cross-validation is not used to help reduce time spent testing a model."
  - content: "What is the purpose of hyperparameter tuning?"
    choices:
    - content: "To find the learning algorithm that produces the most accurate model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, tuning hyperparameters does not focus on finding an algorithm that would produce the most accurate model."
    - content: "To eliminate collinearity in a dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In machine learning, tuning hyperparameters does not address collinearity in a dataset."
    - content: "To fnd the combination of parameters that produces the most accurate model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In machine learning, tuning hyperparameters helps you find the combination of parameters that produces the most accurate model."
    - content: "To reduce training time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tuning hyperparameters is not related to how long it takes to train a dataset. Tuning hyperparameters and cross-validation might take more time, but you might end up with more accurate data."
  - content: "For which of the following tasks might you use principal component analysis (PCA)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Normalize the values in a column or a set of columns."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PCA is not used to normalize the values in a column or set of columns."
    - content: "Reduce the number of columns in a dataset from 100 to 10."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You would use PCA in a task that reduces the number of columns in a dataset from 100 to 10."
    - content: "Find a linear classification boundary by adding dimensions to the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PCA is not used to fFind a linear classification boundary by adding dimensions to the data."
    - content: "Find a linear classification boundary by removing dimensions from the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PCA is not used to find a linear classification boundary by removing dimensions from the data."
  - content: "In an SVM model, what do the <code>C</code> and <code>gamma</code> parameters control?"
    choices:
    - content: "The tightness of fit to the training data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In an SVM model, the <code>C</code> and <code>gamma</code> parameters control how tight the fit of the training data is."
    - content: "The number of dimensions added to the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The <code>C</code> and <code>gamma</code> parameters do not control the number of dimensions added to the data."
    - content: "The tolerance for nulls in the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The <code>C</code> and <code>gamma</code> parameters do not control the tolerance for nulls in the training data."
    - content: "The veracity of the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The <code>C</code> and <code>gamma</code> parameters are not used to verify the veracity of the training data."
