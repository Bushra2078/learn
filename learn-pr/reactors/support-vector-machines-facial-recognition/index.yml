title: Support vector machines and facial recognition
summary: Learn how to use SVM models to better support complex data and questions. Use scikit-learn and PCA to optimize analysis in a facial recognition example.
abstract:  | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Train an support vector model (SVM) model to do image classification by using items in a dataset. 
  - Use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of dimensions in a dataset to help increase the accuracy of a model.
  - Use <code>GridSearchCV</code> with scikit-learn to tune hyperparameters and increase the accuracy of your model.
  - Learn how to cross-validate a model, and quantify its accuracy.
