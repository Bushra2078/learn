[Support Vector Machines (SVMs)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine?azure-portal=true) often can do better than other models at fitting dataâ€”especially data is that is highly nonlinear. SVM models use kernels to draw complex boundaries around sets of like data points. The diagram on the left in the following illustration shows a 2-D set of data points that a linear model won't fit. In other words, there is no line you can draw to separate the blue points from the green points. However, SVM can use a "kernel trick" to add a third dimension to each data point based on its distance from the center. In 3-D space (below right), you can then draw a plane that cleanly separates the two classes of data points.

That's a simple way to visualize how SVMs work. Let's learn about SVMs by using the [Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/?azure-portal=true) dataset that is provided with scikit-learn to build a facial recognition model.
