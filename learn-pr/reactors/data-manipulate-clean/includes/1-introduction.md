Up until now, we have been introducing ideas and techniques in order to prepare you with a toolbox of techniques to deal with real-world situations. Now we are now going to start using some of those tools, while also giving you some ideas about how and when to use them in your own work with data.

Real-world data is messy. You will likely need to combine several data sources to get the data you actually want. The data from those sources will be incomplete. And it will likely not be formatted in exactly the way you want in order to perform your analysis. It's for these reasons that most data scientists will tell you that about 80 percent of any project is spent just getting the data into a form ready for analysis.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to find general information about the data that's stored in pandas DataFrames.
- Get a general knowledge of the various ways to combine DataFrames.
- Learn how to identify and remove duplicate values from DataFrames.
- Learn how to replace or remove null values in a DataFrame.
- Learn ways to visually explore the data that's stored in a pandas DataFrame.

## Prerequisites

  - [Environment setup](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/blob/new-data-science-1/learn-pr/reactors/python-data-science/includes/1-introduction.md#set-up-your-environment)
  - [Introduction to Python for data science](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/blob/new-data-science-1/learn-pr/reactors/python-data-science/index.yml)
  - [Introduction to NumPy for data science](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/blob/new-data-science-1/learn-pr/reactors/numpy-data-science/index.yml)
  - [Introduction to pandas for data science](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/blob/new-data-science-1/learn-pr/reactors/pandas-data-science/index.yml)

Working with data starts with a knowledge of data structures. Let's see what Python has to offer.
