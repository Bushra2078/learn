Up until now, we have been introducing ideas and techniques to deal with real-world situations. Now you're going to start using some of those tools, and understanding how and when to use them in your own work with data.

Real-world data is messy. You'll likely need to combine several data sources to get the data you actually want. The data from those sources will be incomplete. And, the data likely won't be formatted exactly the way you want it for your analysis. For these reasons, most data scientists will tell you that about 80 percent of any project is spent just getting the data into a form that is ready to use for analysis.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to find general information about the data that's stored in pandas `DataFrames`.
- Get a general knowledge of the various ways to combine `DataFrames`.
- Learn how to identify and remove duplicate values from `DataFrames`.
- Learn how to replace or remove null values in a `DataFrame`.
- Learn ways to visually explore the data that's stored in a pandas `DataFrame`.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code environment set up to run Python and Jupyter notebooks](../../python-data-science/1-introduction.yml)
- [Introduction to Python for data science](../../python-data-science/index.yml)
- [Introduction to NumPy for data science](../../numpy-data-science/index.yml)
- [Introduction to pandas for data science](../../pandas-data-science/index.yml)

[!INCLUDE [Set up your environment](../../includes/set-up-environment.md)]

Working with data begins with a knowledge of data structures. Let's see what Python has to offer.
