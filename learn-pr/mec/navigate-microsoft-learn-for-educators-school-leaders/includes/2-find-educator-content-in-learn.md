In this unit, you will learn about what content Learn offers for educators, how to find this educator content in Learn, and how to share it with your colleagues or students.

Offerings in Learn for educators will include:

- Educator professional development training and courses
- Educator skilling on Microsoft products
- Educator teaching materials (coming soon to Learn)
- Programs for institutions, educators and students (coming soon to Learn)
- Technical skilling courses for students

As the Microsoft Educator center merges with Microsoft Learn it will become the single training hub to empower digital classrooms.

## Modules and learning paths

Most of our training content is in the form of *modules* which are organized into a series of *learning paths*. Modules are shorter courses, typically 30-60 minutes, that consist of pages called units. Learning paths are a series of modules centered around mastery of a particular topic. If you came from MEC, a module is the equivalent of a course and a learning path is the equivalent of a learning path.

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that will be solved by the content in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "In the shoe-company scenario, we will use a Twitter trigger to launch our app when tweets containing our product name are available."

## Browse and search for educator content

On Learn, we have thousands of modules and learning paths to help you get started with any Microsoft products. You can filter for educator-specific content by selecting your role as either a "K-12 Educator", "Higher-ed Educator", "School Leader" or "Parent & Guardian", under the “Role” filter. You can also filter by products as well as search for keywords.

To browse content go to the Learn "browse all" page at [docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/)

To use the filters, select on of the boxes under product, role, level, or type, in order to see the list of content pertaining to that category.

- *Product* is where you can find educational tools such as Microsoft Teams, Immersive Reader, Reading Progress, OneNote, Minecraft, Flipgrid, Windows, Powerpoint, Forms, Edge, OneDrive, Sway, and many more.
- *Role* is where you can select the category that fits you best as either a *K-12 Educator, Higher-ed Educator, School Leader*, or *Parent & Guardian*.
- *Level* is where you can select from the appropriate experience level with the content as either a *beginner*, *intermediate* or *advanced*.
- *Type* is where you can select from either Modules or Learning Paths.

> [!CAUTION]
> The search bar displayed in the top right of the page header will search all of Docs.microsoft.com which includes more than just Learn. It includes Documentation, Certifications, Q&A, Code Samples and more. To search just Learn modules and learning paths, make sure to use the correct search bar on the "Browse all" page detailed above.

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what's covered in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will learn the policy factors that are controlled by a storage account so you can decide how many accounts you need."

TODO: write your prose table-of-contents -->

<!-- 4. Visual element (highly recommended) ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Visual element, like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote. Ideally, you'll provide an image that illustrates the customer problem the unit will solve; it can use the scenario to do this or stay generic (i.e. not address the scenario).

    Heading: none

TODO: add a visual element -->

<!-- 5. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to perform this sub-task.

    Structure: Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. 1-3 paragraphs of text
        3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote.
