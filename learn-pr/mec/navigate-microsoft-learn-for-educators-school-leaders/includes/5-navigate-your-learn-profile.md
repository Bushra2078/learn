## Badges, trophies and reputation points
 
Badges and trophies are achievements that you receive after completing training content. You will get a badge after completing a module and a trophy after completing all the modules in a learning path. You can also earn XP points and increase in level as you continue to progress through content. 
Caution: Reputation points are points received for participation on Q&A, Microsoft’s technical question and answer platform, unless you are a technical educator, this may not be very relevant to you at this time.

## Collections and favorites

If you find a module or learning path interesting but don’t want to start it at the moment, you can save it to a collection. You have a default collection called “favorites”, and you can also create new collections as you need. You can even share the collections that you have created with others. All your collections can be found in your profile.
Note: We will be publishing Microsoft official curated collections for educator skills like remote teaching and inclusive classroom by September. Stay tuned!
