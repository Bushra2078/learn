As schools around the world respond to COVID-19 and increase their use of technology in the classroom, the need for confidence using these technologies has never been more urgent. As an educator, you want to train yourself on the latest educational tools like Microsoft Teams in order to help support your teaching and ensure the best learning outcomes for your students. Microsoft provides an excellent, free, platform to help you train to use the classroom tools called Microsoft Learn.

## What is Microsoft Learn?

Microsoft Learn is a place where professional development training, curriculum, hands-on experiences, and certifications come together to support technical professionals as well as educators, students, and institutions.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Educator Center is merging with Microsoft Learn. On Microsoft Learn, youâ€™ll have access to the same awesome professional development content that you love from the Microsoft Educator Center, with even more features to help you on your learning journey. We'll also bring your learning history and achievements to Microsoft Learn, so you can pick up your learning journey right where you last left off!

<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts

    Heading: "## Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company on the marketing team. You're launching a new basketball shoe created by a celebrity athlete. Previous launches resulted in a social media frenzy as people shared stories and photos of themselves wearing their new shoes. The marketing team wants to monitor hundreds of social media sites, blogs, and websites to determine consumer reaction. There will be more data than you can process manually. You would like a cloud-hosted system that automates monitoring, text analytics, database storage, and email notifications."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario, use the image markdown extension (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/markdown-reference?branch=master#images)

    Optional: a "scenario video" that visualizes the scenario

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Here, you'll create a business workflow using Azure Logic Apps to automate the processing of tweets:
                * **Launch**: when a new tweet is available
                * **Process**: determine if the sentiment of the tweet is positive or negative
                * **Route**: branch based on the sentiment score"

 -->
## How do I get started?

In this *module* (the name for short courses on Microsoft Learn) you'll Learn how to navigate Microsoft Learn in order to find professional development training content on tools like Microsoft Teams. You will also learn the basics of using Microsoft Learn, such as, how to set up your profile, how to find and share your achievements and how to create collections of training content that you can share with others.

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: This is a restatement of the module title into a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to create workflows which route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its built-in connectors."

 -->

<!-- ## What is the main goal?
By the end of this session, you'll be able to (TODO)
 Do **not** include any other content like learning objectives, prerequisites, unit summary, "next unit" lead-in, or references. -->
