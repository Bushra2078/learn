<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: remind the learner of the core idea(s) from the preceding learning-content unit (without mentioning the details of the exercise or the scenario)

    Heading: none

    Example: "A storage account represents a collection of settings that implement a business policy."

    [Exercise introduction guidance](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-introductions?branch=master#rule-use-the-standard-exercise-unit-introduction-format)
-->
Collections allow you to easily curate and organize sets of content and share them with anyone.

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario covered in this exercise

    Heading: a separate heading is optional; you can combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Recall that in the chocolate-manufacturer example, there would be a separate storage account for the private business data. There were two key requirements for this account: geographically-redundant storage because the data is business-critical and at least one location close to the main factory."

    Recommended: image that summarizes the entire scenario with a highlight of the area implemented in this exercise
-->
Recall that you can find content about a particular product, topic or for a particular role by using the Learn "Browse all" page.

<!-- 3. Task performed in the exercise ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what they'll implement here; that is, describe the end-state after completion

    Heading: a separate heading is optional; you can combine this with the sub-task into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will create a storage account with settings appropriate to hold this mission-critical business data."

    Optional: a video that shows the end-state
-->
In this exercise, you will create a collection of professional development content centered around Collaboration that you can share with your peers.

<!-- 4. Chunked steps -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the steps they'll do to complete the exercise.

    Structure: Break the steps into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. A heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. An introductory paragraph describing the goal of the chunk at a high level
        3. Numbered steps (target 7 steps or fewer in each chunk)

    Example:
        Heading:
            "Use a template for your Azure logic app"
        Introduction:
             "When you create an Azure logic app in the Azure portal, you have the option of selecting a starter template. Let's select a blank template so that we can build our logic app from scratch."
        Steps:
             "1. In the left navigation bar, select Resource groups.
              2. Select the existing Resource group [sandbox resource group name].
              3. Select the ShoeTracker logic app.
              4. Scroll down to the Templates section and select Blank Logic App."

## Step 1: Find your first learning path and create your collection

Our goal is to find some training content centered around fostering collaboration in the classroom that we can share with our colleagues. In order to do this, we will first find a Learning Path that meets our criteria and then create a collection for it, where we can add more modules and learning paths that we find.

1. To start, we will go to the Learn browse page at: `https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/`. Copy and paste this URL into a new tab in your browser window in order to go to this page.
1. Second, we will select some information that will help us to narrow down and find the specific Learning Path that we are looking for.
    1. In the "Types" category, select "Learning Path"
    1. In the "Role" category, select "K-12 Educator"
    1. In the "Product" category, select "Microsoft Teams"
    1. Lastly, type "Remote learning" into the search bar.
1. You should now see a learning path entitled "Fostering a dynamic remote learning environment with student-centered tools"
1. On the card that displays this learning path, click on the "Save" icon. 
1. A pop-up modal will appear, select "+ New collection" to create a new collection.
1. A new window will appear where you can enter a "Title" and "Description"
    1. For the "Title", enter "My Classroom Collaboration Training"
    1. For the "Description", you can either enter a description of your choosing or leave this blank.
1. Click "Submit" and "Save". You should now have a new collection saved. You can find this collection by going to the "Collections" area of your profile.

## Step 2: Add another module to add to your collection
We will now find a second piece of content that we can add to our collection. This time we will select a module.
1. Return to the Learn browse page at: https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/
1. Enter some filters and search parameters that will help us to find this module. 
    1. In the "Types" category, select "Learning Path"
    2. In the "Roles" category, select "K-12 Educator"
    3. In the "Product" category, select "OneNote"
    4. Lastly, type "Class Notebook" into the search bar.
1. You should now see a module entitled "OneNote Class Notebook: A teacher's all-in-one notebook for students"
1. On the card that displays this module, click on the "Save" icon.
1. A pop-up modal will appear again, this time select the collection that you created "My Classroom Collaboration Training" and then press "Save".
1. Great job! This module has now been saved to your collection.

## Step 3: Share your collection
Now that we have a collection with some interesting learning paths and modules in it. We can share it with our colleagues.

1. First, go to the "Collections" area of your profile by selecting the avatar image in the top right-hand corner of the Learn screen and then selecting "Collections" from the dropdown menu.
1. You should now see all of the collections that are saved to your profile. Select the collection "My Classroom Collaboration Training" to navigate to its dedicated page.
1. You should now see the page that displays your "My Classroom Collaboration Training" collection along with the module and learning path that we added to it in the previous steps.
1. To share the collection, you can copy and paste the URL. You can also share via email, LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter, by selecting the "Share" icon and choosing from the dropdown list of items.
1. Find a method that suits your choosing and send the collection to one of your friends/colleagues.
1. Great job! You have now learned how to create collections and share them on Learn.

<!-- 5. Validation chunk -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Helps the learner to evaluate if they completed the exercise correctly.

    Structure: Break the steps into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. A heading of "## Check your work"
        2. An introductory paragraph describing how they'll validate their work at a high level
        3. Numbered steps (when the learner needs to perform multiple steps to verify if they were successful)
        4. Video of an expert performing the exact steps of the exercise (optional)

    Example:
        Heading:
            "Examine the results of your Twitter trigger"
        Introduction:
             "At this point, our logic app is scanning Twitter every minute for tweets containing the search text. To verify the app is running and working correctly, we'll look at the Runs history table."
        Steps:
             "1. Select Overview in the navigation menu.
              2. Select Refresh once a minute until you see a row in the Runs history table.
              ...
              6. Examine the data in the OUTPUTS section. For example, locate the text of the matching tweet."
