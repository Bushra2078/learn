## Create and share collections of content

If you find a module or learning path interesting but don’t want to start it at the moment, you can create a collection to save it to. You have a default collection called “favorites”, and you can also create new collections as you need. You can also share your collections with your peers to learn together, or even your students to help them learn on their own. All your collections can be found in your profile under the 'collections' tab.
