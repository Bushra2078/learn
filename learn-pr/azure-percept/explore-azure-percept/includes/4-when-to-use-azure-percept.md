## Manufacturing

Manufacturing presents many challenges where you can use edge AI, for example, often decisions must be made near real-time in areas where data connectivity isn't always ideal.

Here are some use cases that Azure Percept can address in the manufacturing space:

- **Predictive maintenance**. Use data analysis tools and techniques to detect anomalies and possible equipment defects and process them so you can fix them before they result in failure.

- **Factory automation and defect detection**. Perform quality checks during and at the end of the production process to detect critical defects in products.

- **Field service**. Manage work tasks that are completed in any remote location.

## Energy

With the current energy supply chain crisis, there are many areas where Azure Percept can help with creating innovative solutions.

Here are some of the use cases that Azure Percept can address in the energy space:

- **Energy management**. Control and reduce energy consumption for greater efficiency.

- **Supply chain and operational efficiency**. The capability to make the most optimum use of resources (financial, human, technological or physical) to reduce operational costs and reduce time wastage.

- **Worker Safety**. The capability to detect dangerous zone (machinery, trench), and worker slip and fall.

## Smart cities/buildings

The smart cities domain brings together many security, energy, access, and transportation challenges. Energy management is a significant challenge in the smart city, which, if addressed, can also yield significant payoffs. Azure Percept can add value through the ability to deploy edge AI.

Here are some use cases that Azure Percept can address in the smart cities and buildings space:

- **Transportation and traffic management**. The control, direction, and supervision of all functions related to the procurement and use of transportation services.

- **Security and surveillance**. Continuous monitoring of specific individuals, groups, or areas.

- **Access control**. Determine who can access and use information and resources.

## Connected automotive

Azure Percept can add value by deploying edge AI in the connected automotive industry.

Here are some use cases that Azure Percept can address in the connected automotive space:

- **Factory automation**. Implementation of technology and systems to automate a manufacturing process with the ultimate goal of increasing productivity and reducing costs.

- **Passenger detection**. Detection of the presence of an unauthorized person in the passenger compartment or elsewhere in the vehicle.

- **Cabin intelligence**. Protection of drivers from fatigue and distraction while also identifying behaviors to recognize and reward.

## Retail

Modern retail spans core grocery store functions, discount stores, hypermarkets, supermarkets, department stores, specialty stores, and convenience stores. These retail formats operate based on a distinct supply chain management that brings a unique set of challenges.

Here are some use cases that Azure Percept can address in the retail space:

- **Consumer behavior**. Analyze consumer traffic and behavior patterns within retail and drive-through stores and offering personalized recommendations.

- **Shelf analytics**. Advanced product analytics through automated stockout analytics, product placement, planogram compliance, and end cap management.

- **Inventory management and shrinkage reduction**. Track goods lost from the recorded inventory list.

## Healthcare

With the current and potential future pandemics coupled with an aging population, healthcare offers many areas to deploy edge AI services through Azure Percept.

Here are some use cases that Azure Percept can address in the healthcare space:

- **Patient recognition and monitoring**. The capability to recognize, identify, and/or verify a patient from a digital image or video frame.

- **Waiting room prioritization**. The capability to prioritize assignment of waiting rooms based on the patient’s priority or severity.

- **Scheduling and reminders**. The ability to schedule appointments remotely and automatically send reminders.
