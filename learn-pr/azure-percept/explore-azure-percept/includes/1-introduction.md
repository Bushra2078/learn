As our customers and partners increasingly invest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) at the edge to transform their business operations, they deploy intelligent devices that will generate more data in the next three years than in the past 30 years combined. This means that transmitting and processing data in the public cloud will present new challenges for them, like limited bandwidth, latency, storage costs, and privacy issues.

While Edge AI powers digital transformation across every industry, when solution builders, operators, developers, customers, and partners develop and deploy Edge AI solutions, they find that some of the biggest barriers they face include complexities with scale, no end-to-end solution platforms, and security concerns.

To enable our customers to rapidly embrace digital transformation at the edge using familiar tools and experiences, Microsoft is investing in a comprehensive line-up that accelerates the journey to build Azure AI-ready devices, develop applications running on Azure, and leverage turnkey SaaS solutions. The fundamental piece to this transformational shift is the ability to perceive physical environments, and this is where Azure Percept comes in.

Azure Percept is a fully integrated platform that combines three primary components to simplify the creation and management of Edge AI solutions: Azure Percept Edge AI Device Development Kit (DDK), Edge AI PaaS, and the Azure Certified Device program. These components mitigate the challenges customers face by positioning a server-class infrastructure near Edge data sources and then using intelligent devices to gain real-time insights. This helps customers create solutions that focus on loss prevention, defect detection, and traffic management.
