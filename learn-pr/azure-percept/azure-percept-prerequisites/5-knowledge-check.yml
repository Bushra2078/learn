  questions:
  - content: "What role does Azure IoT Edge have in distributing AI workloads to the edge?"
    choices:
    - content: "IoT Edge deploys models that are built and trained in the cloud, and runs them on edge devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When IoT Edge deploys a model to the edge, a model can process data locally and respond to the event rapidly."
    - content: "IoT Edge can optimize network functionality."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The capabilities of the underlying network don't directly enable IoT Edge to run distributed workloads."
    - content: "IoT Edge can work with sensors on edge devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ability to connect to sensors doesn't enable IoT Edge to run distributed workloads."
  - content: "What is the main advantage of using Azure Cognitive Services?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your models run faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your models won't necessarily run faster with Azure Cognitive Services."
    - content: "You gain access to prebuilt models."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Cognitive Services offers access to prebuilt models."
    - content: "You use optimized hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cognitive Services doesn't require you to use specific hardware."
