  questions:
  - content: "Which properties of IoT Edge enables it to distribute AI workloads to the edge?"
    choices:
    - content: "IoT Edge deploys models that are built and trained in the cloud and then run them on edge devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When IoT Edge deploys a model to the edge, a model can process data locally and respond to the event rapidly."
    - content: "IoT Edge can optimize network functionality."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The capabilities of the underlying network don't directly enable IoT Edge to run distributed workloads."
    - content: "IoT Edge can work with sensors on edge devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ability to connect to sensors doesn't enable IoT Edge to run distributed workloads."
  - content: "What is the main advantage of using Azure Cognitive Services?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your models run faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your models won't necessarily run faster with Azure Cognitive Services."
    - content: "You gain access to prebuilt models."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Cognitive Services offers access to prebuilt models."
    - content: "You use optimized hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cognitive Services doesn't require you to use specific hardware."
  - content: "You're designing a new IoT solution, and you want the service to scale up to millions of simultaneously connected users. Which Azure product would you consider?"
    choices:
    - content: "IoT Edge, because it can handle edge analytics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Edge devices and edge analytics are independent of how the system scales as a whole."
    - content: "Azure Stream Analytics, because it can manage a large number of IoT streams."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Stream Analytics allows streaming to scale, as opposed to scaling the system as a whole."
    - content: "IoT Hub, because it allows you to scale to millions of simultaneously connected devices and millions of events per second to support your IoT workloads."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. IoT Hub allows you to both scale and manage your connected devices."
