Bicep lets you define your Azure resources in a simple language, and use templates to deploy the resources to Azure. Bicep lets you create templates that can be reused across multiple environments or applications.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're responsible for deploying and configuring the Azure infrastructure at a toy company. Your company is launching a new toy. You've been asked to deploy a new marketing website and other resources into Azure in preparation for the launch of the new product. You need to build the resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) techniques so that you can reuse the same templates for future product launches.

## What will we be doing?

Here, you'll create a template using Bicep to deploy a set of Azure resources for your product launches, and use many elements of the Bicep language in the process:

- Resource definitions, to deploy your Azure resources from your Bicep code.
- Parameters, variables, and expressions, to make your template reusable.
- Modules, to help to structure your template.
- Outputs, to send data from your template and modules back to whoever or whatever is deploying your infrastructure.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to create Bicep templates that define your Azure resources. You'll be able to use parameters, variables, and expressions to make your templates reusable. You'll also be able to use modules and outputs to organize your templates into separate files.
