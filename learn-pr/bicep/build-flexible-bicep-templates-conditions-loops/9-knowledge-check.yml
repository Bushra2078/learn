      You need to write a template that includes an Azure Policy assignment.
      This should only be deployed for production environments.
      What should you do?
    choices:
    - content: Define a resource for the policy assignment by using the *audit* effect, and just ignore any errors for non-production environments.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: It's not good practice to ignore policy violations. Instead, you should conditionally deploy the policy assignment so that it's only for your production environments.
    - content: Add a condition to your Bicep template so that the policy assignment is deployed only when the `environmentName` parameter value is set to `Production`.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: By using a condition with your resource declaration, you'll assign the policy only to environments that need it.
    - content: Move the policy assignment into its own module.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Putting the assignment into its own module won't achieve your goal to deploy the policy assignment only for your production environments.
  - content: Which one of the following is a good use case for loops?
    choices:
    - content: Deploying multiple resources that are almost identical but with some minor differences between them.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The copy loops feature enables you to deploy multiple resources that are identical or have minor differences.
    - content: Deploying the same resources to multiple environments.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You ordinarily use the same template with different deployment parameters when you're deploying resources to different environments. You use copy loops when you're creating multiple instances of resources within a single deployment.
    - content: Running custom code inside your Bicep file.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Loops can't be used to execute custom code.
  - content: How can you reference the current loop item within a Bicep loop?
    choices:
    - content: Use the `copyIndex()` function.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The `copyIndex()` function is used with JSON templates, not with Bicep templates.
    - content: Use array functions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Array functions are often useful when you're working with loops, but they don't let you access the current item.
    - content: Use the symbolic name you specified within the loop declaration.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You can access the current loop item by using the symbolic name that you used in the loop declaration.

      You used an array parameter to create a specified number of storage accounts.
      You need to return the storage account names for all the storage accounts you deploy so that users who run the deployment can see it.
      Which option should you use to return the storage account names?
    choices:
    - content: Use an output loop to return an array with the storage account names.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: By using an output loop, you can retrieve the name and other properties of the storage accounts you've deployed.
    - content: Use a variable loop to create a list of storage account names for each resource.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Variables aren't returned to users who are running the deployment.
    - content: Use the output function within a resource declaration loop.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Outputs, including output loops, must be declared separately from resources.
