quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You need to write a template that includes an Azure Policy definition. This should only be deployed for production environments. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define a resource for the Azure Policy definition using the audit effect, and just ignore any errors for non-production environments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Defining a resource in a template without condition will deploy resource to your environment regardless of deployment parameters, which is not goal you are trying to achieve."
    - content: "Add a condition to your Bicep template so that the policy definition is only deployed when an environmentName parameter is set to production."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using condition with resource declaration is correct way to control when resource should be deployed."
    - content: "Put the Azure Policy definition into its own module."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Putting Azure Policy definition into its own module won't achieve your goal to deploy Policy only for production environments. You should still use condition when declaring module in your template."
  - content: "Which of these is a good use case for loops?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploying multiple resources that are almost identical, but with some minor differences between them."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Copy loops enable you to deploy multiple resources that are identical or have minor differences."
    - content: "Deploying the same resources to multiple environments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Typically you would reuse same template with different deployment parameters when deploying resources to different environments. You use copy loops when creating multiple instances of resources."
    - content: "Writing custom functions to run inside your Bicep template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you might use loops inside custom functions, you would typically use copy loops when creating multiple instances of resources inside template."
  - content: "Which keyword should you use when you want to create multiple instances of resource?"
    choices:
    - content: "```if```"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "```if``` keyword is used when you want to conditionally deploy resources."
    - content: "```for```"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. ```for``` keyword is used when you want to use copy loops."
    - content: "```case```"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "```case``` is not keyword you use with declaration of copy loops."
    - content: "```when```"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "```when``` is not keyword you use with declaration of copy loops."
  - content: "How can you reference specific instance in loop?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use copyIndex() function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "copyIndex() function is used with ARM templates, not with Bicep templates."
    - content: "Use array functions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wrong. You should use iterator or loop index to reference specific instance in loop."
    - content: "Reference it by iterator name provided after for keyword"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Using iterator name you used in copy loop declaration is way to reference specific instance in loop."
  - content: "You used parameter value to create specified number of storage accounts. You need to retrieve storage account keys for all deployed storage accounts when deployment is finished. Which option should you use to retrieve required values?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use output loop to display storage account key for each deployed storage account instance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Using output loop you could retrieve properties of all storage accounts deployed with template."
    - content: "Use variable loop to display storage key for each storage account instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You wouldn't be able to retrieve storage account keys with variable loops."
    - content: "Use output function within resource declaration loop."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wrong. You should use output loops to retrieve properties of deployed resources."
