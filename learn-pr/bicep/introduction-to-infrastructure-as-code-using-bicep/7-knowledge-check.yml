### General guidance (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check) 
###  - Questions are complete sentences ending with a question mark 
###  - No true/false questions 
###  - 3 answers per question 
###  - All answers about the same length 
###  - Numeric answers listed in sorted order 
###  - No "All of the above" and/or "None of the above" as answer choices 
###  - No "Not" or "Except" in questions 
###  - No second person ("you") in the questions or answers 
###  - Provide a meaningful explanation for both correct and incorrect answers 
###
### Question content requirements:
###  - Write 5 questions
###  - Questions 1,2 must test this Learning Objective: "Describe how <attributes> of <product> work to <solve problem>"
###      Guidance: These two questions can be short, no need for a long scenario to analyze. Test if they understand how the product works.
###      Example: "What differentiates an action from a control action in an Azure Logic App?"
###  - Questions 3,4,5 must test this Learning Objective: "Evaluate whether <product> is appropriate to <general product use case>"
###      Guidance: Use scenario questions that ask the learner to analyze a situation with the "when to use" criteria presented in the module.
###      Example: "Suppose you work for a financial company. You're building a system to let your brokers trade financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you'll have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?"

quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you're deciding on a method for deploying your Azure infrastructure. Which of the following characteristics is a benefit of using infrastructure as code (IaC)?"
    choices:
    - content: "IaC Improves the consistency of your deployments."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Infrastructure as code will help reduce human error in resource provisioning, and ensure consistency."
    - content: "IaC requires that you only deploy a single environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IaC can help in managing multiple environments, like keeping your non-production and production environments in sync."
    - content: "With IaC, you manually execute your deployments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IaC helps you to automate your deployments, improving their consistency and reducing the chance of error."
  - content: "Suppose you've decided to use infrastructure as code for resource provisioning. You're deciding between using an imperative versus declarative code approach. Which statement best describes declarative code?"
    choices:
    - content: "With declarative code, you execute a sequence of commands, in a specific order, to reach an end configuration. This process defines what the code should accomplish, and it also defines how to accomplish the task. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Imperative code defines what the code should accomplish, and how to accomplish the task."
    - content: "With declarative code, objects and classes are used to determine the final configuration of a resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Object-oriented programming languages, such as C#, use objects and classes in their code base. You don't need to use these constructs for declarative IaC."
    - content: "With declarative code, you only specify the end configuration. You don't define how to accomplish the task."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Declarative code only specifies the properties and configuration of your resources. The tooling then determines how to ensure your resources meet those requirements."
  - content: "Suppose you're deciding on the type of declarative template to use for your resource provisioning. Which of the following declarative template formats work with Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Bicep template"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Bicep templates can be used for Azure resource deployments."
    - content: "XML template"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "XML templates aren't used for Azure resource deployments."
    - content: "Bash script using Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Bash script using Azure CLI isn't a declarative template."
  - content: "Suppose you're deciding on the type of declarative template to use for your resource provisioning. Which of the following characteristics is a benefit of using Azure Resource Manager templates?"
    choices:
    - content: "Imperative code"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Resource Manager templates don't use imperative code."
    - content: "Modularity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Resource Manager templates can be configured as separate templates, or modules."
    - content: "Management group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A management group is a logical container for grouping Azure subscriptions."
  - content: "Suppose you're reviewing how Bicep templates work for resource provisioning. What is the definition of a domain-specific language?"
    choices:
    - content: "A language that is designed to communicate with Active Directory Domain Services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A domain-specific language is designed for a particular scenario or domain. It isn't intended as a general programming language for writing applications."
    - content: "A language that is designed for a particular scenario or domain."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A domain-specific language is designed for a particular scenario or domain. It isn't intended as a general programming language for writing applications."
    - content: "A language that is designed as a general programming language for writing applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A domain-specific language is designed for a particular scenario or domain. It isn't intended as a general programming language for writing applications."
