TODO intro para

## Create a subscription-scoped template

1. Open Visual Studio Code, and create a new file called *main.bicep*. Save the empty file so that Visual Studio Code loads the Bicep tooling. You can select File > Save, or use the <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> keyboard shortcut (<kbd>âŒ˜+S</kbd> on macOS). Make sure you remember where you save the file - for example, you might want to create a **scripts** folder to save it in.

1. Add the following content into the file. You'll deploy the template soon. It's a good idea to type this in yourself instead of copying and pasting, so that you can see how the tooling helps you to write your Bicep files.

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template.bicep" range="1" :::

   Note that this line of code tells Bicep that your template is going to be deployed at a subscription scope.

## Add a policy definition

1. Underneath the line you just added, add the following variable definitions:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template.bicep" range="3-4" :::

1. At the bottom of the file, add the following Azure Policy definition:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template.bicep" range="6-38" :::

   Notice that the policy definition only applies to resources where:

   - The resource type is equal to `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`.
   - The `sku.name` property *either* begins with `Standard_F` or `Standard_G`.
  
   When you try to create a resource that matches these conditions, Azure will deny the resource creation.

   You are creating the policy definition at the scope of the subscription. The policy is available throughout all resource groups in the subscription.

## Assign the policy

A policy definition doesn't do anything until it's applied. In this step, you'll deploy a second subscription-scoped resource - this time, to apply the policy definition to the subscription.

1. Under the policy definition that you just added, add the following policy assignment:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template.bicep" range="40-45" :::

   Notice that you don't explicitly configure the policy assignment to apply to the whole subscription. Bicep understands this because the template will be deployed at the subscription scope.

1. Save the changes to the file.

## Verify your template

Your template should look like the following:

:::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template.bicep" :::

If it doesn't, either copy the example or adjust your template to match the example.

## Deploy the template

::: zone pivot="cli"

To deploy this template to Azure, you need to sign in to your Azure account from the Visual Studio Code terminal. Be sure you have the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true) tools installed, and sign in with the same account that you used to activate the sandbox.

1. Open a terminal window by using the **Terminal** menu.

1. If the drop-down menu on the right of the terminal window says **bash**, you have the right shell to work from and you can skip to the next section.

      :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/bash.png" alt-text="The Visual Studio Code terminal window with bash on the drop-down menu." border="true":::

1. If not, select the drop-down menu and choose **Select Default Shell**.
1. Select **bash**.

      :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/select-shell.png" alt-text="The Visual Studio Code terminal window showing the drop-down menu for selecting the shell." border="true":::

1. Select the plus sign (**+**) in the terminal to create a new terminal with **bash** as the shell.

### Sign in to Azure

1. From the terminal in Visual Studio Code, run the following command. A browser then opens so you can sign in to your Azure account.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. After you've signed in, you see a list of the subscriptions associated with this account in the terminal. Find the subscription that you want to use for this exercise. If you missed the list from the sign-in, you can use the following snippet to list your subscriptions again.

    ```azurecli
    az account list --output tsv
    ```

1. Set the default subscription for all of the Azure CLI commands that you run in this session.

    ```azurecli
    az account set --subscription "Your Subscription Name or ID"
    ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

To deploy this template to Azure, you need to sign in to your Azure account from the Visual Studio Code terminal. Be sure you have [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-4.3.0&azure-portal=true&preserve-view=true) installed, and sign in to the same account that activated the sandbox.

1. Open a terminal window by using the **Terminal** menu.

1. If the drop-down menu on the right of the terminal window says **pwsh**, you have the right shell to work from and you can skip to the next section.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/pwsh.png" alt-text="The Visual Studio Code terminal window with p w s h on the drop-down menu." border="true":::

    If not, select the drop-down menu and choose **Select Default Shell**.

1. Select **pwsh**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/select-shell.png" alt-text="The Visual Studio Code terminal window showing the drop-down list for selecting the default shell." border="true":::

1. Select **+** in the terminal to create a new terminal with **pwsh** as the shell.

### Sign in to Azure by using Azure PowerShell

1. From the terminal in Visual Studio Code, run the following command to sign in to Azure. A browser opens so you can sign in to your account. Use the code in the prompt.

    ```azurepowershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Get the ID of the subscription that you want to use for this exercise. The following command will list your subscriptions and their IDs. 

    ```azurepowershell
    Get-AzSubscription
    ```
    The subscription ID is the second column. Copy the second column. It looks something like *cf49fbbc-217c-4eb6-9eb5-a6a6c68295a0*. 

1. Set the default subscription for all of the Azure PowerShell commands that you run in this session.

    ```azurepowershell
    Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId {Your subscription ID}
    ```

::: zone-end

### Deploy the template to Azure

::: zone pivot="cli"

Deploy the template by using Azure CLI commands in the Visual Studio Code terminal.

```azurecli
templateFile="main.bicep"
today=$(date +"%d-%b-%Y")
deploymentName="new-subscription

az deployment sub create \
    --name $deploymentName \
    --location westus \
    --template-file $templateFile
```

Notice that you are creating a subscription-scoped deployment by using the `az deployment sub create` command, instead of the `az deployment group create` command you might be used to.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

Deploy the template by using Azure PowerShell commands in the terminal.

```azurepowershell
$templateFile = "main.bicep"
$deploymentName = "new-subscription"

New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
  -Name $deploymentName `
  -Location westus `
  -TemplateFile $templateFile
```

Notice that you are creating a subscription-scoped deployment by using the `New-AzSubscriptionDeployment` cmdlet, instead of the `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment` cmdlet you might be used to.

::: zone-end

Also, notice that you are explicitly specifying a name and location for the deployment. Azure uses this information to store the deployment metadata.

The deployment might take a minute or two to complete, and then you'll see a successful deployment.

## Verify the deployment

You can view subscription-scoped deployments in the Azure portal. This can be helpful to verify that the deployment has finished successfully and to inspect the results.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

1. On the left-side panel, select **Subscriptions**.

1. Select your subscription.

1. At the top of the left menu, in the **Search** box, enter **Deployments** and select the **Deployments** menu item.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal interface showing the search field and the Deployments menu item." border="true":::

1. Select the deployment called **new-subscription** to see what resources were deployed.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-deployment-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal interface showing the list of deployments." border="true":::

1. Select **Deployment details** to expand it. In this case, the two Azure Policy resources are listed.
