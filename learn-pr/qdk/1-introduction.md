The Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit (QDK) comprises a wide range of tools which give developers everything they need to start writing quantum programs. The QDK uses programming language Q#, which provides quantum programmers a framework to focus on the algorithms without having to worry about technical details like gate sequence optimization or the physical implementation of a quantum computer.
