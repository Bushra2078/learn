In this unit you are going to learn how to build a quantum random number
generator, which happens to be a perfect example to introduce the Quantum
Development Kit to combine quantum and classical programs.

One of most direct the applications of quantum devices is the generation of
verified random numbers. We can perform measurements on quantum systems to
obtain pure random values.

In SchrÃ¶dinger's cat thought experiment, if we open the box to check if the cat
is dead or alive, the quantum state of the cat randomly collapses into one of
the two classical states. Since the state of the cat can be encoded with a
single bit (0 -> Alive, 1 -> Dead), when we open the box we're generating a
random bit.

We can encode any random integer or float into a bit-string, depending on the
number of decimals and size of our number. Therefore, to generate pure random
numbers we just need to generate many pure random bits.

In real life, cats can't be put in a quantum superposition (and of course we
don't want to possibly kill many cats to generate a random number). However, the
basic elements of quantum computers, the qubits, can be driven to a quantum
superposition and measured like when we open the cat's box.
