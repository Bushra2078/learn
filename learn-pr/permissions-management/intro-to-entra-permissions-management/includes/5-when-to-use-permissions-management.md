## When to use Entra Permissions Management ###
Here we'll look at how Entra Permissions Management fits in the landscape of cloud security, and within the full security offerings from Microsoft.

Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) enhances an overall set of cloud security tools by providing a correlation between entitlements across your cloud infrastructure. CIEM delivers access to monitoring, analysis of identies and permissions, and efficient detection and remediation of suspicious activity.
