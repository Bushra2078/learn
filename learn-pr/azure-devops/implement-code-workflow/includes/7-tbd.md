Not sure we need **more**, but as a bonus, consider having the learner do something a bit trickier. Perhaps one of:

* Push up a change that breaks the build (we'll do this later for sure!)
* Involves some other collaboration with a teammate.
* Involves some sort of merge conflict (might be overwhelming if you're new to this...)
