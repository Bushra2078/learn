Here we discuss some strategies teams use to flow up changes.

Summarize how the team currently uses source control. (We suggest a naive strategy in the first LP.)

The JTA calls for "Recommend a repository structure and creation strategy".

Discuss various branching strategies & policies. The JTA mentions:

* feature flag
* hotfix
* release

Discuss Git's PR, approval & integration process.
Discuss how this fits in with a CI pipeline.
