Here we have the learner practice the flow of moving changes into the pipeline, starting from their local development environment.

1. Propose a change to the app (a basic one, such as modifying the text on the homepage or similar.)
1. Build & run it locally through the Cloud Shell.
1. Commit the change, push it up.
1. Submit a PR, ask for reviewers.
    (Is it too much to configure the process such that approval is _required_? Might make things tricky given you'd need a second account to make the approval...)
1. After the change is approved, watch the build happen.
1. See the artifact come out the other end.
