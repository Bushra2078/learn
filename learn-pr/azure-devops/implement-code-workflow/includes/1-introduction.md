OK, you've connected your app on GitHub to an Azure pipeline. Now you're ready to start using pipelines for what they're meant for - collaborate with your team to quickly and safely move changes through the pipeline.

Notes:

Goals:

- working with others; group collaboration
- less emphasis on web interface; more on code and CLI tooling
  - local Git => .yml for instance
- triggers
- approvals and gates
- propose a change
  - get it working locally
  - push up branch; submit PR
  - watch the branch build and succeed
  - get reviewer(s)
  - merge it
  - build it
- add a build badge
- dashboard
