Discuss how a dashboard can help you visualize your builds over time.

Have the learner set one up and add widgets to track PRs & build history.

Notes from spike:

## Set up the dashboard

- Navigate to **Overview**, **Dashboards**
- Click **Add a widget**
- Drag **Build History** to the (canvas).
  - If you don't see this widget, search for it in the search bar.
- Click the gear icon to configure the widget.
  - Keep the title **Build History**.
  - From **Pipeline**, select your pipeline.
  - Keep **All branches** selected.
- Click **Save**.
- Click **Done Editing**.

Describe what the widget does and what you can do with it.

TODO: Perhaps also add **Code Tile** and **Pull Requests** to give it a bit more richness. (Update: couldn't seem to connect these to GitHub repos. Are these widgets for Azure DevOps Repos?)
