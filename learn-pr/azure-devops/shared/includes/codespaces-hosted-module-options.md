This module includes the option to use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or a [Microsoft-hosted agent](/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted). If you'd like to use a Microsoft-hosted agent, [check your parallel jobs and request a free grant](/azure/devops/pipelines/troubleshooting/troubleshooting#check-for-available-parallel-jobs). You can choose either option, but if you decide to change approaches after starting the module, you must restart the module using the new approach.
