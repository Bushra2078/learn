### Set your project's visibility

Your fork of the _Space Game_ repository on GitHub is initially public. The Azure DevOps template creates a project that's initially private.

A public GitHub repository is accessible to everyone, while a private repository is accessible to you and the people you share it with. In both cases, only collaborators can commit changes to a GitHub repository.

A project on Azure DevOps works the same way. Users that aren't signed into the service have read-only access to public projects. Private projects, on the other hand, require users to be granted access to the project and signed in to access the services.

For learning purposes, you don't need to change any of these settings right now. But for your own projects, you need to decide what visibility and access you want to provide to others. For example, if your project is open source, you might make both your GitHub repository and your Azure DevOps project public. If your project is closed source, you would likely make both your GitHub repository and your Azure DevOps project private.
