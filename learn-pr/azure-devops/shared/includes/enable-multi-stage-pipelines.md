## Turn on multistage pipelines in Azure DevOps

Multistage pipelines are a preview feature of Azure Pipelines. Preview features provide early access to features that will soon become part of Azure DevOps. For now, you need to turn on this feature.

From Azure DevOps:

1. Select your profile.
1. Select the ellipsis (**...**) button, and then select **Preview features**.
1. Turn on **Multistage pipelines**.

1. Notice that separate entries for **Release** and **Build** no longer appear on the **Pipelines** menu. You'll now build and release from the same pipeline.
