> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that a more robust configuration might specify the branches that participate in the build process. For example, to help verify code quality, you might want to run unit tests each time you push up a change on any branch. But you might also want to deploy the application to an environment that performs more exhaustive testing only when you have a pull request, a release candidate, or merge your code to `master`.
