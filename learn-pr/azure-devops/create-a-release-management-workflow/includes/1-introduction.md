NOTES:

* This is the second module in LP3.
* In the first module, you built a basic CD pipeline that deploys the application to AppService.
* Here, you'll extend the pipeline to deploy the application to multiple environments so that it can be built, tested, and validated through the various development stages.
* Although you can design a release management workflow that works for you and your team, here you'll deploy to development, test, and pre-production environments, each running on AppService.
* FOR JUDY: **Implement Blue Green Deployment > Deployment Slots** defines deployment slots. Add this to M1?

The prerequisites are the same as the [Create a build pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-a-build-pipeline?azure-portal=true) module.

Make sure you have the _Space Game_ project loaded in Visual Studio Code and your _Space Game_ project on GitHub handy.

## Meet the team
