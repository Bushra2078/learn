Scenario:
* Amita does some manual testing (will automate things further in the next module).
* Amita sets up a release gate that uses a work item query to check for 0 open bugs (see release gate demo).
* Idea: Create a bug on Azure Boards and have the learner resolve it and see the gate pass, just like the release gate demo.
