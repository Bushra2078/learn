Just like gathering feedback helps you build better experiences for your users, collecting and acting on monitoring data helps you build services that perform better and are more resilient to failure.

Ensuring that your development and operations teams have access to the same telemetry and tools enables them to view patterns across your entire environment. Building a dashboard or connecting Azure monitoring to your existing ITSM tools can help you achieve this.
