Course > Design a Release Strategy > Choosing a Deployment Pattern > Choosing a deployment pattern

The team talks about the best way to get a feature deployed to production. 

Currently, a build is deployed to pre-production and the management team must set up a meeting to demo the feature and approve the deployment to production.
Tim has to manually deploy the build that is on staging over to production after approval. 
This process takes 5 days according to our map.
They decide to look into deployment patterns to see their best fit for faster deployments to production.

ILT also mentions that some things just have to be tested in production and these deployment patterns help facilitate that. This is a good point to make with the team.
Amita is on board with this too.
