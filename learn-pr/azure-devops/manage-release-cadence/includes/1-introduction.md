Throughout this learning path, you helped the Tailspin team set up an automated CI/CD pipeline, complete with multiple stages and both functional and non-functional tests. 

In this module, you help the team solve another problem. How do they implement a deployment pattern that lets them release to production in a way that's best both for the company and for their users? You'll help them evaluate the different possibilities and then implement the one they decide on.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn why deployment patterns matter
- Compare different deployment patterns so you can choose the one that best suits your needs
- Create a Blue Green deployment in Azure DevOps for the Space Game web site

## Prerequisites

TODO: Update

The prerequisites are the same as the [Create a build pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-a-build-pipeline?azure-portal=true) module.

Make sure you have the _Space Game_ project loaded in Visual Studio Code and your _Space Game_ project on GitHub handy.

## Meet the team

You met the _Space Game_ web team at Tailspin Toys in previous modules. As a refresher, here's who you'll work with in this module.
