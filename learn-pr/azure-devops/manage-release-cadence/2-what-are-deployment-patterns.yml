quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "The marketing team has asked you to add a banner to your company's website. They have two versions of this banner and they want to know which one produces more click-throughs. Which deployment pattern might you use to help marketing achieve their goals?"
    choices:
    - content: "Blue-green deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A blue-green deployment is better suited to helping you reduce downtime."
    - content: "A/B testing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "With A/B testing, you could show both variations of the website to users at random. Then the marketing team can use statistical analysis to decide which variation performs better."
    - content: "Feature toggles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Feature toggles are better suited to exposing new features to a small, select number of users to see how they react."
  - content: "You have a new feature for your website that you're ready to deploy. However, this feature is risky because it changes the way your users interact with the site. Which deployment patterns might you consider using to release to a small group of early adopters who have signed up to see new features?"
    choices:
    - content: "Canary release or progressive exposure deployment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Both of these deployment patterns expose a new feature to only a small subset of your users. After you validate the feature with this smaller subset, you can then progressively roll out to a larger set of customers."
    - content: "A/B testing or a dark launch."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A/B testing is typically used to sample users at random. With a dark launch, users typically don't know they're being used as test users."
    - content: "Blue-green deployment or feature toggles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you might use a feature toggle to expose your feature to select users, a blue-green deployment is meant to help you reduce downtime."
  - content: "You're not sure how your users will react to your new feature. You want to release your feature to a small, random sampling of users to see how they react. Which deployment pattern might you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Blue-green deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A blue-green deployment is better suited to helping you reduce downtime."
    - content: "Dark launch."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Because you want a random sample, a dark launch can help you gradually release your feature while you collect feedback and test performance."
    - content: "A/B testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although A/B testing is typically used to sample users at random, it's more commonly used to test two or more variations of a feature against each other."
