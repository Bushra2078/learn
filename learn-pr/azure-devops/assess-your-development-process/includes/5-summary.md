As you can see, Mara and her team face a number of challenges. Although releases happen, Mara feels they can happen much more frequently and efficiently. Plus, Mara hates working longer hours when it's not necessary.

Mara plans to bring her findings to the team. Perhaps that will help convince them that it's at least worth testing out a DevOps approach to finish up work on the _Space Game_ web site.

## What is DevOps?

At this point, we have not yet defined DevOps. We'll do that in the next module. But for now, think of DevOps as something that brings together people, processes and products, automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users.

Azure DevOps is a suite of services that spans the entire DevOps lifecycle. Azure DevOps starts with planning and goes all the way through deployment and monitoring. If you already have some pieces in place, you can select which Azure DevOps services you want to use and integrate them with existing tools, such as Jenkins.

## Take the assessment for yourself

Try taking the Self-Assessment for your own group. If you have more detailed knowledge of your group than Mara does for hers, use the longer form.

Go to [devopsassessment.net](https://devopsassessment.net?azure-portal=true) to start your assessment.
