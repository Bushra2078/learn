# Microsoft DevOps Self-Assessment

Alice is going to take the [Microsoft DevOps Self-Assessment](https://devopsassessment.net). 

She knows she doesn't understand everything so she's going to use the shorter form. Taking the assessment is a good first step. It will give the team an overall view of where they are in the DevOps process. With the results, everyone on the team has a common starting point for identifying the first steps towards improving Tailspin's release process.

## The Results

Alice gets back a graph.

[INSERT IMAGE]

The graph summarizes depicts the team's progress for each of the Self-Assessment categories. Each category is a point. The further the point is from the center, the more mature the team is for that category. 

The blue boundary that connects the points makes it easy to see the team's overall progress. For example, the Tailspin team is further along in Culture, Technology and Outcomes than it is in Measurement and Process. You can also hover over a point to get a numerical value, which is another way to compare results for each category.


## Optional Activity
Try taking the Self-Assessment for your own group. If you have more detailed knowledge of your group than Alice does for hers, use the longer form.
