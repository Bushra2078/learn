[Repeat the format from the previous unit, this time focusing on outcomes.]

[Again, we'll need to define how we approach/talk about the Q&A sessions the team's resident DevOps expert conducted, but here are some key questions they may have discussed:]

* How long does it take to go from "idea" to "production"?
  * Answer:
    * (We discussed this in parts throughout.)
    * To summarize, the team takes a largely waterfall approach, with a team handoff at each step.
    * It can take weeks to months to deploy new features or resolve bugs.
  * Analysis:
    * Changes roll out slowly to customers. Customers notice.
    * Competing companies seem to be delivering faster and are taking market share.
    * A failure at one stage (for example, high severity bug, security issue, or production failure) causes the process to start again from the top.

* How long does it typically take to resolve a service incident (such as an unplanned outage)?
  * Answer:
    * (Do we talk about an SLA that the team has with customers? I guess we need to define the products they create first to see if that fits.)
    * Operations doesn't utilize a whole lot of "backup servers", so the team needs to resolve live site incidents quickly. Even if that means bringing in the entire team to help investigate.
  * Analysis:
    * When an incident does require additional investigation, it's stressful on the team because there's no "safety net" to redirect traffic to.

* What's the general sense of workplace satisfaction?
  * Answer:
    * Those who have been at the company a long time tend to stay there.
    * Those who have joined more recently are more likely to leave.
    * When members leave the team, they typically leave the company as well. Many cite lack of resources and opportunities to learn & grow as the main factor.
  * Analysis:
    * As the "long timers" eventually leave, management worries how they'll attract and retain new talent.

[Ideas welcome, but for knowledge check questions, perhaps we provide short scenarios and ask the learner to draw an analysis or conclusion. The challenge would be to keep them short. Or possibly extend some of the team's scenarios and ask follow-up questions. At the very least, don't rehash or have the learner memorize the team's workflow or analysis.]
