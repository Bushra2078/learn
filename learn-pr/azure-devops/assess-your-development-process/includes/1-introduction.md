# Introduction
Do you want to improve your release process? Maybe you want to increase the frequency of your releases. Maybe you want to increase the quality of your software. Maybe you want to get rid of some manual processes and move toward a more automated approach. Whatever your goals, Azure DevOps can help.

## What is DevOps
DevOps brings together people, processes and products, automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. 

## What is Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps is a suite of services that spans the entire DevOps lifecycle. Azure DevOps starts with planning and goes all the way through deployment and monitoring. If you already have some pieces in place, you can select which Azure DevOps services you want to use and integrate them with existing tools, such as Jenkins. Azure DevOps consists of: 

* Azure Boards. Track your work with Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom reporting.
* Azure Pipelines. Implement CI/CD with cloud-hosted pipelines for Linux, Windows and macOS.
* Azure Repos. Get unlimited private Git repo hosting and support for TFVC.
* Azure Test Plans. Get end-to-end traceability for your applications.
* Azure Artifacts. Create and share Maven, npm, and NuGet package feeds.

Remember that you can use all of these services together or select the ones you want and integrate them with your existing toolset.

## The Azure DevOps Learning Track
The Azure DevOps Learning Track is an interactive set of modules that will show you how to use the Azure DevOps services. You’ll work with a fictitious team at Tailspin, a game company, as they use Azure DevOps to evaluate and improve their software release process. Let’s get started with Unit 1, Meet the Team.
