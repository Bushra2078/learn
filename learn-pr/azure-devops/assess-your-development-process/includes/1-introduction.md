[Introduce the learner to the team, personas, and challenges we'll follow throughout the learning path.]

[Make the case for an organization that has challenges around communication, is slow to release, releases with too many bugs, and tackles security and compliance either too late in the process or not at all.]

[This is an opportunity to connect with the learner. Tell a story that the learner can relate to - either habits they're doing, have seen others do, or can imagine others doing.]

[Mention that someone on the team has had experience bringing DevOps into his/her prior team. He/she offers to facilitate a discussion these five areas:

* Process
* Technology
* Culture
* Measurement
* Outcomes

Idea is to identify & analyze current processes (what's currently done, what's working, what's not) and then make recommendations on how to improve and where to start.]

[Have the learner get out a sheet of paper and make notes on their team's processes as they follow along. At the end, they'll be able to take our DevOps assessment so they can begin to make recommendations for their own org.]
