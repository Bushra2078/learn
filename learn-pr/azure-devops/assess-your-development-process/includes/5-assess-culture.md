[Repeat the format from the previous unit, this time focusing on workplace interactions.]

[Again, we'll need to define how we approach/talk about the Q&A sessions the team's resident DevOps expert conducted, but here are some key questions they may have discussed:]

* Who makes decisions in the organization?
  * Answer:
    * (We mentioned earlier that management decides priorities.)
    * (We also mentioned earlier that engineering takes on bug fixes and other minor improvements when they think necessary and have time.)
    * [Summarize or say something unique here]
  * Analysis:
    * Neither team leads nor individuals feel empowered to make the right choices.

* How do teams approach experimentation and risk?
  * Answer:
    * Management is largely "risk-adverse".
    * The teams see limited opportunity to experiment and try new things. "There's no time and everything is tied to production."
    * When the team tried something new and it failed, individuals were called out and blamed in front of others.
  * Analysis:
    * Management doesn't understand the value of experimentation and taking healthy risks.
    * Opportunities are lost to improve efficiencies (for example, release faster, progressive exposure or A/B test new features, and so on) and business outcomes (for example, better user experience, increased growth).
    * A culture of blame makes teams hesitant to even want to try new things.

* How do teams share knowledge and learnings among themselves?
  * Answer:
    * Teams feel siloed, so they don't see the need to meet often to share information.
    * Even within teams, not everyone gets the information when there's a change or key learning.
      * For example, bugs the QA team discovers, better coding approaches on the development team.
  * Analysis:
    * Teams miss out on opportunities to improve.
    * For example (pick a better one if you can think of it), operations resolved a memory leak by upgrading to more powerful hardware. A better approach might have been to bring in engineering to fix the issue in the codebase.
    * Opportunities are lost to grow and improve within teams. Individuals continue to make the same mistakes.

[Ideas welcome, but for knowledge check questions, perhaps we provide short scenarios and ask the learner to draw an analysis or conclusion. The challenge would be to keep them short. Or possibly extend some of the team's scenarios and ask follow-up questions. At the very least, don't rehash or have the learner memorize the team's workflow or analysis.]
