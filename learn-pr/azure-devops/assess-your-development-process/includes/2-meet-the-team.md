[Introduce the learner to the fictitious team they'll follow throughout. Break it down into dev, QA, and ops teams. Mention the size of each team, give names to the major players (team leads and so on), and describe a few interesting characteristics about the team.]

[Don't belabor things here, as folks don't necessarily care about a team that doesn't actually exist. But frame it to say that we'll be following this team through their journey, so it's good to know a little bit about them.]

### What applications does the team build?

[Here we identify existing applications, services and hosting infrastructure.]

[Say that the team has a number of apps that they build on and maintain. Some apps are old and are built using older build tools. Some are newer and are built against more modern tooling. Some apps are internal and are external. Everything is deployed to an on-prem datacenter.]

[Describe and show a screenshot of our reference application - the external app that the team wants to focus on first. Explain that it's a .NET Core app written in C# that's deployed to Linux.]

### What are the team's biggest challenges?

* Slow to release
* Release with too many bugs
* Not shipping the right features to customers

-----

Grab bag to place elsewhere:

* That's painful because it's difficult to scale up or down to accommodate changes in user traffic.
* Perhaps identify other pain points (things that typically drive cloud migration).
