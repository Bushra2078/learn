# Meet the Team
**Goal**: The goal of this unit is to fill out and submit the Microsoft DevOps Self-Assessment test.

Tailspin is a game company with a number of apps. All of them are deployed to an on-prem datacenter. One of the company’s games is a product called Tailspin Galaxies. It’s a .NET Core app written in C# that’s deployed to Linux. One team works on the application itself and another team, the one you’ll be working with, is responsible for the leader board. 

Here's what the leaderboard looks like right now.

Here are your team members.

[INSERT FACES WHEN THEY'RE AVAILABLE]

**Bob**. Bob is a developer who’s been working with computers since he was a kid. His hobby is working on open source projects with other programmers from all over the world.

**Carol**. Carol is in QA. She’s calm, which helps with some temperamental developers. She’s good at organizing and setting priorities and lives to find edge cases.

**Ted**. Ted is in operations. He likes practical solutions and he’s very cautious (although some people might use the word “paranoid”), which makes sense because he’s the person who gets the 3AM call when something goes wrong.

**Alice**. Alice is new. She just joined Tailspin as a developer because she likes games and she thought a smaller company would have lots of opportunity for innovation. She’s a big fan of DevOps.

## Good Morning
The team’s product manager has called everyone into a meeting and he’s in a bad mood. The game’s leaderboard was just released with several new features and he showed it at a Meetup group. Players’ reactions were disappointing, to say the least. He reads off a list of the top problems:

* Some features only work correctly for some game modes.
* Updating the board takes too long, even with a small number of players.
* Multiple scores per user show up as multiple users.
* The new ranking feature returns incorrect results.
* There’s no way to group scores according to a specific date or game session.
* It took months to get the new release (and it's broken).

He demands, “How long before these problems are fixed?”

Bob thinks: I bet it takes me a month to write that code.

Carol thinks: It’ll take me at least a week to test this and I can’t start until Bob is finished and he always wants to sneak in new code. 

Ted thinks: It will take me at least a week to set up the environments and deploy this to production. I can’t start until Carol is finished and she’s never willing to call something a release candidate.

Alice thinks: I should have taken that job at Microsoft.

Bob looks around at his team mates and says, “We’ll get back to you.”
