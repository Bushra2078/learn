After the product manager leaves, Amita says, "We need help. I don't know when he wants the new rev, but I do know it's soon. We're not set up for a fast turnaround. Plus, the new _Space Game_ web site will have to wait until we get this mess solved &mdash; and the game is releasing soon."

Andy looks at Mara. "This is a lot to take in on your first few weeks here."

"That's okay," she answers. "Maybe you can explain to me how things work around here. How does a game move from dev to production?"

"That's a great question," says Andy. I'm not sure we can give you a simple answer but let's try."

The team decides to go to a coffee shop to relax and have an informal discussion. Together, they'll try to figure out why they're having so many problems.

<!-- TODO: Might be nice to include a graphic that shows a whiteboard image with stickies or a notebook to represent the coffee-shop conversation. -->

Over coffee, Mara listens and tries to take notes. There's a lot of information and it's not organized. Her overall thoughts about the team are:

* They use a waterfall approach. Management sets the priorities. Developers write code and hand off to QA. QA tests and then hands off to ops for deployment.
* There's no clear definition of what "done" means. Each team member has his or her own definition.
* Some code is in a centralized version-control system. Many tools and scripts exist only on network file shares.
* There are a lot of manual processes.
* Communication is haphazard and depends on email, Word docs, and spreadsheets.
* Feedback is also infrequent and inconsistent.

<!-- TODO: Let's be clearer on why the negatives are negative. At the same time, are there any positives? -->

When she looks at her pile of notes, Mara knows she needs to organize all this information so she can evaluate it. She's convinced that a DevOps approach will solve many of the team's problems, but she needs a way to present her case to the team.

"Have any of you ever taken the Microsoft DevOps Self-Assessment?" Andy rolls his eyes, Amita sighs, and Tim says, "We don't need more paperwork."

Mara says, "I get it. Leave it to me."

Glad to let the newbie handle it, everyone heads back to work.
