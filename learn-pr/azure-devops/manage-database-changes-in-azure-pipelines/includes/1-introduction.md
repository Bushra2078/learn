In this module, you connect a web application to a database and manage changes to the database schema in Azure Pipelines.

In [Create a multi-stage pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-multi-stage-pipeline?azure-portal=true), you helped the Tailspin web team design and build a multi-stage release pipeline. This pipeline enables the team to move changes through a series of stages, such as the _Dev_ stage and the _Test_ stage, all the way out to _Staging_ stage that resembles production.

The stages that you and the team defined provide the overall shape of the pipeline, but there's more that you can add to each stage. For example, in the _Dev_ stage you can verify that multiple components, such as the web application and a database, work together in a real, working environment.

However, the web application still reads test data from local files. In this module, you connect the website to Azure SQL Database and load your database with sample data.

When an application uses a database, the database administrator (DBA) and the app developers must work together to design and maintain the *database schema*. Think of the schema as a blueprint that dictates how the data will be organized. Azure DevOps can help developers and DBAs coordinate their plans and deploy database schema changes quickly and safely.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you:

- Connect a relational database to your website, using Azure SQL Database and Azure App Service as an example.
- Coordinate changes to the database schema by using a release approval.
- Use PowerShell to share variables among pipeline stages.

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression.

To follow the progression from the beginning, be sure to first complete these learning paths:

* [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true)
* [Build applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops?azure-portal=true)

We also recommend you start at the beginning of this learning path, [Deploy applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/deploy-applications-with-azure-devops?azure-portal=true).

If you want to go through just this module, you need to set up a development environment on your Windows, macOS, or Linux system. You need:

* An [Azure DevOps organization](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true)
* An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true)
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/join?azure-portal=true) account
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true)
* [.NET Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download?azure-portal=true)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads?azure-portal=true)

You can get started with Azure and Azure DevOps for free.

This environment lets you complete the exercises in this and future modules. You can also use it to apply your new skills to your own projects.
