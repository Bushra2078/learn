The Tailspin team is applying all of their DevOps skills in the devlvery and deployment of their web site. They are getting ready to move to the final stage and deploy to a live production environment so the reliability of their web site is on their minds as they get ready to go live. 

Because they will be continuously publishing using their pipeline, they know that there may be reliability issues that need constant monitoring and the team will need to be notified so that they can address these issues. 

Let's listen in as they discuss their concerns.

## The morning meeting

Talk about who is going to 
oversee deployments, monitor overall performance, review error logs, and troubleshoot software defects. Who owns this area?

That person is the SRE

## What is site reliability engineering?

Site reliability engineering (SRE) empowers software developers to own the ongoing daily operation of their applications in production. The goal is to bridge the gap between the development team that needs to ship continuously, and the operations team that that is responsible for the reliability of the production environment. Site reliability engineering shifts the responsibility of production reliability to the SRE on the development team.

Site reliability engineers typically spend up to 50% of their time on the daily reliability tasks of the software application, and the rest of their time on their development assignments.

A key skill of a software reliability engineer is that they have a deep understanding of the application. This includes knowledge of the web site code, how it runs, how it is configured, and how it scales.

Some of the typical responsibilities of a site reliability engineer include:

- Proactively monitor and review application performance
- Handle on-call and emergency support
- Ensure software has good logging and diagnostics
- Create and maintain operational runbooks
- Help triage escalated support tickets
- Work on feature requests, defects and other development tasks
- Contribute to the overall product roadmap
- Perform live site reviews and capture feedback for system outages

## Site reliability engineering vs DevOps

DevOps builds a healthy working relationship between the operations staff and development team. It allows each to see how their work influences and affects the other. By combining knowledge and effort, DevOps produces a more robust, reliable, agile product.

Both SRE and DevOps are methodologies addressing organizationsâ€™ needs for production operation management. As you have seen in the previous modules, DevOps feedback systems can raise problems and dispatch them to developers to solve. The SRE approach uses a person on the development team to look for issues with site reliability daily and likely solve those problems themselves. While DevOps teams would usually choose to leave the production environment untouched unless absolutely necessary, SREs will likely make changes in the production environment.

## Which should I choose?

TODO: The team debates on using both. 

## Site reliability engineering skills

The type of skills needed will vary wildly based on your type of application, how and where it is deployed, and how it is monitored. For example, organizations using Serverless technologies will not need someone with in-depth knowledge of Windows or Linux systems management. However, this skill is critical to teams using servers for deployments.

Other key skills for a good site reliability engineer are focused on application monitoring and diagnostics. They should have experience with application performance management tools like Application Insights. They should also understand application logging best practices and exception handling.

## The future of site reliability engineering

Software developers are increasingly taking a larger role in deployments, production operations, and application monitoring. The tools available today make it extremely easy to deploy applications and to monitor them. This makes it easy for developers to own their projects from ideation all the way to production.
