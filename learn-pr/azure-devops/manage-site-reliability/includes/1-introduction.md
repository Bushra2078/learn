DevOps practices encourage software developers to take a larger role in operations and application monitoring. Recent advances in tooling make it easier for developers to own their projects from creation all the way to production.

In this module, you learn about managing site reliability, which includes telemetry analysis, alerting on-site reliability symptoms, and analyzing and tuning your alerts.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn how site reliability engineering (SRE) empowers software developers to own the ongoing daily operation of their applications in production.
- Learn how Application Insights analyzes the performance of your web application and can warn you about potential problems.
- Learn about processes that you can implement to monitor site reliability.
- See how blameless postmortems encourage a "just culture" that balances safety and accountability.

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path and previous learning paths form a progression.

You can take just this module, but if you want to follow the progression from the beginning, be sure to first complete these learning paths:

* [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true)
* [Build applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops?azure-portal=true)
* [Deploy applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/deploy-applications-with-azure-devops/?azure-portal=true)
* [Automate your deployments with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/automate-deployments-azure-devops/?azure-portal=true)

We also recommend that you start at the beginning of the [Capture feedback and monitoring data to continuously improve your software](/learn/paths/capture-feedback-monitoring?azure-portal=true) learning path.

## Meet the team
