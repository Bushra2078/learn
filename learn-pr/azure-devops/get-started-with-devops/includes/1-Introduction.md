In the [previous module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/assess-your-development-process?azure-portal=true), you met the team at Tailspin Toys. They're working on a new game but they've got many problems with their release process. These problems are affecting the quality of the products they deliver to their customers. The team knows they need to change but they don't know how.
