Azure DevOps can help your team release code in a more efficient, cooperative, and stable manner. Let's rejoin the team as they learn about DevOps. We'll discover with them what it takes to get an Azure DevOps practice started.

In the [previous module](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/assess-your-development-process?azure-portal=true), you met the team at Tailspin Toys. They're working on a new game but they've got many problems with their release process. These problems are affecting the quality of the products they deliver to their customers. The team knows they need to change but they don't know how.

The newest team member, Mara, believes DevOps will help. Her goal is to convince her teammates. She'll explain the results of the DevOps Assessment that was filled out in the previous module. Hopefully, the explanation will show the team why DevOps is the way forward.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn what DevOps is and identify what separates elite performers from low performers
- Identify what services Azure DevOps provides
- Set up an account in Azure DevOps
