(Here we have the learner run a [template](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/) that populates their Azure DevOps account with starter data for this module. It should be in the state where the previous module left off.)

* Boards pre-populated with work.
* Pipeline in place and able to accept build requests.

## Task

- Run template.
- Add cards to Azure Boards to queue up work.
    - Move card to Doing
    - For example, maybe Mara is tasked with setting up the build pipeline. Someone else might set up the dashboard.
