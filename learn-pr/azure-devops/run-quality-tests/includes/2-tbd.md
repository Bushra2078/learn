**TODO**: This unit needs a title. But let's settle on what it talks about and then set a title to match.

Here, we survey the various kinds of testing and what test frameworks are available to you.

### What are the types of testing?

List and describe some of the more common types of testing. Some thoughts that come to mind:

* Lint
* Unit
* Integration
* Code coverage
* UAT / manual testing
* UI
* Regression
* Security and compliance
* And so on...

### What is automated testing?

Perhaps choose a different title, but perhaps emphasize the value of running automated tests versus doing just manual testing.

And _maybe_ speak to the traditional QA engineer and how he/she can level up their skills by investing in learning how to automate their tests.

### What makes a good test?

Emphasize "Don't test for testing sake".

Think about some speaking points around the value of good tests. Some ideas:

* Speed
* Repeatability
* Regression testing
* And so on...

### What kinds of testing tools are available?

Map some of the common types of testing to specific tools you can use.

Since we're working with a .NET Core app, perhaps use some examples that map to that.

The JTA calls out:

* Security analysis tools - SonarQube, WhiteSource Bolt, Open Web Application Security Project
* Tools for managing security and compliance in the pipeline - blackduck, WhiteSource bolt, veracoda, hp fortify
* Managing and monitoring technical debt - SonarQube, security, style, dependencies, etc.

That said, I think we can also dial it back a bit and talk about some more lightweight tools you can use today.
