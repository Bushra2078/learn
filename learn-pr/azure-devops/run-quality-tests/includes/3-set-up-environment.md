Here we have the learner run a [template](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/) that populates their Azure DevOps account with starter data for this module. It should be in the state where the previous module left off.

* Boards pre-populated with work.
* Pipeline in place and able to accept build requests.
