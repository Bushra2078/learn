erhaps add a feature or change something in the app that causes a test to fail.

Maybe we forgot to run tests before submitting to the pipeline.

See the build fail and the GitHub badge go red.

Review and analyze the failure in Azure Test Plans.

Remediate the failure, starting locally (e.g. Cloud Shell). The remediation might be to fix a bug in the code or to adjust the tests (which may be valid if behavior has changed.)

Push up the change and watch the build go green again.
