Details TBD, but use a tool such as [coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet) to perform code coverage testing.

Perhaps run it locally and then connect it to the build.

See it run and observe what's tested and what's not.

Add a code coverage badge to the GitHub repo.

Finally, consider adding a widget to the dashboard to visualize code coverage over time.
