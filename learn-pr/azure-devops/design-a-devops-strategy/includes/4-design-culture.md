Here are some areas from the Self-Assessment and just one example of a good behavior. Come back and flesh this out.

* How do teams communicate?
* Who makes decisions in the organization?
  * Leadership sets guardrails and communication mechanisms for safe decision-making. Guardrails are reviewed regularly to ensure they continue to foster autonomy and safety
* How does your team collaborate, share risks, innovate, and learn?
  * There is high cooperation among teams. Risks are shared. Failure leads to learning and inquiry to help the team improve. Innovation is encouraged and implemented
* How do teams share knowledge and learnings among themselves?
