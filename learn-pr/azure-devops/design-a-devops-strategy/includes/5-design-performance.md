e.g. measurement

Here are some areas from the Self-Assessment and just one example of a good behavior. Come back and flesh this out.

* How do you measure code quality?
  * We track the density of production incidents and performance back to the code
* What decisions do you make by looking at usage data from your applications?
  * Usage telemetry, A/B test results, and performance data are collected continuously and inform the next experiments that are run in every release
* How do you gather and measure feedback from users?
  * Usage telemetry is gathered with real user monitoring at 100% sampling
