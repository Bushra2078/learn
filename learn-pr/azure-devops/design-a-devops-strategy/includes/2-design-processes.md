Here are some areas from the Self-Assessment and just one example of a good behavior. Come back and flesh this out.

* How do you plan, prioritize and schedule work?
  * We create measurable experiments from hypotheses and use production data to assess results
* Who decides priorities?
  * (Answers " How does your backlog take business impact into account?") - We instrument our software to measure the KPIs, plan work against them and report on a regular cadence
* When do you consider work "done"?
  * Done means we are collecting real-time telemetry on quality of service and usage against new deployments to real users
* What's our release process?
  * Anyone can initiate a release; deployment will gradually be exposed to increasing amounts of production traffic and if there is a problem, it will be remediated
* How does our security and compliance process work?
  * We build security scanning into the release pipeline
* How do development and operations teams collaborate during a production issue? Who has access to your production environments?
  * Developers rotate on-call duty and, when on duty, are paged to participate without delay in troubleshooting live site incidents related to their area of code
  * Production access is limited to automated processes and tokens that last a few hours
