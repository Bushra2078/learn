Here are some areas from the Self-Assessment and just one example of a good behavior. Come back and flesh this out.

* For the application or service you work on, how often does your organization deploy code to production?
  * On demand (multiple deploys per day)
* What is your lead time for changes (i.e., how long does it take to go from "code committed" to "code successfully running in production")?
  * Less than one hour
* How long does it generally take to restore service when a service incident occurs (e.g., unplanned outage, service impairment, etc.)?
  * Less than one hour
* When you deploy a change to the primary application or service you work on, what percentage of the changes result in degraded service or subsequently require remediation?
  * 0%-15%
* How satisfied are you with your job?
  * I am very satisfied with my job and recommend my organization as a good place to work. I have the tools and resources I need, and my job makes good use of my skills and abilities
