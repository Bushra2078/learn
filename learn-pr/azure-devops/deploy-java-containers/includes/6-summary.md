Great work! In this module, you built a release pipeline to deploy a Java web app deployed as a Docker container to Azure via Azure DevOps. The pipeline automatically runs whenever a commit is made to the master branch, builds and pushes the container image, securely deploys to cloud assets, including basic management of a MySQL database.

While this module specifically focused on a Java container app deployed to an Azure App Service, the fundamentals covered apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support even the most sophisticated scenarios.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with Java, which is just one of the many platforms Azure supports natively. To learn about support and tutorials for different developer platforms, see [Build applications with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/developer/?azure-portal=true).

In addition to supporting multiple platforms, Azure also provides a variety of resources that can be used from Java solutions. To learn more about the opportunities for Java on Azure, see [Build and deploy Java apps on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/develop/java/?azure-portal=true)

This module worked with a solution that was deployed as a Docker container. To learn more about working with containers in Azure, see the [Administer containers in Azure learning path](/learn/paths/administer-containers-in-azure/?azure-portal=true).

The application in this module was backed by Azure Database for MySQL. To learn about migrating an on-premises MySQL to Azure Database for MySQL, see the [Migrate on-premises MySQL databases to Azure Database for MySQL module](/learn/modules/migrate-on-premises-mysql-databases/?azure-portal=true).
