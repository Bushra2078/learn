Great work! In this module, you built a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines that deploys a Java web app  as a Docker container to Azure. The pipeline automatically runs whenever you merge a change to the `master` branch of your Git repository on GitHub. The pipeline builds and pushes the container image, securely deploys to cloud assets, and includes basic management of a MySQL database.

While this module specifically focused on a Java container app deployed to Azure App Service, the fundamentals covered apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support your specific requirements.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with Java, which is just one of the many platforms Azure supports natively. To learn about support and tutorials for different developer platforms, see [Build applications with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/developer/?azure-portal=true).

Azure also provides a variety of resources that you can use for Java apps. To learn more about the opportunities for Java on Azure, see [Build and deploy Java apps on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/develop/java/?azure-portal=true).

This module packages a Java app as a Docker container. To learn more about working with containers in Azure, see the [Administer containers in Azure](../../../paths/administer-containers-in-azure/index.yml?azure-portal=true) learning path.

The application in this module connects to Azure Database for MySQL. To learn about migrating an on-premises MySQL installation to Azure Database for MySQL, see the [Migrate on-premises MySQL databases to Azure Database for MySQL](/learn/modules/migrate-on-premises-mysql-databases/?azure-portal=true) module.
