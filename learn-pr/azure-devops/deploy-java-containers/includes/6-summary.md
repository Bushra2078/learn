Great work! In this module, you built a release pipeline to deploy a Python web app using the Django framework to Azure via Azure DevOps. The pipeline automatically runs whenever a commit is made to the master branch, builds and tests the solution, securely deploys to cloud assets, and then validates the deployment using functional tests.

While this module specifically focused on a Python app deployed to an Azure App Service, the fundamentals covered apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support even the most sophisticated scenarios.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with Python, which is just one of the many platforms Azure supports natively. To learn about support and tutorials for different developer platforms, see [Build applications with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/developer/?azure-portal=true).

In addition to supporting multiple platforms, Azure also provides a variety of resources that can be used from Python solutions. For a learning path full of examples on how to use Python with Azure's data analysis and machine learning tools, see [Introduction to machine learning with Python and Azure Notebooks](/learn/paths/intro-to-ml-with-python/?azure-portal=true). You may also be interested in using Python with Azure Cognitive Services, which is covered in [Build an AI web app by using Python and Flask](/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app/?azure-portal=true).

If you are new to Python, check out the learning path [Take your first steps with Python](/learn/paths/python-first-steps/?azure-portal=true). It includes hours of instructional modules like that help you get started with the basics of building Python applications.
