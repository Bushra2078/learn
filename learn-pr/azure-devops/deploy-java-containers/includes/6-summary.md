Congratulations! In this module, you built a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines that deploys a Java web app as a Docker container to Azure App Service. The pipeline automatically runs whenever there's a change to the `main` branch of your Git repository on GitHub. The pipeline builds and pushes the container image, securely deploys to cloud resources, and does basic MySQL database management.

While this module focused on deploying a Java container app to App Service, the fundamentals apply across a wide range of platforms and deployment targets. Azure Pipelines can scale to support your specific requirements.
