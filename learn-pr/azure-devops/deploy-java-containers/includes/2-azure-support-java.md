In this part, you learn some of the ways Azure and Azure DevOps support Java applications.

**Java** is a general purpose programming language that's designed to be flexible in its deployment targets. Java includes strong native support for object-oriented programming. You can use Java to develop applications that scale in size and complexity, which makes it an ideal candidate for modern applications. Learn more at [go.java](https://go.java/?azure-portal=true).

## What is Docker?

**Docker** automates the packaging and deployment of portable, self-sufficient containers. Docker containers can be run anywhere a Docker host is found, whether on a development machine, a departmental server, an enterprise data center, or in the cloud. Azure provides multiple ways to run container-based applications, including in app services or as part of clusters managed with orchestration technologies like Kubernetes. Learn more at [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/?azure-portal=true).

> [!NOTE]
> This module is based on a Java project that is deployed as a Docker container, although its contents should generally apply to non-Docker Java apps and non-Java Docker apps.

## What is Azure Database for MySQL?

The Java app that you deploy here connects to a MySQL database.

**Azure Database for MySQL** is a fully managed MySQL database-as-a-service offering from Microsoft. Whether you're building new applications that target MySQL or migrating legacy applications, Azure Database for MySQL provides the enterprise-ready solution needed for modern applications. To learn more, see [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql/?azure-portal=true).

## Java and Azure

Azure provides first-class support for Java. Developers can take their existing codebase and, in most cases, deploy it to Azure without modification. As far as Azure is concerned, hosting Java solutions is comparable to hosting .NET solutions, assuming that the proper dependencies are configured. Azure also provides the means to configure environment variables for application settings, implying you can continue to load settings and secrets using standard Java mechanisms.

Once deployed to Azure, Java applications can connect to resources within Azure, across VPN connections, and anywhere else accessible from the internet. This includes consuming databases, document stores, and all the other resources and services Java developers rely on to be successful.

## Java and Azure DevOps

Java developers will find a welcoming environment in Azure DevOps, it provides a wide range of features for managing the entire software lifecycle. Developers optionally cherry pick the features desired to make their process as efficient as possible. If you need to build and deploy source code from GitHub or another source control system, Azure Pipelines provides variety of build, test, and deployment tasks for Java apps. Azure Pipelines doesn't provide the specific task that you need, you can provide scripts that fill in the gaps.
