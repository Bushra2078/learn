Azure and Azure DevOps provide first-class support for Java. Through a variety of deployment targets, including App Services, serverless offerings, and container-based deployments, Java developers will find a wealth of opportunities for their solutions in Azure. In addition, Azure DevOps provides a seamless solution for getting your projects built and deployed.  

In this module, you'll walk through the process of creating an automated CI/CD pipeline for a Java application deployed as a Docker container. You'll learn about how a project can begin in GitHub and flow through Azure DevOps in order to build, publish, and deploy a solution to an Azure App Service.

While this module focuses on the core build and deploy jobs, it's important to understand that all of the other features of Azure Pipelines are still available for Java solutions. You can integrate testing, multiple stages, and other tasks just like you would for other scenarios. They're just skipped for this module to keep things focused.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create Azure resources to support a Java solution.
- Create an Azure DevOps pipeline to build, test, and release the solution to Azure.
- Monitor the build, release, and deployment of the project.

## Prerequisites

This module is designed to be self-contained so that you can complete it on its own. However, it is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the broader Azure DevOps platform. There is an extensive series of learning paths available to guide you:

* [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true)
* [Build applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops?azure-portal=true)
* [Deploy applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/deploy-applications-with-azure-devops?azure-portal=true)

This module also assumes you are already familiar with Java, although that is not a requirement for completing the steps involved.
