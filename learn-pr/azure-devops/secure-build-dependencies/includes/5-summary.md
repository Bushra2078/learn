We all strive to deliver quality, secure products to our users. We must be sure that all of our code, including the open source libraries we use, meet standards of security. We all want to avoid any legal problem that might arise with vulnerabilities and with improper open source licensing.

We can shift our security and compliance left so that we can catch potential issues early in the development process by scanning our open source libraries for vulnerabilities and license types. And we can automate this process as part of the build pipeline so that it is done on a regular basis and ensures that our builds are secure.

In this module, you looked at some tools you can use to scan your open source references for known vulnerabilities and licensing types. You scanned the _Space Game_ web project for issues that need to be addressed. And you explored the report, which highlighted some vulnerabilities.

The open standards such as CVE that we discussed in this module are part of the [Security Content Automation Protocol](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol?azure-portal=true) (SCAP).

There are other components to SCAP that you will want to be familiar with. Check out [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol?azure-portal=true) (NIST) for a list of components.
