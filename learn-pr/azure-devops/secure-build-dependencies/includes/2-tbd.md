Here we explain background information you'll need to complete the exercise in the next unit.

I don't have a full list of requirements right now (some will reveal themselves as we explore.) Some themes identified by the JTA are:

* Inspect open source software packages for security and license compliance to align with corporate standards (e.g. GPLv3)
* Configure build pipeline to access package security and license rating (e.g. Black Duck, White Source)
* Set up a build pipeline to inspect package feeds
* InterpretÂ alerts from package security and license rating assessment
* Configure secure access to package feeds

I could envision sections that explain what we mean by security and licence compliance, what types of tooling are available to help you make assessments, and the overall process of how to set up a build pipeline, assess the results, configure alerts, and access package feeds.
