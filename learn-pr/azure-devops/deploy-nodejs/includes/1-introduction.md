Azure and Azure DevOps support development of just about any kind of application, including Node.js. Azure DevOps enables you to build and deploy to just about anywhere. On Azure, you can deploy to a virtual machine, an app service, a serverless solution, or as a container. You can even deploy your application from Azure DevOps to another cloud or on-premises.

In this module, you create an automated CI/CD pipeline for a basic Node.js application. You learn how a project can begin in GitHub and flow through Azure Pipelines to build, publish, and deploy to Azure App Service.

While this module focuses on the core tasks that are required to build and deploy your app, it's important to understand that all of the other features of Azure Pipelines are still available for Node.js applications. You can integrate testing, define multiple stages, and perform other tasks just like you would for your existing applications. We omit these tasks here to keep things focused.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how Azure and Azure DevOps support Node.js applications.
- Create a project in Azure Pipelines that builds and deploys a basic Node.js application to Azure App Service.
- Trigger the pipeline and see your application be built and deployed to Azure.

## Prerequisites

This module is self-contained so that you can complete it on its own. However, we strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with how Azure DevOps works, along with the kinds of deployment environments that are available to you on Azure, such as Azure App Service. If you're new to Azure or Azure DevOps, we have an extensive series of learning paths to help guide you:

* [Build applications with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops/index.yml?azure-portal=true)
* [Deploy applications with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/deploy-applications-with-azure-devops/index.yml?azure-portal=true)
