Great work! In this module, you built a release pipeline to deploy a Node.js solution to Azure via Azure DevOps. The pipeline automatically runs whenever a commit is made to the master branch, builds and tests the solution, and securely deploys to cloud assets.

While this module specifically focused on a Node.js app deployed to an Azure App Service, the fundamentals covered apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support even the most sophisticated scenarios.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with Node.js, which is just one of the many platforms Azure supports natively. To learn about support and tutorials for different developer platforms, see [Build applications with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/developer/?azure-portal=true).

In addition to supporting multiple platforms, Azure also provides a variety of resources that can be used from Node.js solutions. For an example using Visual Studio Code and Azure Cosmos DB, see [Build a Node.js app for Azure Cosmos DB in Visual Studio Code](/learn/modules/build-node-cosmos-app-vscode/?azure-portal=true).
