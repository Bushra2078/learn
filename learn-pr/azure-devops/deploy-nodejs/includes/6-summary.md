Great work! In this module, you built a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines that deploys a Node.js application to Azure. The pipeline automatically runs whenever you merge a change to the `main` branch of your Git repository on GitHub.

While this module specifically focused on a Node.js app deployed to Azure App Service, the fundamentals we cover here apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support your specific requirements.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with Node.js, which is just one of the many platforms Azure supports. To learn about support and tutorials for other development platforms, see [Build applications with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/developer/?azure-portal=true).

In addition to supporting multiple platforms, Azure also provides various resources that can be used from Node.js applications. For an example that uses Visual Studio Code and Azure Cosmos DB, for more information, see [Build a Node.js app for Azure Cosmos DB in Visual Studio Code](/training/modules/build-node-cosmos-app-vscode/?azure-portal=true).
