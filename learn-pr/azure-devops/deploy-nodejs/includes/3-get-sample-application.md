Your first step is to fork the app on GitHub. A *fork* is a copy of a repository. You can make changes to a fork without affecting the original project.

Although you can propose changes to the original project, in this lesson, work with the *NodeJS Hello World* web project without any changes.

## Fork the GitHub repo

1. In a web browser, go to [GitHub](https://github.com), and sign in.

1. Go to the [Node.js](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world) project.

1. Select **Fork**.

## Check your work

Verify that you now have a version of the repository in your GitHub account by checking the URL path in a browser. Your URL should be `https://github.com/{GitHub User}/nodejs-docs-hello-world`.
