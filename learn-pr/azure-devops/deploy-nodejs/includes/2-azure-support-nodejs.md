In this module, explore creating a Node.js API for a bank and learn how Azure and Azure DevOps support Node.js applications.

This module uses a Bank API that's part of the Azure Developer Advocates' [Web Development for Beginners course](https://microsoft.github.io/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/#/?id=web-development-for-beginners-a-curriculum). If you'd like to learn more about the Bank API code, see the [Build a Bank project](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/7-bank-project) that's part of the course.
