## Prepare

In this module, you'll explore creating a Node.js API for a bank and learn how Azure and Azure DevOps support Node.js applications.

This module uses a Bank API that's part of the Azure Developer Advocates' [Web Development for Beginners course](https://microsoft.github.io/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/#/?id=web-development-for-beginners-a-curriculum). If you'd like to learn more about the Bank API code, see the [Build a Bank project](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/7-bank-project) that's part of the course.

Azure provides first-class support for Node.js. This means that you can take an existing Node.js codebase and, in most cases, deploy it directly to Azure without making modifications. You'll practice doing that in this module.

## Setup
