Re-introduce the fictitious team we introduced in the previous learning path.

Maybe one way to position all this is to have the learner imagine THEY are on the team doing this work.

Summarize their existing build workflow. Describe what's painful about it.

Recall the 3 things the team wants to tackle first.

* Release faster (provide iterative value to customers more quickly.)
* Raise the quality bar. (here I'm thinking code quality.)
* Begin deploying to the cloud to achieve better scale while managing costs.

The team begins by moving their existing build process to Azure Pipelines.

[TODO: Consider how we can use the [Azure Pipelines](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines) extension from the GitHub Marketplace. I see that the list of supported languages doesn't include .NET Core.]
