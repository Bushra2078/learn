Talk track:

* Re-introduce the fictitious team we introduced in the previous learning path.
* Summarize their existing build workflow. Describe what's painful about it.
* Recall the 3 things the team wants to tackle first. (I don't think we defined this earlier - go back and do that. We can choose 3 other things if we want to.)
  * Release faster (provide iterative value to customers more quickly.)
  * Raise the quality bar. (here I'm thinking code quality.)
  * Begin deploying to the cloud to achieve better scale while managing costs.
* Alice is having trouble convincing the team that DevOps is the right way to begin improving their processes. So she decides to just go ahead and try repeating their existing build process to Azure Pipelines.

## Prerequisites

To complete this module, you need to install development tools and create a few accounts. These are tasks you only need to perform once.

The software and accounts you set up now will prepare you to complete this and future modules as well as apply what you learned to your own projects.

You can set up everything shown here on a Windows, macOS, or Linux system.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true)
- [.NET Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download?azure-portal=true)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads?azure-portal=true)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join?azure-portal=true)
- An [Azure DevOps account](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true)

If you don't already have an Azure DevOps account, we highly recommend you go through the [Design a DevOps practice](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/design-a-devops-practice?azure-portal=true) learning path before continuing this module. There, you'll:

* Examine your existing processes
* Identify the key benefits of DevOps
* Sign up for your free Azure DevOps account
