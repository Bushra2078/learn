Great work! In this module, we updated a release pipeline to build, publish, and deploy the team's multi-container solution to Azure Kubernetes Service. The team is now well on their way to implementing a broader microservices strategy that will offer increased agility in their development and operations.

While this module specifically focused on orchestrating a collection of Docker containers using Kubernetes, the fundamentals covered apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support even the most sophisticated scenarios.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with a microservices solution using containers. However, there are many ways to implement microservice solutions in Azure using a wide variety of technologies. To learn more, see [Building microservices on Azure](/azure/architecture/microservices/?azure-portal=true).

The microservices solution in this module had been refactored from a larger monolithic application. To learn more about migrating larger applications into smaller services, see [Decompose a monolithic application into a microservices architecture](learn/modules/microservices-architecture/?azure-portal=true).

The microservices solution in this module used a variety of platforms and services, including Docker, Azure Container Registry, and Kubernetes. To learn more about these and related container-centric technologies in Azure, such as Azure Container Instances and App Service, see the [Administer containers in Azure learning path](/learn/paths/administer-containers-in-azure/?azure-portal=true).
