Great work! In this module, we extended a release pipeline to add support for deploying an Azure Function. The single release pipeline now builds a multi-project solution and deploys different components to different cloud targets in Azure.

While this module specifically focused on an App Service and Azure Function, the fundamentals covered apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support even the most sophisticated scenarios.
