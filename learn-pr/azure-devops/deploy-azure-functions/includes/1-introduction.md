In [Create a release pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-release-pipeline?azure-portal=true), you built a basic release pipeline that deployed an ASP.NET Core application to Azure App Service. Although this typical scenario covers the needs of a basic application, modern solutions often require a combination of applications, services, and other components.

One of the unique benefits cloud computing has delivered on is the broad array of *serverless* application options. *Serverless* applications are those where the application's execution and resources are dynamically allocated by the cloud provider as needed. As a result, they are never dependent on, or constrained by, a specific configuration of servers. While these applications still technically run on servers, they drastically simplify the development model by automatically provisioning, scaling, and managing the infrastructure required.

In this module, you'll join the Tailspin Toys web team as they explore one of Azure's core serverless application offerings, Azure Functions. You'll learn about how an Azure Functions project can be added to an existing CI/CD pipeline in order to deploy to both Azure App Service and Azure Functions as part of the same process.

While this module focuses on the core build and deployment tasks, it's important to understand that all of the other features of Azure Pipelines are still available for multi-project and Azure Functions solutions. You can integrate testing, multiple stages, and other tasks just like you would for other scenarios. We omit these details here to help keep things focused.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the benefits of Azure Functions and when to use them
- Extend a basic release pipeline to also deploy an Azure Function app
- Monitor the build, release, and deployment of your project

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression. To follow the progression from the beginning, be sure to first complete these learning paths:

* [Get started with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/evolve-your-devops-practices/index.yml?azure-portal=true)
* [Build applications with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops/index.yml?azure-portal=true)

We also recommend you start at the beginning of this learning path: [Deploy applications with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/deploy-applications-with-azure-devops/index.yml?azure-portal=true). This module picks up where [Create a release pipeline in Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-release-pipeline/?azure-portal=true) leaves off.

[!include[](../../shared/includes/project-details-note.md)]

This module also assumes you have basic familiarity with Azure Functions, although that knowledge is not required to complete it. If you are new to the topic, it is recommended that you complete the [Create serverless applications](../../../paths/create-serverless-applications/index.yml?azure-portal=true) learning path first.

## Meet the team

You met the _Space Game_ web team at Tailspin Toys in previous modules. As a refresher, here's who you'll work with in this module.
