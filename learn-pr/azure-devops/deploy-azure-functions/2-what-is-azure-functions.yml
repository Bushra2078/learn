  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of these projects is a good candidate for serverless computing?"
    choices:
    - content: "A service that recognizes people in images."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Serverless applications are great as gateways to more sophisticated functions, such as cognitive services."
    - content: "A peer-to-peer file sharing network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While peer-to-peer networks operate without the use of a centralized server, this is not the kind of serverless we're talking about here."
    - content: "A service that manages an online shopping cart."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Shopping carts require some sort of state in order to track items, so they are not a good candidate for serverless computing."
  - content: "Which of the following is not a good reason to use Azure Functions?"
    choices:
    - content: "They do not require any special configuration to be massively scalable."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Functions automatically scales based on demand. In fact, you can even specify specialized behavior, such as keeping a certain number of instances warm at all times."
    - content: "They can be written in virtually any mainstream language."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Functions can be developed in C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, PowerShell, and more."
    - content: "They are a replacement for app services and virtual machines."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Functions is great for providing specific services, but are not intended to replace app services or virtual machines."
  - content: "Which of the following is not a supported way to directly trigger an Azure Functions app?"
    choices:
    - content: "Making an HTTP request over the public Internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is one of the most common ways to integrate with Azure Functions."
    - content: "Detecting a new message on a message queue."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a very common way to invoke an Azure Functions app asynchronously."
    - content: "Receiving a carefully filled-out form via fax machine."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "At this time, incoming fax messages are not directly supported. However, there's no reason you couldn't wire up fax software to another trigger method."
