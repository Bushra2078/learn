_Infrastructure as code_ enables you to describe, through code, the infrastructure you need for your application.

Infrastructure as code enables you to maintain both your application code and everything you need to deploy your application in a central code repository that you can build, test, and deploy as a unit.

Tim's called the team together. He has a problem and he knows that the best way to solve it is to discuss it with everyone.

## Weekly meeting

**Andy:** Tim, you had a topic to discuss. What's up?

**Tim:** I have a few things on my mind. We're getting ready to launch _Space Game_ to our preview users, which means that the website needs to be ready as well. Irwin wants us to expand our operations so that the website is scaled geographically. Geographic scaling means better response times for users and makes us more competitive.

Irwin added a few more requirements:

* The game development team has a number of back-end systems that perform in-game matchmaking, collect leaderboard data, and so on. These systems are virtual machines that run on Azure. We need the ability to scale out these systems to accommodate any number of active users playing the game. Each system needs to come up quickly and be configured identically.
* Our security officer is running an audit on our systems. They require that we adhere not only to application security requirements, but a number of infrastructure security requirements.
* Currently, we deploy one Azure SQL Database that connects to each of our _Dev_, _Test_, and _Staging_ environments. We need each environment to have its own database server so that we can test and roll out changes incrementally. A change made in _Dev_ might break other environments such as _Test_ and _Staging_ until that change reaches those stages.

All this means that there's a lot more infrastructure to manage. I'm just one person and we don't plan on hiring others to help. I honestly don't know what to do. I know that some of these issues, like our back-end systems, aren't your problem, but I'd appreciate the help.

**Andy:** Okay, from what I'm hearing, you need a way to:

* Automatically provision Azure App Service environments and database servers that run the _Space Game_ website.
* Configure multiple systems in the exact same way, and keep them configured that way.
* Prove that all the production sites are compliant with various regulations.

From these, I see one common theme: the need to automate your deployments. Is that fair?

**Tim:** Sounds right.

**Andy:** Okay, Tim. Why don't you and I put our heads together after the meeting and then we'll let the rest of the team know what we came up with?

**Mara:** It sounds like you two are on this. But before we end the meeting, let's capture these tasks as part of our upcoming sprint plan.

## The sprint plan

The team does some more brainstorming. As they do every few weeks, they come up with the tasks they need to perform in the next sprint. For the issues Tim raised, they come up with these four tasks:

- **Scale out the website**
- **Configure virtual machines**
- **Scan for security and compliance**
- **Provision a database server for each environment**

**Mara:** If that seems right, I'll add these tasks to Azure Boards.

The team agrees. Mara sets up a sprint iteration and adds these tasks:

![Azure Boards showing the tasks for this sprint](../../shared/media/automate-all-tasks.png)

Each of these tasks relates to what you'll do in this and the following modules. You don't need to add these tasks to Azure Boards now. You'll run a template that populates Azure Boards with these tasks, just as you did in previous modules.

## Express infrastructure as code to automate your deployments

Tim and Andy are sitting at the coffee shop. Andy, who has had three espressos, talks while scribbling on napkins.

**Andy:** The answer to all your problems is *infrastructure as code*.

**Tim:** Oh, well, that was simple. You'll have to tell me more!

**Andy:** Okay, when something goes wrong with a server, what do you do?

**Tim:** I SSH in and fix it. I've also got a lot of Bash scripts that I've written over the years, although they're not exactly organized.

**Andy:** Right, I believe I've seen many of them taped to the walls in your office.

Tim shrugs.

**Andy:** Infrastructure as code, which is sometimes called IaC, uses automation to manage infrastructure. For example, instead of configuring your servers one at a time, you use a tool to configure them all of them at once. You express the infrastructure you need for your application as code, such as a configuration file or a script.

Here's a short video where Abel Wang, Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, explains the concepts of infrastructure as code.

**Ask Abel**

> [!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/One-Dev-Minute/What-is-Infrastructure-as-Code--One-Dev-Question/player?format=ny]

When you need to change something, like a firewall setting, you update the configuration file and run it one time to update all of the servers. You can see why this makes scaling out a lot easier.

For the _Space Game_ website, we started by bringing up App Service environments manually through the Azure portal. Then we moved to using the Azure CLI in Azure Cloud Shell to accomplish the same thing, but in a more consistent and predicable way. To take the next step, which automates the process even further, we can run the provisioning process through Azure Pipelines.

As a bonus, your infrastructure and configuration code gets stored in version control, along with the application code. You'll have lots more wall space.

As you move to infrastructure as code, you're going to see a lot of improvements.

Infrastructure as code is a best practice in DevOps because it helps bring teams together. The development team gets a better understanding of where their code is being deployed to and run. Operations teams get involved in the process much earlier and can use infrastructure choices to help developers make the right design decisions.

**Andy:** You have a lot on your plate. I think the best way to get started is for us to find a way to scale out the website. You can then apply what you've learned to your other problems.

**Tim:** Sounds great. But I have one question first. You mentioned that we can run the provisioning process through Azure Pipelines. Won't the process recreate our existing environments? I don't think we would want that.

**Andy:** They key here is *idempotency*.

## What is idempotency?

_Idempotency_ is a term that's used in both mathematics and in computer science.

An idempotent operation is one that provides the same result each time you apply it.

Consider the Azure CLI as an example. The following `az group create` command creates an Azure resource group that's named **my-rg** in the **westus** region.

```azurecli
az group create --name my-rg --location westus
```

The command produces output similar to this:

```output
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-rg",
  "location": "westus",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "my-rg",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```

If you run this command a second time, you receive the exact same output. You do not receive an error or a duplicate resource group. That's because this Azure CLI command was designed to be idempotent.

### What if an operation isn't idempotent?

Of course, not all operations are idempotent. For example, say you have a Bash script that creates a directory to hold service logs.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir /var/log/my-service
```

This script creates the */var/log/my-service* directory the first time you run it.

But when you run the script for the second time, you get an error message:

```output
mkdir: /var/log/my-service: File exists
```

Because the `mkdir` command failed, the script produces a non-zero status code, which can indicate a failure to another process.

When an operation isn't idempotent, you can use a condition to make it behave like one. Here's an example that uses the **if..then** syntax to create the directory, but only if that directory does not exist.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -d "/var/log/my-service" ]
then
  mkdir /var/log/my-service
fi
```

## What is imperative vs. declarative code?

Generally speaking, _imperative_ code defines both _what_ the program should accomplish as well as _how_ to achieve the result.

In contrast, _declarative_ code defines what the program should accomplish but does _not_ define how to achieve the result.

Think about how you write code in languages like Python, C#, or Java. Each of these languages are imperative. You use variables, conditional statements, and loops to control the state of your program and express the steps you need.

Compare these languages to HTML, which is declarative. HTML describes _what_ elements appear on the page, but it doesn't describe _how_ to display them. The "how" is the web browser's responsibility.

When relating imperative and declarative code to infrastructure, consider a few examples. This example shows a Bash script that creates an Azure resource group, an App Service plan, and an App Service instance that uses that plan.

[!code-bash[](code/2-create-appservice-1.sh)]

Here, you have full control over the order of each step and how to run each command. Compare this to the following Terraform plan, which accomplishes the same task (you'll learn more about Terraform shortly.)

[!code-terraform[](code/2-main-1.tf)]

This code is written in HCL, a declarative language that supports Terraform. Here, you have less control over the order of each step or how Terraform accomplishes each step. The advantage is that you need only to specify the infrastructure you want; Terraform figures out the details.

### Which approach is better?

When considering an imperative versus a declarative approach to your infrastructure, rather than focusing on which approach is better, consider the tools you can use. Choose the tool that matches your skills and best meets your needs.

Some prefer an imperative approach because it gives you fuller control over how your infrastructure is managed. But consider the Bash script you saw earlier. Say you want to modify the resource group's location from "westus" to "northeurope".

[!code-bash[](code/2-create-appservice-2.sh?highlight=6)]

When you run this Bash script, you get an error that says that the resource group already exists in another location.

```output
Invalid resource group location 'northeurope'. The Resource group already exists in location 'westus'.
```

To fix this error, you might first delete the existing resource group and then run the Bash script a second time to create a new set of resources. Or you could run the `az resource move` command to move the existing resources within that resource group to the new location.

In the corresponding Terraform plan, Terraform creates a dependency graph for all the resources you describe, creating an overall description of what you're building. In doing so, Terraform can often adjust your resources to match your desired state.

[!code-terraform[](code/2-main-2.tf?highlight=3,8,21)]

In this case, Terraform must recreate the resource group because you can't reassign a resource group's location. Terraform must also recreate the App Service plan and the App Service instance because it understands that they depend on the resource group. However, Terraform takes care of these details for you. All you needed to do was define your requirements.

## What tools can I use?

**Tim:** Infrastructure as code sounds like something that can answer many of my problems. But I'll need to try it out. What tools can you use to apply infrastructure code?

**Andy:** As you'd expect, there are many options. Some are from Microsoft and are designed for Azure but there are third-party options, too.

_Andy writes down a few options on a napkin._

* Azure CLI
* Azure PowerShell
* Azure Resource Manager templates
* Ansible
* Terraform

### Azure CLI

The Azure command-line interface (CLI) is a command line program that enables you to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources. Like other CLI tools, you can run CLI commands directly from a terminal or you can add commands to a Bash script or a PowerShell script. The Azure CLI runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux, or you can access it from Cloud Shell.

Here's a basic example that uses the `az group create` command to create an Azure resource group named "my-rg" in the "westus" location.

```azurecli
az group create \
  --name my-rg \
  --location westus
```

### Azure PowerShell

Azure PowerShell is a module that you add to Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core to enable you to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources. Azure PowerShell requires PowerShell to function. PowerShell provides services like the shell window, command parsing, and so on. Azure PowerShell adds the Azure-specific commands.

Here's a basic example that uses the `New-AzResourceGroup` cmdlet to create an Azure resource group that's named "my-rg" in the "West US" location.

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroup `
  -Name my-rg `
  -Location "West US"
```

Azure PowerShell is also available two ways: inside a browser via the Cloud Shell or locally on Windows, macOS, or Linux. In both cases, you have two modes to choose from. You can use it in interactive mode, in which you manually issue one command at a time, or in scripting mode, where you execute a script that consists of multiple commands.

The Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell are roughly equal in terms of what each can do. When deciding between the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell, choose the one that best fits your team's skills. For example, if you use PowerShell to administer Windows, you'll quickly become comfortable using Azure PowerShell. If you write Bash scripts to administer Linux, you might prefer the Azure CLI.

### Azure Resource Manager templates

_Azure Resource Manager_ is the interface for managing and organizing cloud resources. Think of Resource Manager as a way to deploy cloud resources.

If you're familiar with Azure resource groups, you know that they enable you to treat sets of related resources as a single unit. Resource Manager is what organizes the resource groups that let you deploy, manage, and delete all of the resources together in a single action.

A Resource Manager _template_ precisely defines all the Resource Manager resources in a deployment. You can deploy a Resource Manager template into a resource group as a single operation.

A Resource Manager template is a JSON file, making it a form of declarative automation. Here's a basic example that defines an Azure resource group named "my-rg" in the "westus" location.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2018-05-01/subscriptionDeploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.1",
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups",
      "apiVersion": "2018-05-01",
      "location": "westus",
      "name": "my-rg",
      "properties": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

You can run this template from Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or from application code through a REST service or API.

> [!NOTE]
> You may hear others refer to Resource Manager templates as "ARM templates". We prefer the full names "Azure Resource Manager templates" or "Resource Manager templates".

### Ansible

Ansible is an open-source product, sponsored by Red Hat, that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, and application deployments. You can use Ansible to provision Azure resources such as virtual machines, containers, networks, and even complete cloud infrastructures. You can also use Ansible to configure your Azure resources after they're provisioned.

In addition to Azure, Ansible supports other public clouds and private cloud frameworks.

You can run Ansible commands directly, or you can write _playbooks_ to deploy more complex configurations. A playbook is a YAML file, making it a form of declarative automation. Here's a basic example that defines an Azure resource group named "my-rg" in the "westus" location.

```yml
- name: Example configuration
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:
  - name: Create resource group
    azure_rm_resourcegroup:
      name: my-rg
      location: westus
```

You use the `ansible-playbook` command to apply this configuration.

### Terraform

Terraform, by HashiCorp, is an open-source tool that provisions and manages cloud infrastructure. Terraform's command-line interface provides you with a simple way to provision Azure resources such as virtual machines, containers, and networks. Terraform generates an execution plan that describes what it will do to reach the desired state. You can review this execution plan and then run the plan to apply the configuration. As your configuration changes, Terraform determines what changed and creates incremental execution plans to update only what's necessary.

In addition to Azure, Terraform supports other public clouds and private cloud frameworks.

You typically write Terraform code in a language called Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL). However, you can also express your Terraform configuration using JSON. HCL and JSON are forms of declarative automation. Here's a basic example written in HCL that defines an Azure resource group named "my-rg" in the "westus" location.

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "my" {
  name     = "my-rg"
  location = "westus"
}
```

## Where can I run my infrastructure code?

You can run your infrastructure code from:

* A terminal window or PowerShell
* Cloud Shell
* A CI/CD pipeline, including Azure Pipelines

As with any kind of code, writing infrastructure code can be an iterative process. As you test out new ideas, you might need to bring up and tear down your configurations multiple times. For more complex configurations, you might define your infrastructure in smaller pieces, and then fit those pieces together to form your complete cloud infrastructure.

During the development phase, you typically run your infrastructure code directly from a terminal window or Cloud Shell. Visual Studio Code provides add-ins that help you write configuration code. You can run your configuration code from Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal. Cloud Shell is also a popular choice because it comes with everything you need to run any of the options we discussed here: Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates, Ansible, and Terraform.

Once you have the working configuration that you need, you typically check in your infrastructure code to source control along with your application code. This enables you to version, build, test, and deploy your applications as a unit.

Because your infrastructure code is maintained along with your application code, you can run your infrastructure code in the pipeline. You might configure the pipeline to apply your infrastructure code after it builds the application, but before you deploy your application to a running environment.

In this module, you first apply a Terraform plan from Cloud Shell to see it working. Then you run it from Azure Pipelines to provision infrastructure for your web application.

## The decision

Andy sits back in his chair.

**Andy:** Tim, of these options, which tool feels like the right choice to start with?

**Tim:** Each option is appealing. I'm a Linux user, so running Azure CLI commands or Resource Manager templates through Bash scripts most closely matches my skills. But remember that we operate a number of services on-premises that power our game servers and payment systems. Until we migrate these systems to the cloud, we still need to provision and configure those systems. Terraform enables us to do that.

**Andy:** Great idea. You're always forward-looking. If you like Terraform, you can use it to provision systems in our datacenter as well. Then, as we migrate to the cloud, you can modify the infrastructure code to provision cloud resources because you already know the language and the infrastructure requirements.

**Andy:** Let's work together on this one. You can take the lead. Let me just grab one more coffee to go.
