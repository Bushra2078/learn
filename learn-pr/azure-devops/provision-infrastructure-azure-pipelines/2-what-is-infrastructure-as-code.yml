  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Say you've written infrastructure code to automatically provision cloud resources for your application. Where's the best place to store your code?"
    choices:
    - content: "On a network share."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can store your infrastructure code on a network share, is there a way that enables you to version and treat your infrastructure code like you would any other code?"
    - content: "In source control, along with your application sources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Storing your infrastructure code along with your application sources enables you to version, build, test, and deploy your applications as a unit."
    - content: "In source control, in its own repository."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can store your infrastructure code in its own repository, is there a way that enables you to version, build, test, and deploy your applications as a unit?"
  - content: "Which of the following operations is not idempotent?"
    choices:
    - content: "Defining an Azure SQL database in a Resource Manager template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A Resource Manager template creates your resource only when needed, making it an idempotent operation."
    - content: "From a PowerShell script, using an `If` statement to add a firewall rule only when that rule does not exist."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using conditional statements, such as `If`, enables you to make any operation behave like an idempotent one."
    - content: "From a Bash script, appending a database server's IP address to the */etc/hosts* file."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Although it might be safe to add the same IP address multiple times to the */etc/hosts* file, you might need to manually clean up this file if, say, the IP address changes."
