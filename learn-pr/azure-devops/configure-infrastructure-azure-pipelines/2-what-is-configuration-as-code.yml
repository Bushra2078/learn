  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How does configuration as code differ from infrastructure as code?"
    choices:
    - content: "They both refer to the same concept."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although these concepts are simlar, they focus on different aspects of systems automation."
    - content: "Infrastructure as code uses imperative code. Configuration as code uses declarative code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Infrastructure as code and configuration as code frameworks can both be imperative or declarative."
    - content: "Infrastructure as code refers to the automated provisioning of infrastructure. Configuration as code refers to automating how software is configured within your infrastructure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can combine the two models to automatically provision and then configure your systems all in one step."
  - content: "A co-worker manually installs a security patch on some, but not all, of the web servers in your deployment. This is likely an example of:"
    choices:
    - content: "Configuration drift"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Configuration drift happens when resources change over time from their original deployment state. This is caused by changes made by people, processes, or programs and can happen manually or through automated processes."
    - content: "Configuration management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Configuration management refers to the automated management of configuration, and not manual processes."
    - content: "Idempotency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An idempotent operation is one that provides the same result each time you apply it. How might manual patching affect the consistency among your servers?"
  - content: "Which of the following is an example of a _node_?"
    choices:
    - content: "A virtual machine in your network that runs payment processing software."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A virtual machine that runs business-critical applications is a good example of a _node_, or system you would likely manage through automation."
    - content: "The central configuration server that holds your configuration code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A _node_ refers to any system under management. A central configuration server helps you manage nodes."
