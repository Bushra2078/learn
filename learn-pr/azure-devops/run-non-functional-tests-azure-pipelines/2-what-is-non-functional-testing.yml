  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You recently connected your webapp to a database. Database records are shown when the page loads. You want to verify that database calls don't cause the page to take over one second to load. Which kind of non-functional testing might you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Load testing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Load tests determine the performance of an application under realistic loads. If loading the page causes your load tests to fail, you might then test the performance of the database directly to help diagnose the bottleneck."
    - content: "Stress testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Stress testing releates more to testing an application under extremely heavy loads that go beyond what's specified for the application."
    - content: "Compliance testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Compliance testing relates more to ensuring your application is compliant with some set of requirements, such as HIPAA."
  - content: "Your website sells concert tickets for a local venue. The venue is hosting a multi-day event that includes many popular performers. You're nervous that the site will not be able to handle the sudden surge in traffic. What kind of testing might help ease your mind?"
    choices:
    - content: "Load testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Load testing relates more to the performance of an application under normal, realistic loads."
    - content: "Stress testing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Stress testing places an application under extremely heavy loads that go beyond what's specified for the application. You can run stress tests over a period of time to measure how your website handles the spike in traffic."
    - content: "Penetration testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Penetration testing releates more to verifying whether your application or service exposes vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit."
  - content: "You suspect that your website exposes a vulnerability that would allow a hacker to access sensitive data. Which kind of non-functional testing might you run to discover this vulnerability?"
    choices:
    - content: "Penetration testing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Penetration testing, or pen testing, involves an authorized, simulated cyber attack to see if there are vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit."
    - content: "Compliance testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Compliance testing relates more to ensuring your application is compliant with some set of requirements, such as HIPAA."
    - content: "Stress testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Stress testing releates more to testing an application under extremely heavy loads that go beyond what's specified for the application."
