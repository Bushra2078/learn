In this part, you'll make sure that your Azure DevOps organization is set up to complete the rest of this module.

The modules in this learning path form a progression, where you follow the Tailspin web team through their DevOps journey.

This learning path also builds on the [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true) learning path. There, you set up your Azure DevOps organization and created a task backlog on Azure Boards using the Basic process.

## Run the template

At this point, you have two options:

1. Continue with the Azure DevOps project you created in the _Evolve your DevOps practices_ learning path.
1. Run a template that sets up everything for you in your Azure DevOps organization.

You can continue using your existing project if you completed the previous modules and have the Tailspin project set up in Azure DevOps. Run the template if you don't have the project set up or want to repeat this module from a fresh environment.

<!-- TODO: Update URL with prod -->

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Run the template](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator-mslearn.azurewebsites.net/?name=run-quality-tests&azure-portal=true)

From the Azure DevOps Demo Generator site, perform these steps to run the template.

1. Click **Sign In** and accept the usage terms.
1. From the **Create New Project** page, select your Azure DevOps organization and enter a project name, such as **Space Game - web - Tests**.
1. Select **Fork repository on GitHub** and then click **Authorize**. If a window appears, authorize access to your GitHub account.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You need to select this option for the template to connect to your GitHub repository. Select this option even if you've already forked the _Space Game_ web site project. The template uses your existing fork.
1. Click **Create Project**.

    ![Creating a project through the Azure DevOps Demo Generator](../media/3-create-new-project.png)

    It takes a few moments for the template to run.
1. Click **Navigate to project** to go to your project in Azure DevOps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Clean up your Azure DevOps environment](/learn/modules/run-quality-tests-build-pipeline/8-clean-up-environment?azure-portal=true) page in this module contains important cleanup steps. Cleaning up helps ensure that you don't run out of free build minutes. Be sure to perform the cleanup steps even if you don't complete this module.

## Move the work item to Doing

In this part, you'll assign a work item to yourself that relates to this module on Azure Boards. You'll also move the work item to the **Doing** state. In practice, you and your team would assign work items at the start of each Sprint, or work iteration.

Assigning work in this way gives you a checklist to work from. It gives others on your team visibility into what you're working on and how much work is left. It also helps the team enforce Work in Progress, or WIP, limits so that the team doesn't take on too much work at one time.

Recall that the team settled on these seven top issues.

![Backlog of tasks](../../shared/media/build-all-tasks.png)

Here you'll move the third item, **Create unit tests** to the **Doing** column and assign yourself to the work item.

Recall that **Create unit tests** relates to running unit tests during the build so that fewer regression bugs so that Amita doesn't have to deal with so many regression bugs when she tests out new builds.

![Work item details](../media/3-work-item-details.png)

To set up the work item:

1. From Azure DevOps, navigate to **Boards** and then select **Boards** from the menu.

    ![Azure DevOps showing the Boards menu](../../shared/media/azure-devops-boards-menu.png)

1. From the **Create unit tests** work item, click the down arrow at the bottom of the card. Then assign the work item to yourself.

1. Move the work item from the **To Do** to the **Doing** column.

    ![Azure Boards showing the card in the Doing column](../media/3-azure-boards-wi3-doing.png)

At the end of this module, you'll move the card to the **Done** column after you've completed the task.
