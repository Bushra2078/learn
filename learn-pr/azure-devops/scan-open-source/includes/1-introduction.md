In this module, you'll scan open-source components for security vulnerabilities and assess their license ratings.

It's important to have an inventory of the open-source components that your project uses. It's important to understand which libraries have vulnerability issues, when those vulnerabilities were addressed, and what versions you can use. Based on this information, you might even choose to use a different library or write your own.

You also need to understand what licenses these libraries use. Some licenses require you to make public any code that uses that library if you've made changes to the library's code. This requirement is problematic when your source code is not open source as well. You'll need to check with your own legal team to determine which licenses you can use.

In this module, you'll use WhiteSource Bolt, by WhiteSource, to scan open-source components for known vulnerabilities and license ratings.

In this module, you will:

* Learn which tools you can use to inspect open-source software packages for security and license ratings
* Access package and license ratings for open-source components by using WhiteSource Bolt
* Analyze the results of the scan so you can take the appropriate action

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression.

To follow the progression from the beginning, be sure to first complete the [Evolve your DevOps practices](../../../paths/evolve-your-devops-practices/index.yml?azure-portal=true) learning path.

We also recommend you start at the beginning of this learning path, [Build applications with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops/index.yml?azure-portal=true).

If you want to go through just this module, you need to set up a development environment on your Windows, macOS, or Linux system. You need:

* An [Azure DevOps organization](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true)
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/join?azure-portal=true) account
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true)
* [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1?azure-portal=true)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads?azure-portal=true)

You can get started with Microsoft Azure DevOps for free.

This environment lets you complete the exercises in this and future modules. You can also use it to apply your new skills to your own projects.
