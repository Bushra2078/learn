In [Create a release management workflow](/learn/modules/create-a-release-management-workflow?azure-portal=true), you helped the Tailspin web team as they design and build a release management workflow. This workflow enables the team to move changes through each of the various stages, such as testing and staging, all the way out to a production environment that's available to your users.

Recall that in the test stage, Amita tests the web application manually  as she always did. When she's satisfied, she manually promotes the application to the pre-production stage, where management can 

In [Run quality tests in your build pipeline using Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/run-quality-tests-build-pipeline?azure-portal=true), you ran unit and code coverage tests during the build process to help ensure that only high-quality [XYZ], and to help make sure you didn't break anything along the way. But what kinds of tests do you run once the service is operational?

In this module, you'll learn how to add functional and non-functional testing to your [test plan]. Along the way, you'll help Amita map her manual test practices to automated UI tests to [help things go faster.] (Talk about how she'll be writing code?)

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- A
- B
- C

## Prerequisites

TODO: Update

TODO: Also talk about how you need your own Azure sub and how to set one up :/

The prerequisites are the same as the [Create a build pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-a-build-pipeline?azure-portal=true) module.

Make sure you have the _Space Game_ project loaded in Visual Studio Code and your _Space Game_ project on GitHub handy.

## Meet the team

You met the _Space Game_ web team at Tailspin Toys in previous modules. As a refresher, here's who you'll work with in this module.
