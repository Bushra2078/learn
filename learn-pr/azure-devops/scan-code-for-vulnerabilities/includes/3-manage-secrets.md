Here we discuss managing secrets. This unit focuses on surveying the options and making a recommendation. The JTA calls out these areas:

* Azure Key Vault
* HashiCorp Vault
* AppCenter (mobile apps)
* Apple portal, including iOS signing certificates
* AKS

(How do we position HashiCorp Vault against Azure Key Vault?)

(I'm currently thinking we limit our discussion specifically around mobile apps (AppCenter & Apple portal in the above list). I could see this being its own learning path at some point. But maybe it's OK to at least mention here...)

(Re: AKS - again, this will be its own learning path, so maybe cut)
