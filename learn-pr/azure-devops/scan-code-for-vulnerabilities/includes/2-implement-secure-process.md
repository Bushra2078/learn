Describe the value of including security and compliance scanning against the codebase as part of your development process.

Discuss how these can fit into your pipeline (local dev, CI).

Discuss some of the options you have when implementing a code analysis security workflow:

* Visual Studio Code Analysis
* Roslyn Security Analyzers (perhaps focus on this more than the former bullet because it looks like [it will eventually replace it](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-quality/roslyn-analyzers-overview?view=vs-2017#roslyn-analyzers-vs-static-code-analysis).)
* OWASP
* SonarQube
