The ultimate goal of DevOps is to increase the speed and quality of software services, something every IT organization needs. But how can DevOps teams accelerate delivery if they don't understand what they deliver or who their customers are? Despite advancements in delivery methods, quality service still begins with understanding the needs of customers.

Dissatisfied customers can cost you money. The first step to overcoming this is to admit that you have room for improvement. The second step is to measure customer satisfaction to find out where you currently stand.

Engaging customers throughout your product lifecycle is a primary Agile principle. They key is to empower each team to interact directly with customers on the feature sets they own.

TODO In this module, 

- Continuous feedback: Build in customer feedback loops. These can take many forms:
  - Customer voice: Make it easy for customers to give feedback, add ideas, and vote on next generation features.
  - Product feedback: In-product feedback buttons are another way to solicit feedback about the product experience or specific features.
  - Customer demos: Regularly scheduled demos that solicit feedback from your customers can help shape next generation products and keep you on track to build applications your customers want to consume.
- Early adopter programs: Such programs should be developed with the idea that all teams may want to participate as some point. Early adopters gain access to early versions of working software which they then can provide feedback. Oftentimes, these programs work by turning select feature flags on for an early adopter list.
- Data-driven decisions: Find ways to instrument your product to obtain useful data and that can test various hypotheses. Help drive to an experiment-friendly culture that celebrates learning.
