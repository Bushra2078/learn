      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It is true that the binary that is created at the end of an Azure Pipeline is called an _artifact_, but Azure Artifacts is a repository in your Azure DevOps organization where you can manage the dependencies for your codebase."
    - content: "Azure Artifacts is a repository in your Azure DevOps organization where you can manage the dependencies for your codebase."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Artifacts allows you to create your own package feeds in your Azure DevOps organization where you can manage the dependencies for your codebase."
    - content: "Azure Artifacts is a repository in your Azure DevOps organization where you store old code that is no longer in use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you could have old packages that no one uses in your Azure Artifacts repository, Azure Artifacts is a repository in your Azure DevOps organization where you can manage the dependencies for your codebase."
