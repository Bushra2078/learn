With the proof of concept a success and monitoring in place, the team is once again excited to see what this pipeline can do. Everyone begins talking at once again and there are a lot of questions being thrown at Andy and Mara. 

Andy glances at Mara and clears his throat.

**Andy:** Hold on. We need to step back and think about this in terms of our new Agile approach to things. We finished our last sprint when we created our Boards and Azure Pipeline for the builds. We need to set up CD as our next sprint and a clear picture of where we want to go with this. You know, get some tasks in place.

**Amita:** Andy is right. Irwin asked us to find a way to speed up deployments. I think that should be the focus of the next sprint. Remember our Value Stream Map? We still have a few slow areas.

See? we are still slow at running quality tests.

**Tim:** Exactly. And we are still bottle-necked at getting management to approve new features and getting changes out to production.

The team talks and brainstorms a bit.

**Mara:** Great. Then we can start planning what tasks we will accomplish in this sprint. It sounds to me like we need:

- **Define a release management workflow**
- **Automate quality tests**
- **Improve release cadence**

If we all agree, I will put these tasks in our Board.
