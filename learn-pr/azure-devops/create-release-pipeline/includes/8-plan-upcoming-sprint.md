Notes:

- Show a team conversation where things are getting wild - there are many questions and everyone has a viewpoint.
- Someone reminds the room about Irwin asking for them to move faster.
- Amita mentions the VSM they set up previously and they call out what's still slow. Specifically, she calls out running quality tests.
  - Then Tim mentions these things that are still slow:
    - Getting management to approve new features
    - Getting changes out to production
- Amita mentions that sprint iteration 1 is complete. This is the iteration where they focused on the build pipeline (LP2).
  - Perhaps call out why it was successful. It gave them a checklist of tasks and goals. (horrible wording)
- Amita suggests that they plan their next sprint. Creating a sprint will give them a plan they can share with Irwin and a checklist.
- They talk and brainstorm a bit (perhaps show the [whiteboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/choose-an-agile-approach/3-what-is-azure-boards) again?) 
- The finalize on a plan. Show screenshot of Azure Boards. Feature to show:
  - The sprint iteration (show that it's iteration 2)
  - The 3 tasks, all in To Do.
- Here are the tasks:
  - **Define a release management workflow**
  - **Automate quality tests**
  - **Improve release cadence**
- Tell the learner these are the tasks they'll work with in the following modules.
