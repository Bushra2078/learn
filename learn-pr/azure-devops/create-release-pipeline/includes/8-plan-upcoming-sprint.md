Notes:

- Show a team conversation where things are getting wild - there are many questions and everyone has a viewpoint.
- Someone reminds the room about Irwin asking for them to move faster.
- Amita mentions the VSM they set up previously and they call out what's still slow. Specifically, she calls out running quality tests.
  - Then Tim mentions these things that are still slow:
    - Getting management to approve new features
    - Getting changes out to production
- Amita mentions that sprint iteration 1 is complete. This is the iteration where they focused on the build pipeline (LP2).
  - Perhaps call out why it was successful. It gave them a checklist of tasks and goals. (horrible wording)
- Amita suggests that they plan their next sprint. Creating a sprint will give them a plan they can share with Irwin and a checklist.
- They talk and brainstorm a bit (perhaps show the [whiteboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/choose-an-agile-approach/3-what-is-azure-boards) again?) 
- The finalize on a plan. Show screenshot of Azure Boards. Feature to show:
  - The sprint iteration (show that it's iteration 2)
  - The 3 tasks, all in To Do.
- Here are the tasks:
  - **Define a release management workflow**
  - **Automate quality tests**
  - **Improve release cadence**
- Tell the learner these are the tasks they'll work with in the following modules.

With the proof of concept a success and monitoring in place, the team is once again excited to see what this pipeline can do. Everyone begins talking at once again and there are a lot of questions being thrown at Andy and Mara. 

Andy glances at Mara and clears his throat.

**Andy:** Hold on. We need to step back and think about this in terms of our new Agile approach to things. We finished our last sprint when we created our Boards and Azure Pipeline for the builds. We need to set up CD as our next sprint and a clear picture of where we want to go with this. You know, get some tasks in place.

**Amita:** Andy is right. Irwin asked us to find a way to speed up deployments. I think that should be the focus of the next sprint. Remember our Value Stream Map? We still have a few slow areas.

See? we are still slow at running quality tests.

**Tim:** Exactly. And we are still bottle-necked at getting management to approve new features and getting changes out to production.

The team talks and brainstorms a bit.

**Mara:** Great. Then we can start planning what tasks we will accomplish in this sprint. It sounds to me like we need:

- **Define a release management workflow**
- **Automate quality tests**
- **Improve release cadence**

If we all agree, I will put these tasks in our Board.

> These tasks align with what you will do in the next three modules. In each module, you will move the corresponding task to **Doing** and then to **Done** when the task is complete.
