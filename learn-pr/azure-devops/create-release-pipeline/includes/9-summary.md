Great work. You've successfully deployed the _Space Game_ website to Azure App Service by using Azure Pipelines. If you've gone through the [Build applications with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops/index.yml?azure-portal=true) learning path, you know you've taken a big step. You now have a live environment! Take advantage of it and run additional tests or make it available to your users.

Continuous delivery helps you release reliable software updates to your customers as rapidly as the business demands. Your customers can have the latest features and fixes as soon as you're ready to release them. By using the analytics provided by Azure Pipelines, your team can pinpoint hot spots and areas for improvement.

Setting up Azure Pipelines to publish the _Space Game_ website to App Service is a great first step for the team. But this accomplishment is just the beginning. In the modules that follow, you help the team expand their release pipeline to include additional stages and tests. Each improvement to the pipeline will give the team more confidence in the quality of their releases.

## Learn more

Here are some additional resources you can use to learn more about Azure resources, App Service, and many other topics.

### Choose the right compute option for your app

In this module, you deployed a website to App Service. You can use Azure Pipelines to deploy to just about any kind of environment, including a virtual machine or containerized environment.

The [Explore Azure compute services](/learn/modules/azure-compute-fundamentals/?azure-portal=true) module goes into further detail about the kinds of compute options Azure provides.

You'll work more with App Service in the modules that follow. You can also learn about App Service in the [Deploy a website to Azure with Azure App Service](../../../paths/deploy-a-website-with-azure-app-service/index.yml?azure-portal=true) learning path.
