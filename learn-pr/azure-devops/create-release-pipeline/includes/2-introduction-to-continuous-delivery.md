The team is having a meeting over coffee. Irwin, the product manager, has told them they need to start releasing new versions of the web site faster and he's left it up to them to figure out how to do it.

Andy says, "So, as I told Irwin just before he ran off, I think it's time to build a CD pipeline. Automation is the only way to release faster." Mara nods.

Amita and Tim look unhappy. Tim says, "I don't really know what CD is, but if it means losing control of my production environment, I won't do it." 

Amita says, "If it means all the tests are automated, what am I supposed to do? It's not just my job. I don't think we should sacrifice the user experience just to meet some arbitrary deadline." She starts crumbling her scone into little pieces.

Andy replies. "Tim, you won't and Amita, you're right. Let's talk a bit about what continuous delivery (CD) is so we all understand each other." He looks at Mara. "Want to try?"

"Sure," Mara says. 

## What is continuous delivery

Mara begins. "To me, CD and DevOps are inseparable. Remember that we defined DevOps as the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.

"CD itself is a set of processes, tools and techniques that makes rapid, reliable and continuous delivery of software possible. So CD isn't only about setting up a pipeline, although that's important. It's about setting up a working environment where:

* We have a reliable and repeatable process for releasing and deploying software.
* We automate as much as possible.
* We don't put off doing something that's difficult or painful. Instead, we do it more often so that we figure out how to make it routine. 
* We keep everything in source control.
* We all agree that "done" means “released.”
* We build quality into the process. It's never an afterthought.
* We all are responsible for the release process. No more silos.
* We always try to improve. 

"We've already put some of these things into place and we all think they've improved how we work. CD is an extension of what we've already started."

## Why should I use continuous delivery

"Thanks, Mara," Andy says. "We need CD because, as we all know, the world has changed. Releases with new features are happening faster. Updates and bug fixes need to be available right away. It isn't just that management wants this. They're simply reacting to the demands of our customers. If customers can't get what they want from us, they'll go somewhere else.

"The old way of doing things, where we were all shut up in our separate silos is too slow and, honestly, it's frustrating for all of us.

"We need to work together if we're going to succeed. All of us have seen how automation gives us a reliable, repeatable, faster process for building artifacts. CD will bring those benefits to an entire release pipeline. 

"Amita, I think your life has gotten better since we added tests to the build pipeline so you weren't getting regression bugs and you also started getting automatic updates on when builds were ready.  

"Tim, I'm going to ask you to be patient. I know you haven't seen a lot of benefit yet, but I promise you, you will. When you're home on the weekends instead of here because we keep crashing your production environment, you'll be happier. Can I ask you both to give CD a chance?"

Amita and Tim look at each other and nod. "Let's get started," says Tim. 

"Thanks, everyone," Andy says. "I'm going to propose that Mara and I put together a simple POC that we can show you. I think everything we'll be a lot easier to understand if can see a CD pipeline in action." 

Tim laughs. "Don't let me stop you from doing all the work!" "Good luck, you two," says Amita.
