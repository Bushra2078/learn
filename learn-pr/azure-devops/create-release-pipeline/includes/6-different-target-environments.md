When you release and deploy at a fast cadence, you need a way to monitor the health and history of your releases.

Let's listen in on the team as they discuss the next steps.

Andy and Mara have just finished demonstrating the the proof of concept build and release pipeline to the team.

**Amita:** If I can get these releases to my test environment on a regular cadence, this will save a lot of time getting a feature through QA. 

**Mara:** Exactly, we can take this release pipeline and expand on it to create a deployment workflow. 

**Tim:** That workflow could include my staging environment too.

The team is excited to see what the new pipeline can do and they all start talking at once.

**Andy:** Wait a second. One step at a time. Yes, I think we can do all of this and more, but this is just s proof of concept. We'll work on expanding it later.

**Amita:** This is great, but how do we know if what we have in this environment is valid? What I mean is, where do I go to see the health of the builds and releases?

**Andy:** Remember the dashboard we made to monitor the health of the builds? Well, we can do the same thing for the releases. This way, we can monitor the health of the whole pipeline, and anyone interested can check in on the system and see what is happening.

**Tim:** Irwin will like that.

**Amita:** Can we add that dashboard to the proof of concept? I want to see what sort of monitoring is available.

**Andy:** Always thinking QA. Yes, let's see what widgets we can add to the dashboard.

The team gathers around Andy's laptop.
