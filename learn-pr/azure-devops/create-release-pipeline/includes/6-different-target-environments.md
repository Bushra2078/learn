From this link, the relevant breadcrumbs are below:

Course > Set Up a Release Management Workflow > Provision and Configure Environments > Provision and Configure Different Target Environments

Also to prep for the next lab (dashboard):

Course > Set Up a Release Management Workflow > Automate Inspection of Health > Automate Inspection of Health

(Just talking about dashboard right now. The other techniques will be added in a later module.)
