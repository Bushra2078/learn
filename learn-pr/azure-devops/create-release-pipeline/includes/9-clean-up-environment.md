You're all done with the tasks for this module. Here, you tear down the Azure resources you created for this module and also clean up your Azure DevOps environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This page contains important cleanup steps. Cleaning up helps ensure that you don't run out of free build minutes. Be sure to perform the cleanup steps if you ran the template earlier in this module.

## Clean up Azure resources

Here, you delete your App Service instance. One way to delete Azure resources, such as an App Service instance, is to delete its parent resource group. Deleting a resource group deletes all resources in that group.

To clean up your resource group:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) and sign in.
1. Select **Resource groups** from the menu.
1. Select your resource group, **TailspinAppServiceRG**.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter **TailspinAppServiceRG** into the text box and then select **Delete**.

    After the deletion process completes, you are taken back to the list of resource groups in your Azure subscription.

## Disable the pipeline or delete your project

Each module in this learning path provides a template you can run to create a clean environment for the duration of the module.

Running multiple templates gives you multiple Azure Pipelines projects, each pointing to the same GitHub repository. This can trigger multiple pipelines to run each time you push a change to your GitHub repository, which can cause you to run out of free build minutes on our hosted agents. Therefore, it's important that you disable or delete your pipeline before moving on to the next module.

Choose one of the following options.

### Option 1 - Disable the pipeline

This option disables the pipeline so that it does not process further build requests. You can re-enable the build pipeline later if you want to. Choose this option if you want to keep your DevOps project and your build pipeline for future reference.

To disable the pipeline:

1. From Azure Pipelines, navigate to your pipeline.
1. Select the **Edit** button.

1. From the menu in the upper corner, select **Settings**.

1. Under **Processing of new run requests**, select **Disabled** and then select **Save**.

    Your pipeline will no longer process build requests.

### Option 2 - Delete the Azure DevOps project

This option deletes your Azure DevOps project, including what's on Azure Boards and your build pipeline. In future modules, you'll be able to run another template that brings up a new project in a state where this one leaves off. Choose this option if you don't need your DevOps project for future reference.

To delete the project:

1. From Azure DevOps, navigate to your project. Earlier, we recommended that you name this project **Space Game - web - Release**.
1. Select the gear icon that's next to the project name.

    The icon might not appear until you move your mouse over that area.

1. From the **Project details** area, scroll to the bottom and select **Delete**.

1. From the window that appears, enter the project name and select **Delete** a second time.

    Your project is now deleted.
