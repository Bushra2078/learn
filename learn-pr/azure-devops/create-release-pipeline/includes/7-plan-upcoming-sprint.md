With the POC a success and some basic monitoring in place, the team is once again excited to see what this pipeline can do. Tim and Amita start asking Andy and Mara a lot of questions. 

Andy glances at Mara and clears his throat.

**Andy:** Hold on. We need to step back and think about this in terms of our new Agile approach to things. We finished our last sprint by accomplishing two goals. We created our backlog by using Azure Boards and we created our pipeline by using Azure Pipelines. Now we need to set up our next sprint iteration. What's our goal and what tasks will let us accomplish it?

**Amita:** Andy is right. Irwin asked us to find a way to speed up deployments. I think that should be the focus of the next sprint. Remember our value stream map? We still have a number of areas where we can improve by cutting down the time it takes us do some activities.

See? we're still slow at running quality tests.

**Tim:** Exactly. And we've still got a bottle-neck at deploying changes to production because management needs to approve new features first.

**Mara:** It sounds like we can start planning what tasks we'll accomplish in this sprint. We need to:

- **Define a release management workflow**
- **Automate quality tests**
- **Improve release cadence**

If that seems right, I'll add these tasks to Azure Boards.

The team agrees. Mara sets up a sprint iteration and adds these tasks:

Each of these tasks relates to what you'll do in the next three modules. You don't need to add these tasks to Azure Boards now. You'll run a template that populates Azure Boards with these tasks, just as you did in previous modules.
