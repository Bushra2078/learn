With a successful POC and some basic monitoring in place, the team is once again excited to see what this pipeline can do. Tim and Amita have questions for Andy and Mara. 

Andy glances at Mara and clears his throat.

**Andy:** Hold on. Let's step back and think about this setup in terms of our new Agile approach. We finished our last sprint by accomplishing two goals. We created our backlog by using Azure Boards, and we created our pipeline by using Azure Pipelines. Now we need to set up our next sprint iteration. What's our goal, and what are our tasks to accomplish it?

**Amita:** Andy is right. Irwin asked us to find a way to speed up deployments. I think that should be the focus of the next sprint. Remember our value stream map?

Amita points to the value stream map, which you originally saw in the [Assess your existing software development process](/learn/modules/assess-your-development-process/4-assess-process-efficiency?azure-portal=true)  module.

**Amita:** In several areas, we can improve by cutting down the time we spend. For example, we're still slow at running quality tests.

**Tim:** Exactly. And we still have a bottleneck at deploying changes to production because management needs to approve new features before we release them.

**Mara:** It sounds like we can start planning the tasks we'll accomplish in this sprint.

The team brainstorms and comes up with these tasks:

- Create a multistage pipeline.
- Connect the web app to a database.
- Automate quality tests.
- Automate performance tests.
- Improve release cadence.

**Mara:** If these tasks seem right, I'll add them to Azure Boards.

The team agrees. Mara sets up a sprint iteration and adds these tasks:

Each of these tasks relates to what you'll do in the following modules. You don't need to add the tasks to Azure Boards now. You'll run a template that populates Azure Boards with these tasks, just as you did in previous modules.
