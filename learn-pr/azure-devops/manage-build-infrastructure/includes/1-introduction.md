The idea here is to demonstrate how to connect pipelines to [self-hosted](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azdevops#install) / private build infrastructure.

We would need explore the scenario here. In other words, why the team might need to set up their builds on self-hosted infrastructure.

Perhaps [review the limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azdevops&tabs=yaml#capabilities-and-limitations) of Microsoft-hosted agents and find one that fits our app/scenario.
