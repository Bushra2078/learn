In this module, you'll add functional tests &mdash; tests that verify an application's behavior &mdash; to the pipeline.

In [Manage database changes in Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/manage-database-changes-in-azure-pipelines?azure-portal=true), you helped the Tailspin web team connect their web application to Azure SQL Database. You also used a release approval to help coordinate changes to the database schema between the developers and the database administrator.

The stages that you and the team defined provide the overall shape of your pipeline, but there's more that you can add to each stage. For example, in the _Test_ stage, Amita still tests the web application manually as she always has. When she's satisfied, she manually promotes the application to _Staging_, where management can review the new features and decide if they want to make the release publicly available.

In [Run quality tests in your build pipeline using Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/run-quality-tests-build-pipeline?azure-portal=true), you incorporated unit and code coverage tests into the build process. These help ensure that there are no regression bugs and that the code meets the company's standards for quality and style. But what kinds of tests can you run once a service is operational and actually deployed to an environment?

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Define what functional tests are and identify some of the more popular kinds of tests you can run.
- Map manual testing steps to automated test cases.
- Run automated UI tests locally and in the pipeline with Selenium.

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression.

To follow the progression from the beginning, be sure to first complete these learning paths:

* [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true)
* [Build applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops?azure-portal=true)

We also recommend you start at the beginning of this learning path, [Deploy applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/deploy-applications-with-azure-devops?azure-portal=true).

If you want to go through just this module, you need to set up a development environment on your Windows, macOS, or Linux system. You need:

* An [Azure DevOps organization](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true)
* An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true)
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/join?azure-portal=true) account
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true)
* [.NET Core 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download?azure-portal=true)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads?azure-portal=true)

You can get started with Azure and Azure DevOps for free.

This environment lets you complete the exercises in this and future modules. You can also use it to apply your new skills to your own projects.
