Your release pipeline now has three stages: _Build_, _Dev_, and _Test_. You and the Tailspin team have one more stage to implement: _Staging_.

In this part, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create the **staging** environment in Azure Pipelines, and assign yourself as an approver.
> * Define the _Staging_ stage, which runs only after an approver verifies the results of the _Test_ stage.

## Create the staging environment

Here, you create an environment in Azure Pipelines for _Staging_. For learning purposes, you assign yourself as the approver. In practice, you would assign the users who are required to sign off on changes before those changes move to the next stage. For the Tailspin team, Amita approves changes so that they can be promoted from _Test_ to _Staging_.

Earlier in this module, you specified `environment` settings for both _Dev_ and _Test_ stages. Here's an example for the _Dev_ stage.

[!code-yml[](code/2-azure-pipelines.yml?highlight=8)]

In this example, Azure Pipelines creates your **dev** environment if it doesn't exist. You can also define an environment through Azure Pipelines that includes specific criteria for your release. This criteria can include the pipelines that are authorized to deploy to the environment. You can also specify the human approvals that are needed to promote the release from one stage to the next. Here, you specify those approvals.

To create the **staging** environment:

1. From Azure Pipelines, select **Environments**.

    ![A screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the location of the Environments menu option.](../media/7-pipelines-environments.png)

1. Select **New environment**.
1. Under **Name**, enter *staging*.
1. Leave the remaining fields at their default values.
1. Select **Create**.
1. On the **staging** environment page, open the dropdown, and then select **Approvals and checks**.

    ![A screenshot of Azure Pipelines, showing the location of the approvals and checks menu item.](../../shared/media/pipeline-add-check-to-environment.png)

1. Select **Approvals**.
1. Under **Approvers**, select **Add users and groups**, and then select your account.
1. Under **Instructions to approvers**, enter *Approve this change when it's ready for staging*.
1. Select **Create**.

## Promote changes to Staging

Here you modify your pipeline configuration to deploy the build to the _Staging_ stage.

1. In Visual Studio Code, modify *azure-pipelines.yml* like this:

    [!code-yml[](code/6-azure-pipelines.yml?highlight=130-151)]

    This code adds the _Staging_ stage. The stage deploys to the **staging** environment, which includes a release approval.

    > [!TIP]
    > You probably noticed that all three of your deployment stages follow similar steps. You can use _templates_ to define common build tasks one time and reuse them multiple times. You already used this technique in the [Create a build pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-a-build-pipeline/8-build-multiple-configurations?azure-portal=true) module. For learning purposes, we repeat the steps in each stage.

1. From the integrated terminal, add *azure-pipelines.yml* to the index. Next, commit the change and push it up to GitHub.

    > [!TIP]
    > Before you run these Git commands, save *azure-pipelines.yml*.

    ```bash
    git add azure-pipelines.yml
    git commit -m "Deploy to Staging"
    git push origin release
    ```

1. In Azure Pipelines, go to the build. Trace the build as it runs.

    When the build reaches _Staging_, you see that the pipeline waits for all checks to pass. In this case, there's one check - the manual release approval.

    ![A screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the Staging stage, which requires manual approval.](../media/7-pipeline-review.png)

    You can configure Azure DevOps to send you an email notification when the build requires approval. Here's an example:

    ![A screenshot of a portion of a build approval email notification.](../media/6-email-notification.png)

1. Select **Review** > **Approve**.

    In practice, to verify that they meet your requirements, you would inspect the changes.

1. After the build finishes, open a web browser. Navigate to the URL that's associated with the App Service instance for your **staging** environment.

    If you still have the browser tab open, refresh the page. If you don't remember the URL, find it in the Azure portal, on the **App Service details** page.

    You see that the _Space Game_ website is deployed to App Service and is running.

    ![A screenshot of web browser showing the Space Game website in the Staging environment.](../media/6-app-service-staging.png)

1. As an optional step, in Azure Pipelines, select **Environments**. Next, select the **staging** environment.

    Azure Pipelines records your deployment history, which enables you to trace changes in the environment back to code commits and work items.

The Tailspin team gathers to discuss their progress. Amita approves changes in the _Test_ stage while the others watch.

**Tim:** To tell you the truth, at first I was a little nervous about automated release pipelines. But I really like this now that I see it working. Each stage can have its own environment, associated tests, and approvers. The pipeline automates many things that we had to do manually. But we still have control where we need it.

**Amita:** I could imagine us doing something similar to promote changes from _Staging_ to _Production_. Speaking of which, when will we add a **production** environment?

**Andy:** We'll add that shortly. I think we still need to fill in a few pieces here first.
