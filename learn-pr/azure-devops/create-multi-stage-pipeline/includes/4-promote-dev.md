The team has a plan and is ready to begin implementing their release pipeline. You've set up your Azure DevOps project, and your Azure App Service instances are ready to receive build artifacts. 

At this point, remember that the team's pipeline has only two stages. The first stage produces the build artifact. The second stage deploys the _Space Game_ web application to App Service. Here you follow along with Andy and Mara as they modify the pipeline. They'll deploy to the App Service environment that corresponds to the _Dev_ stage.

The _Dev_ stage resembles the deployment stage that you made in the [Create a release pipeline in Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-release-pipeline?azure-portal=true) module. There, you used a CI trigger to start the build process. Here you do the same.

## Fetch the branch from GitHub

Here you fetch the `release` branch from GitHub. You also check out, or switch to, the branch.

This branch serves as your _release_ branch. It contains the _Space Game_ project that you used in previous modules. It also contains an Azure Pipelines configuration to start with.

To fetch and switch to the branch:

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal.
1. Run the following `git` commands to fetch a branch named `release` from the Microsoft repository and to switch to that branch.

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream release
    git checkout -b release upstream/release
    ```

    The format of these commands enables you to get starter code from the Microsoft GitHub repository, known as `upstream`. Shortly, you'll push this branch up to your GitHub repository, known as `origin`.

1. As an optional step, open *azure-pipelines.yml* from Visual Studio Code. Familiarize yourself with the initial configuration.

    The configuration resembles the basic one that you created in the [Create a release pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-release-pipeline?azure-portal=true) module. It builds only the application's release configuration. For learning purposes, this configuration doesn't run the quality or security checks that you set up in previous modules.

## Promote changes to the Dev stage

Here you modify your pipeline configuration to promote the build to the _Dev_ stage.

1. In Visual Studio Code, modify *azure-pipelines.yml*:

    [!code-yml[](code/4-azure-pipelines.yml?highlight=3,66,69-74,92)]

    This configuration resembles the one that you built in the previous module. There, you and the team built a proof of concept (POC) for continuous deployment. But note these differences, which are highlighted in the preceding code example:

    * This configuration defines variables at the top of the file. The variables are used throughout the pipeline. They define which configuration to build (`Release`). They also define the name of your release branch (`release`).
    * The **Deploy** stage from the POC is now named **Dev**.
    * The **Dev** stage uses a condition that directs the system to run the stage only when the previous stage succeeds and the current branch is `release`. This setup ensures that release features are deployed only to the _Dev_ environment.
    * The deployment step uses the `WebAppNameDev` variable to deploy to the App Service instance that's associated with the _Dev_ environment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In practice, you might deploy from some other branch, such as `master`. You can include logic that allows changes to be promoted to the _Dev_ stage from multiple branches, such as `release` and `master`.

1. From the integrated terminal, add *azure-pipelines.yml* to the index. Commit the change and push it up to GitHub.

    > [!TIP]
    > Save *azure-pipelines.yml* before you run these Git commands.

    ```bash
    git add azure-pipelines.yml
    git commit -m "Deploy to the Dev stage"
    git push origin release
    ```

1. In Azure Pipelines, go to the build. Trace the build as it runs.
1. After the build finishes, select the back button to return to the summary page.

    ![Azure Pipelines, showing the completed stages](../media/4-pipeline-dev-stage-summary.png)

    You see that the deployment finished successfully.
1. From a web browser, navigate to the URL that's associated with the App Service instance for your _Dev_ environment.

    If you still have the browser tab open, refresh the page. If you don't remember the URL, find it in the Azure portal, on the App Service details page.

    You see that the _Space Game_ website is deployed to App Service and is running.

1. As an optional step, in Azure Pipelines, select **Environments**. Then select the **dev** environment.

    Azure Pipelines records your deployment history. In the history, you can trace the environment's changes back to code commits and work items.
