Your release pipeline still has two stages but they're different than before. The stages are: _Build_ and _Dev_. Every change you push to GitHub triggers the _Build_ stage to run. The _Dev_ stage runs only when the change is in the _release_ branch. Here, you add the _Test_ stage to the pipeline.

Recall that the team decided to use a scheduled trigger to promote the build from the _Dev_ stage to the _Test_ stage at 3 A.M. each morning. To do this, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Define the schedule in your build configuration.
> * Define the _Test_ stage, which includes a condition that runs the stage only if the build reason is marked as "Schedule".

For learning purposes, here you define the schedule but allow the build to proceed directly from _Dev_ to _Test_ so that you don't have to wait for the schedule to trigger. After you complete this module, you can experiment with different cron expressions so that the _Test_ stage runs only at the scheduled time.

## Promote changes to the _Test_ stage

Here you modify your pipeline configuration to deploy the build to the _Test_ stage.

1. In Visual Studio Code, modify *azure-pipelines.yml* like this.

    [!code-yml[](code/6-azure-pipelines.yml?highlight=5-11,103-125)]

    The `schedules` section defines one cron expression. You can define more than one expression in your configuration. The expression triggers the pipeline to run against the release branch at 3 A.M. each day. The `always` flag is set to `false` so that the pipeline runs only when the _release_ branch contains changes from the prior run.

    The `Test` stage defines a condition that runs the stage only when the build reason equals "Schedule". (The built-in variable `Build.Reason` defines the build reason.) If this condition is false, the stage is skipped, but the prior stages continue to run.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Remember, the condition is shown here for learning purposes, but it's commented to enable the change to progress from _Dev_ to _Test_ without the need for you to wait for the schedule to trigger.

1. From the integrated terminal, add *azure-pipelines.yml* to the index, commit the change, and push the change up to GitHub.

    > [!TIP]
    > Remember to save *azure-pipelines.yml* before running these Git commands.

    ```bash
    git add azure-pipelines.yml
    git commit -m "Deploy to the Test stage"
    git push origin release
    ```

1. In Azure Pipelines, go to the build and trace the build as it runs.
1. After the build completes, press the back button to return to the summary page.

    You see that the deployment completed successfully.
1. From a web browser, navigate to the URL that's associated with the App Service instance for your _Test_ environment.

    If you still have the browser tab open, simply refresh the page. If you need a refresher, you can find the URL from the App Service details page in the Azure portal.

    You see that the _Space Game_ website has been successfully deployed to App Service and is running.

1. As an optional step, in Azure Pipelines, select **Environments**. Then select the **test** environment.

    Azure Pipelines records your deployment history, which enables you to trace changes in the environment back to code commits and work items.

Andy and Mara add the _Test_ stage to the pipeline and then show the results to Amita.

**Amita:** I like the fact that any changes you make are built and deployed for me to test each morning. But I don't see how I have control over when changes make it to _Staging_.

**Mara:** Indeed, deploying through automation is a huge time saver. Remember that, so far, we've only included the scheduled trigger. We'll add a release approval for you when we set up the _Staging_ environment for Tim. That way, changes move to _Staging_ only when you're ready.
