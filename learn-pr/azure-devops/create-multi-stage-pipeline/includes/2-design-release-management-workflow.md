In this part, you follow the Tailspin web team as they define their release pipeline for the _Space Game_ website.

When you plan a release pipeline, you usually begin by identifying the stages, or major divisions of that pipeline. Each stage typically maps to an environment. For example, in the previous module, Andy and Mara's basic pipeline had a _Deploy_ stage which mapped to an Azure App Service instance.

In this module, you _promote_ changes from one stage to the next. Within each stage, you _deploy_ the _Space Game_ website to the environment that's associated with that stage.

After you define which stages you need, you need to consider how changes are promoted from one stage to the next. Each stage can define its own success criteria that must be met before the build can move to the next stage. Azure Pipelines provides several ways to help you control how and when changes move through the pipeline. As a whole, these different approaches are used for _release management_.

In this section, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Learn the differences between common pipeline stages, such as _Build_, _Dev_, _Test_, and _Staging_.
> * Understand how manual, scheduled, and continuous deployment triggers enable you to control when an artifact moves to the next stage in the pipeline.
> * See how a *release approval* pauses the pipeline until an approver accepts or rejects the release.

## The meeting

The entire Tailspin web team is gathered together. In [Create a release pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-release-pipeline?azure-portal=true), the team planned their tasks for the current sprint. Each task relates to building their release pipeline for the _Space Game_ web site.

Recall that the team decided on these five tasks for their sprint:

- **Create a multi-stage pipeline**
- **Connect the web app to a database**
- **Automate quality tests**
- **Automate performance tests**
- **Improve release cadence**

The team meets to talk about the first task, **Create a multi-stage pipeline**. Defining the pipeline first will help the team to move from their basic proof of concept to a more complete release pipeline that includes additional stages, quality checks, and approvals.

Amita and Tim are watching Andy and Mara demo the release pipeline a second time. They see that the artifact gets built and installed on App Service.

## What pipeline stages do you need?

When you want to implement a release pipeline, it's important to first identify which stages you need. The stages you choose depend on your requirements. Let's follow along with the team as they decide on theirs.

**Tim:** OK. I understand the idea of an automated pipeline. I like how easy it is to deploy to Azure. But where do we go from here? This is just a demo. We need something we can actually use for our releases.

**Amita:** Right. We need to add some other stages. There's no place for test, for example.

**Tim:** Plus, we need a stage where we can show new features to management. I can't send anything to production without their approval.

**Andy:** Absolutely. Now that we're up to speed on what a release pipeline does, what do we need to do to make this a pipeline that really does what what we need?

**Mara:** Let's sketch out our requirements on the whiteboard. That might help us plan our next steps. Let's start with what we have.

Mara moves to the whiteboard and sketches the existing pipeline.

![A whiteboard showing the Build and Deploy stages](../media/2-build-deploy.png)

**Mara:** The _Build_ stage builds the source code and produces a package: a _.zip_ file in our case. The _Deploy_ stage installs that _.zip_ file, the _Space Game_ website, on an App Service instance. What's missing from our release pipeline?

## Add the _Dev_ stage

**Andy:** I may be biased but I think we need a _Dev_ stage. That should be the first stop for the artifact after it's built. For one thing, developers can't always run the entire service from their local development environment. For example, an e-commerce system might require the website, the products database, a payment system, and so on. We need a stage that includes everything the app needs.

In our case, the _Space Game_ website's leaderboard feature reads high scores from an external source. Right now, it reads fictitious scores from a file. Setting up a _Dev_ stage would give us an environment where we can integrate the web app with a real database. That database might still hold fictitious scores, but it brings us one step closer to our final app.

**Mara:** I like it. We won't integrate with a real database quite yet, but a _Dev_ stage enables us to deploy to an environment where we can add one.

Mara updates her drawing on the whiteboard. She replaces "Deploy" with "Dev" to show the _Dev_ stage.

![A whiteboard showing the Build and Dev stages](../media/2-add-dev-stage.png)

**Andy:** This brings up an interesting point. We build the app each time we push a change to GitHub. Does that mean each build is promoted to the _Dev_ stage after it completes?

**Mara:** Building continuously gives us important feedback about our build and test health. But we only want to promote to the _Dev_ stage when we merge code into some central branch: either `master` or some other release branch. I'll update the drawing to show that requirement.

![A whiteboard showing the Build and Dev stages](../media/2-add-dev-stage-trigger.png)

I think this will be easy to accomplish. We can define a *condition* that promotes to the _Dev_ stage only when changes happen on a release branch.

## What are conditions?

In Azure Pipelines, a _condition_ enables you to run a task or job based on the state of the pipeline. You worked with conditions in previous modules.

As a refresher, some of the conditions you can specify are:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Only when all previous dependent tasks have succeeded.
> * Even if a previous dependency has failed, unless the run was canceled.
> * Even if a previous dependency has failed, even if the run was canceled.
> * Only when a previous dependency has failed.
> * Some custom condition.

Here's a basic example:

``` yml
steps:
  - script: echo Hello!
    condition: always()
```

The `always()` condition causes this task to print "Hello!" unconditionally, even if previous tasks failed.

Here's the condition that's used if you don't specify one:

```yml
condition: succeeded()
```

The `succeeded()` built-in function checks whether the previous task succeeded. If the previous task failed, this task and subsequent tasks with the same condition are skipped.

Here, you want to build a condition that specifies that:

* The previous task succeeded.
* The name of the current Git branch is "release".

To build this condition, you use the built-in `and()` function. This function checks whether each of its conditions is true. If any condition isn't true, the overall condition fails.

To get the name of the current branch, you use the built-in `Build.SourceBranchName` variable. There are a few ways to access variables within a condition. Here you use the `variables[]` syntax.

To test a variable's value, you can use the built-in `eq()` function. This function checks whether its arguments are equal.

With that in mind, here's the condition you apply to run the _Dev_ stage only when the current branch name is "release":

```yml
condition: |
  and
  (
    succeeded(),
    eq(variables['Build.SourceBranchName'], 'release')
  )
```

The first condition in the `and()` function checks whether the previous task succeeded. The second condition checks whether the current branch name equals "release".

In YAML, you use the `|` syntax to define a string that spans multiple lines. You could define the condition on a single line, but we write it this way to make it more readable.

> [!NOTE]
> In this module, we use the _release_ branch as an example. You can combine conditions to define the behavior you need. For example, you could build a condition that runs the stage only when the build is triggered by a pull request against the _master_ branch.

You'll work with a more complete example shortly when you set up the _Dev_ stage.

**Mara:** Conditions let us to control which changes are promoted to which stages. We can produce a build artifact for any change to validate that our build is healthy. When we're ready, we can merge those changes into a release branch and promote that build to the _Dev_ stage.

## Add the _Test_ stage

**Mara:** So far, we have the _Build_ and _Dev_ stages. What comes next?

**Amita:** Can we add the _Test_ stage next? That seems like the right place for me to test out the latest changes.

Mara adds the _Test_ stage to her drawing on the whiteboard.

![A whiteboard showing the Build, Dev, and Test stages](../media/2-add-test-stage.png)

**Amita:** One concern I have is how often I need to test the app. I get an email that notifies me whenever Mara or Andy make a change. Changes happen throughout the day, and I never know when to jump in. I think I'd like to see a build once a day. Maybe it can be there when I get in to the office. Can we do that?

**Andy:** Sure. Why don't we deploy to _Test_ during off-hours? Let's say we send you a build every day at 3 A.M.

**Mara:** That sounds good. We can always manually trigger the process as well if we need to, for example, if we have an important bug fix that we need you to verify for us right away.

Mara updates her drawing to show that the build moves from the _Dev_ stage to the _Test_ stage at 3 A.M. each morning.

![A whiteboard showing the Build, Dev, and Test stages](../media/2-add-test-stage-schedule.png)

### What are triggers?

**Amita:** I'm feeling better now that we know how one stage moves to another but how do we control when a stage runs?

**Mara:** In Azure Pipelines, we can use triggers. A *trigger* defines when a stage runs. Azure Pipelines provides a few different types of triggers. Here are our choices:

* A continuous integration (CI) trigger
* A pull request (PR) trigger
* A scheduled trigger
* A build completion trigger

CI and PR triggers let us control which branches participate in the overall process. For example, we want to build the project when a change is made on any branch. A scheduled trigger starts a deployment at a specific time. A build completion trigger runs a build when another build, such as one for a dependent component, completes successfully. It seems like we want a scheduled trigger.

### What are scheduled triggers?

A scheduled trigger uses [cron syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/build/triggers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml&azure-portal=true#supported-cron-syntax) to cause a build to run on a defined schedule.

On Unix and Linux systems, cron is a popular way to schedule jobs to run on a set time interval or at a specific time. In Azure Pipelines, scheduled triggers use the cron syntax to define when a stage runs.

A cron expression includes fields that match certain time parameters. These fields are:

```
mm HH DD MM DW
 \  \  \  \  \__ Days of week
  \  \  \  \____ Months
   \  \  \______ Days
    \  \________ Hours
     \__________ Minutes
```

For example, the cron expression that describes "3 A.M. every day" is: 

> **0 3 \* \* \***

A cron expression can include special characters to specify a list of values or a range of values. In this example, "*" matches all values for the **Days**, **Months**, and **Days of week** fields.

Put another way, this cron expression reads as:

* At minute 0,
* At the third hour,
* On any day of the month,
* On any month,
* On any day of the week,
* Run the job

To specify 3 A.M. only on days Monday through Friday, you would use:

> **0 3 \* \* 1-5**

> [!NOTE]
> The time zone for cron schedules is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), so in this example, 3 A.M. refers to 3 A.M. in UTC. In practice, you might adjust the time in your cron schedule relative to UTC so that the pipeline runs at the expected time for you and your team.

To set up a scheduled trigger in Azure Pipelines, you need a `schedules` section in your YAML file. Here's an example:

```yml
schedules:
- cron: '0 3 * * *'
  displayName: Deploy every day at 3 A.M.
  branches:
    include:
    - release
  always: false
```

Here:

* `cron` specifies the cron expression.
* `branches` specifies to deploy only from the `release` branch.
* `always` specifies whether to run the deployment unconditionally (`true`), or only when the `release` branch has changed since the last run (`false`).

    Here, we specify `false` because we need to deploy only when the `release` branch has changed since the last run.

The entire pipeline runs when Azure Pipelines executes a scheduled trigger. The pipeline also runs under other conditions, such as when you push a change to GitHub. To run a stage only in response to a scheduled trigger, you can use a condition that checks whether the reason for the build is a scheduled run.

Here's an example:

```yml
- stage: 'Test'
  displayName: 'Deploy to the Test environment'
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'Schedule'))
```

This stage, `Test`, runs only when the previous stage succeeds and the built-in `Build.Reason` pipeline variable equals "Schedule".

You'll see a more complete example later in this module.

**Amita:** I like this. I don't even have to pick up the release by hand anymore and install it. It'll be all ready for me.

**Andy:** And remember, if we want to make things more automated later on, we can. Nothing's written in stone. The pipeline evolves as we improve and learn more.

## Add the _Staging_ stage

**Tim:** It's my turn. I need a stage where I can run additional stress tests. We also need a stage that we can demo to management to get their approval. For now, we can combine those two functions into a stage that we can call _Staging_.

**Andy:** Well said, Tim. Having a staging, or pre-production, environment is an important piece here. It's often the last stop before a feature or bug fix makes it to our users.

Mara adds the _Staging_ stage to her drawing on the whiteboard.

![A whiteboard showing the Build, Dev, Test, and Staging stages](../media/2-add-staging-stage.png)

**Amita:** I know that we use a scheduled trigger to promote changes from the _Dev_ stage to the _Test_ stage. But how will we promote changes from _Test_ to _Staging_? Does that also have to happen on a schedule?

**Mara:** I think the best way to handle that would be to use a _release approval_. A release approval lets you manually promote a change from one stage to the next.

**Amita:** That sounds like exactly what I need! A release approval would give me the time to test out the latest changes before we present the build to management. I can promote the build when I'm ready.

Mara updates her drawing to show that the build moves from _Test_ to _Staging_ only when Amita approves it.

![A whiteboard showing the Build, Dev, Test, and Staging stages](../media/2-add-staging-stage-approval.png)

**Tim:** I could also see us using release approvals to promote from _Staging_ to _Production_, after management signs off. I can never predict how long that takes. Once they sign off I can approve the release and promote it to production manually. But how do release approvals work?

### What are release approvals?

A *release approval* is a way to pause the pipeline until an approver accepts or rejects the release. You can combine approvals, conditions, and triggers to define your release workflow.

Recall that in [Create a release pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-release-pipeline?azure-portal=true), you defined an _environment_ in your pipeline configuration to represent your deployment environment. Here's an example from your existing pipeline:

[!code-yml[](code/2-azure-pipelines.yml?highlight=8)]

In this example, Azure Pipelines creates the **dev** environment for you if it doesn't exist. You can also define an environment that includes specific criteria for your release. The criteria can include which pipelines are authorized to deploy to that environment and what human approvals are needed to promote the release from one stage to the next.

Later in this module, you'll define the **staging** environment and assign yourself as an approver to promote the _Space Game_ web application from the _Test_ stage to _Staging_.

## Automate as little or as much as you need

Azure Pipelines gives you the flexibility to automate what you're able to, while maintaining manual control over those stages that aren't ready yet for automation. 

**Tim:** I like how we can define the criteria that promote changes from one stage to the next. But we've defined some manual criteria in our pipeline. I thought DevOps was about automating everything.

**Mara:** You raise a good point. DevOps is really about automating repetitive and error-prone tasks. There are times when human intervention is necessary, for example, when gaining approval from management before we release new features.

As we get more experience with our automated deployments, we can automate more of our manual steps to speed up the process. For example, perhaps we can automate additional quality checks in the _Test_ stage so Amita doesn't have to approve each build.

**Tim:** Sounds great. Let's go with this plan for now and see how we can speed things up later.

**Amita:** Speaking of our plan, can we summarize what steps we'll take next ?

## The plan

Let's review the Tailspin team's plan as they move towards next steps.

**Mara:** Here's the release pipeline we want to build.

Mara points to the whiteboard.

![A whiteboard showing the Build, Dev, Test, and Staging stages](../media/2-add-staging-stage-approval.png)

**Mara:** To summarize, our steps are to:

1. Produce a build artifact each time we push a change to GitHub. This happens in the _Build_ stage.
1. Promote the build artifact to the _Dev_ stage. This happens automatically when the build stage succeeds and the change is on the _release_ branch.
1. Promote the build artifact to the _Test_ stage each morning at 3 A.M. This happens automatically by using a scheduled trigger.
1. Promote the build artifact to _Staging_ after Amita tests and approves the build. This happens by using a release approval.

Later, we can deploy the build artifact to a production environment after management approves the build.

**Amita:** Is this going to be hard to do? It seems like a lot of work.

**Mara:** I don't think it will be too bad. Every stage is separate from every other stage. Stages are discrete. Each stage has its own set of tasks. What happens in the _Test_ stage, for example, stays in the _Test_ stage.

Every deployment stage in our pipeline also has its own environment. For example, when we deploy the app to _Dev_ or _Test_, the environment is an App Service instance.

Finally, we only ever test one release at a time. We never change releases in the middle of the pipeline. We use the same release in the _Dev_ stage as in the _Staging_ stage and every release has its own version number. If the release breaks in one of the stages, we fix it and build it again with a new version number. That new release then goes through the pipeline from the very beginning.
