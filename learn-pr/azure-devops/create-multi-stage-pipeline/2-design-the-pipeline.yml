quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your pipeline includes many tests and quality checks that take several minutes to complete. Which kind of trigger can you use to limit your tests to run only on code that's been reviewed by a peer?"
    choices:
    - content: "A build completion trigger."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A build completion trigger runs a build when another build, such as one for a dependent component, completes successfully."
    - content: "A CI or PR trigger."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "CI and PR triggers let us control which branches participate in the overall process. You can use them to run your pipeline only during a pull request or after a pull request is merged into a certain branch, such as `master` or a release branch."
    - content: "A scheduled trigger."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you could use a scheduled trigger to run tests on a regular interval, is there a better way that will run your tests at the time it's needed, and only when it's needed?"
  - content: "How can you pause the pipeline until a change is signed off by an approver?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a release approval."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A release approval pauses the pipeline until an approver accepts or rejects the release."
    - content: "Install a Marketplace extension that provides Azure Pipelines tasks that can pause the pipeline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you might find such an extension, is there a built-in mechanism that you can use?"
    - content: "Ask your approver to look at the change and then manually trigger the pipeline to run."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Is there a more automated way that would allow the approver to see working software, and then promote the process to the next stage?"
  - content: "You want to build and deploy your webapp to the _Test_ environment each time another build completes. What's the easiest way to set that up?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a scheduled trigger."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although a scheduled trigger enables you to build your webapp and pick up the latest dependencies on a regular schedule, it does not trigger your pipeline to run when another build completes."
    - content: "Watch for build notification emails and manually trigger your build when the other one completes successfully."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you could do this, it's not efficient. Is there a way to automatically trigger the build?"
    - content: "Use a build completion trigger."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A build completion trigger runs a build when another build, such as one for a dependent component, completes successfully."
