Azure DevOps can help your team collaborate and plan work better using Azure Boards. We'll use an Agile approach with the team from Tailspin Toys. Let's get started by creating an Azure DevOps project and creating an Azure Board.

You've met the Tailspin team and learned a bit about their problems. Mara, the newest team member, is trying to convince her teammates that a DevOps approach using the services in Azure DevOps is a great way to solve them. She's taken it upon herself to do the DevOps Assessment and she's shown everyone the results. This module is about what happens next.

In this module, you will:

- Create an Azure DevOps project
- Add work items to an Azure Board using the Basic process
- Assign team members to work items
