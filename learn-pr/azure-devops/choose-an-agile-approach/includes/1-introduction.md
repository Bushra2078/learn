You've met the Tailspin team and learned a bit about their problems. Mara, the newest team member, is trying to convince her team mates that a DevOps approach together with Azure DevOps services is a great way to solve them. She's taken it upon herself to do the DevOps Assessment and she's showed everyone the results. This module is about what happens next.

In this module, you will:

- Create an Azure DevOps project
- Add work items to an Azure Board using the Basic process
- Assign team members to work items

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true) account

If you don't already have an Azure DevOps account, we highly recommend you go through [Get started with Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/get-started-with-devops?azure-portal=true) before starting this module.
