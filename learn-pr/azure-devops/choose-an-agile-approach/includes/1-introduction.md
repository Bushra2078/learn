You've met the Tailspin team and learned a bit about their problems. Mara, the newest team member, is trying to convince her teammates that a DevOps approach using the services in Azure DevOps is a great way to solve them. She's taken it upon herself to do the DevOps Assessment and she's shown everyone the results. 

Her next goal is to convince the Tailspin team to take their first DevOps steps using an Agile approach and Azure Boards, a part of the Azure DevOps suite. Azure Boards helps teams collaborate and plan work better. This module shows how the team creates their first board.

In this module, you will:

- Create an Azure DevOps project
- Add work items to an Azure Board using the Basic process
- Assign team members to work items

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression. We recommend you start at the beginning of the [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true) learning path before starting this module.

If you'd rather take just this module, go through [Get started with Azure DevOps](/learn/modules/get-started-with-devops?azure-portal=true) first to get up with your Azure DevOps account.
