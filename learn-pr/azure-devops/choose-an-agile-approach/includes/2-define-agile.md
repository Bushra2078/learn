<!-- TODO We're missing knowledge needed around defining Agile and its various types. Add that here. -->

Mara felt that she'd made made a few small steps toward interesting her team in DevOps but progress stalled. The team has been too busy fixing bugs in the last release to think about anything else. Getting the game into production wasn't fun. Andy and Mara would write code and then hand it to Amita, the tester. She always seemed to find new bugs and had to hand the code back. The build server failed. Tim couldn't get the game's web site to work in production, even after it worked in dev and test. Everyone worked long hours and lost a couple weekends.

After they shipped, Mara and Andy sat down for coffee. They're both tired. Mara is discouraged but Andy has a different attitude.

Andy: "I don't know why you're surprised. Getting software out the door is hard. It's always a slog. Have you ever done it differently?"

Mara: "I have and I think we could make things easier here, too. I really believe DevOps can help us."

Andy: I remember we did the DevOps Assessment but now what? We've got to get started on the new release. I thought we were done with DevOps.

Mara: There's a lot more we can do. I think we should take the first step and do some Agile planning. We can use Azure Boards to help us.

Andy: What do you mean by Agile?

Mara: Agile is an approach to software development. The term "Agile" was coined in 2001 in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org?azure-portal=true). The manifesto established some guiding principles for a better approach to software development. The manifesto says...

We value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan


 Andy: Look, if you know some magic way to make life easier, I'm all for it. My kids are always asleep by the time I get home. But this sounds very touchy-feely without any concrete solutions.

 Mara: It's not magic, but we can do it bit by bit and Azure DevOps gives us the tools we need to implement Agile practicies. For now, when we want to plan, we can use Azure Boards.

 First, can you explain the build process to me and help me identify the big problems?

 After a lot of coffee, Mara and Andy identify the biggest problems in the build process. All of the issues came up during the last release. After Andy leaves, Mara looks at her scribbled notes and decides to do a little Agile planning herself. On her own, she uses the Basic version of Azure boards to get all the problems in one place. 

Her next step is to show the board to the team and get them involved.
