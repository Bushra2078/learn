Mara felt that she'd made made a few small steps toward interesting her team in DevOps but progress stalled. The team has been too busy fixing bugs in the last release to think about anything else. Getting the game into production wasn't fun. Andy and Mara would write code and then hand it to Amita, the tester. She always seemed to find new bugs and had to hand the code back. The build server failed. Tim couldn't get the game's web site to work in production, even after it worked in dev and test. Everyone worked long hours and lost a couple weekends.

After they shipped, Mara and Andy sat down for coffee. They're both tired. Mara is discouraged but Andy has a different attitude.

Andy: "I don't know why you're surprised. Getting software out the door is hard. It's always a slog. Have you ever done it differently?"

Mara: "I have and I think we could make things easier here, too. I really believe DevOps can help us."

Andy: I remember we did the DevOps Assessment but now what? We've got to get started on the new release. I thought we were done with DevOps.

Mara: There's a lot more we can do. I think we should take the first step and do some Agile planning. We can use Azure Boards to help us.

Andy: Look, if you know some magic way to make life easier, I'm all for it. My kids are always asleep by the time I get home. I just don't have much time to learn some new application.

Mara: It's not magic, but we can do it bit by bit and using Azure boards is very easy. Can you explain the build process to me and help me identify the big problems?

After a lot of coffee, Mara and Andy identify the biggest problems in the build process. All of the issues came up during the last release. After Andy leaves, Alice looks at her scribbled notes and decides to do a little Agile planning herself. On her own, she uses the Basic process in Azure Boards to get all the problems in one place. Here's what here board looks like:

Her next step is to get the team involved.
