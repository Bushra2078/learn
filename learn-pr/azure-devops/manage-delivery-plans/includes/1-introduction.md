Azure DevOps can help your team scale their development processes to deliver bigger and more ambitious projects. Let's rejoin the team as they tackle a common problem organizations face as they grow. Together, we'll discover what it takes to effectively manage work schedules across multiple teams.

You met the team at Tailspin Toys earlier in this learning path. In the [previous module](/learn/modules/choose-an-agile-approach?azure-portal=true), you watched as they began to manage their work schedule through Azure Boards. Soon, word of their early success began to spread, and now other teams are exploring how they can enjoy the same benefits.

As more teams adopt Azure Boards, the organization begins to see the network effects of having their planning consolidate around a consistent process. Problems that were once written off a cost of doing business now have achievable solutions. Let's watch the team as they lead their organization in its evolution.

In this module, you will:

- Install the Delivery Plans extension for your Azure DevOps project
- Create a delivery plan
- Adjust a team's sprint workload to optimize delivery efficiency

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression. We recommend you start at the beginning of the [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true) learning path before you work on this module.

If you'd rather do only this module, go through [Get started with Azure DevOps](/learn/modules/get-started-with-devops?azure-portal=true) first to set up your Azure DevOps organization.

## Meet the team

You met the _Space Game_ web team at Tailspin Toys in previous modules. As a refresher, here's who you'll work with in this module.
