Nice job! Your pipeline is developing into a very useful part of your process. You and the Tailspin team now have a pipeline that deploys your infrastructure by using an Azure Resource Manager template and a parameters file. The pipeline also builds the projects and deploys the web app. It includes consideration for database schema changes. 

In this module, you learned about what you need to consider when using a Resource Manager template to provision your infrastructure in Azure Pipelines.

You learned:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * How to implement infrastructure as code by using Resource Manager templates.
> * How to design a Resource Manager template for Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database to use in Azure Pipelines.
> * How to use Azure Key Vault to store and retrieve secrets by using Resource Manager templates and Azure Pipelines.
> * What's needed to add a Resource Manager template to Azure Pipelines.

The team successfully designed and built a pipeline that manages the infrastructure, as well as the database changes for its deployment.

For learning purposes, in this module you provisioned a database for the website that's running in the _Dev_ environment. You can extend this configuration to deploy a unique database that's associated with other environments, such as _Test_, _Staging_, or _Production_.
