In this section, you make sure that your Azure DevOps organization is set up to complete the rest of this module.

To do this, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add a user to ensure Azure DevOps can connect to your Azure subscription.
> * Set up an Azure DevOps project for this module.
> * Move the work item for this module on Azure Boards to the **Doing** column.
> * Make sure your project is set up locally so that you can push changes to the pipeline.

## Add a user to Azure DevOps

To complete this module, you need your own [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true). You can get started with Azure for free.

Although you don't need an Azure subscription to work with Azure DevOps, here you'll use Azure DevOps to deploy to resources that exist in your Azure subscription. To simplify the process, you need to sign in to both your Azure subscription and your Azure DevOps organization under the same Microsoft account.

If you use different Microsoft accounts to sign into Azure and Azure DevOps, add a user to your DevOps organization under the Microsoft account you use to sign in to Azure. [Add users to your organization or project](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser&azure-portal=true) explains how to add a user. When you add the user, choose the **Basic** access level.

Then sign out of Azure DevOps and sign in again under the Microsoft account you use to sign in to your Azure subscription.

## Get the Azure DevOps project

Here, you make sure that your Azure DevOps organization is set up to complete the rest of this module. You do this by running a template that creates a project for you in Azure DevOps.

The modules in this learning path form a progression, where you follow the Tailspin web team through their DevOps journey. For learning purposes, each module has an associated Azure DevOps project.

### Run the template

1. Run a template that sets up everything for you in your Azure DevOps organization.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Run the template](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/?name=provision-infrastructure-azure-pipelines&azure-portal=true)

From the Azure DevOps Demo Generator site, perform these steps to run the template.

1. Select **Sign In** and accept the usage terms.
1. From the **Create New Project** page, select your Azure DevOps organization and enter a project name, such as **Space Game - web - ProvisionDB**.
1. Select **Yes, I want to fork this repository** and then select **Authorize**.
1. Select **Create Project**.

    It takes a few moments for the template to run.
1. Select **Navigate to project** to go to your project in Azure DevOps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Clean up your Azure DevOps environment](/learn/modules/provision-database-azure-pipelines/7-clean-up-environment?azure-portal=true) page in this module contains important cleanup steps. Cleaning up helps ensure that you don't run out of free build minutes. Be sure to perform the cleanup steps even if you don't complete this module.

## Move the work item to Doing

In this part, you assign a work item to yourself on Azure Boards that relates to this module. You also move the work item to the **Doing** state. In practice, you and your team would assign work items at the start of each sprint, or work iteration.

Assigning work in this way gives you a checklist to work from. It gives others on your team visibility into what you're working on and how much work is left. It also helps the team enforce Work in Progress (WIP) limits so that the team doesn't take on too much work at one time.

Recall that the team settled on these top issues for the current sprint.

> [!NOTE]
> Within an Azure DevOps organization, work items are numbered sequentially. In your project, the number that's assigned to each work item might not match what you see here.

Here you move the last item, *Provision a database in each environment* to the **Doing** column and assign yourself to the work item. *Provision a database in each environment* relates to provisioning the _Space Game_ web application and database using an Azure Resource Manager template and managing changes to the database schema in Azure Pipelines.

To set up the work item:

1. From Azure DevOps, navigate to **Boards** and then select **Boards** from the menu.

    ![Azure DevOps showing the Boards menu](../../shared/media/azure-devops-boards-menu.png)

1. From the *Provision a database in each environment* work item, click the down arrow at the bottom of the card. Then assign the work item to yourself.

1. Move the work item from the **To Do** to the **Doing** column.

    ![Azure Boards showing the card in the Doing column](../media/4-boards-2.png)

At the end of this module, you move the card to the **Done** column after you've completed the task.
