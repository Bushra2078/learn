Congratulations. You took the first step to incorporate a machine learning model into your UWP app. Now you should have a better understanding of why you might want to run model evaluations locally on your Windows 10 device instead of in the cloud. 

We reviewed these basics:
* Find or create a machine learning model.
* Export the model to the correct format. Or use WinMLTools to convert it if necessary. 
* Load the model in Visual Studio.
* Bind the inputs and outputs in your UWP app.
* Use the model to evaluate your input, a Windows InkCanvas drawing in our example.
