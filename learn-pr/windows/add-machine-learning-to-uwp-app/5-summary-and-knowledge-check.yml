quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Which of the following statements gives the most accurate reasons to perform evaluations locally with a machine learning model instead of in the cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can respond, reason, and act in real time and in areas with limited or no connectivity. The community of users can also continuous train the model with new images and tags to increase evaluation accuracy and intelligence over time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When you perform evaluations with a local model, you can respond, reason, and act in real time in areas with limited or no connectivity. But when you work with a local model offline, the community of users uploading and tagging more images can't continuous train the model. That training requires connecting with the model in the cloud."
    - content: "Windows ML support is built into all Windows 10 devices. That means machine learning models can be installed in any format. There's no risk of data loss from a damaged machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Windows ML is built into all Windows 10 devices. But machine learning models must be converted to ONNX format to be used for evaluation. To use a model that isn't in ONNX format, see [Convert ML models to ONNX with WinMLTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/ai/convert-model-winmltools). It's also not true that there's no risk of data loss from a damaged machine. Consider storage backup options if you collect local evaluation data."
    - content: "Local device evaluation provides fast, offline results. It also avoids the privacy or regulatory concerns that can be an obstacle when you move data to the cloud."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Certain scenarios might prohibit secure data from being sent to the cloud. An example is working in healthcare where HIPA laws prohibit sharing of sensitive patient data. In these cases, machine learning opens up new possibilities that aren’t available via the cloud. It performs local client-side evaluation quickly. There’s no need for a secure online connection. You don’t wait for data to make a roundtrip to the cloud. And there’s no potential obstacle of privacy release forms."

  - content: "Which file format do we recommend for using a machine learning model with a Windows 10 device?"
    choices:
    - content: "CoreML"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CoreML is Apple's machine learning framework for use with iOS apps. CoreML models can be converted for use with a Windows 10 device with WinMLTools. For help, see [Convert ML models to ONNX with WinMLTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/ai/convert-model-winmltools)."
    - content: "ONNX"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ONNX stands for the Open Neural Network Exchange. It's an open ecosystem for interchangeable, interoperable machine learning AI models. ONNX is supported by a community of partners, including Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and many more."
    - content: "Scikit-learn"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Scikit-learn is a Python machine learning library. Scikit-learn models can be converted for use with a Windows 10 device with WinMLTools. For help, see [Convert ML models to ONNX with WinMLTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/ai/convert-model-winmltools)."

  - content: "It can be a lot of work to massage the format of image files into the input type that the model expects. Windows ML abstracts that away by using this file format to pass images into models:"
    choices:
    - content: "JPG"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. It's too lossy. Convert it first. Try again."
    - content: "PNG"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Good guess. It's the most widely used lossless image format on the internet. But it's not standard enough. Convert it."
    - content: "ImageFeatureValue"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The ImageFeatureValue class abstracts away the need to choose one specific file format. It provides methods and properties to bind any image format after you convert it to a [VideoFrame](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.videoframe)."
    - content: "BMP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "We support Windows bitmaps, but no compression means BMPs can take up a lot of space. Convert it."
    - content: "VideoFrame"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Close. The [ImageFeatureValue class](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning.imagefeaturevalue) uses [VideoFrame](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.videoframe) as the media class to create the image. But it includes some binding methods and properties."

  - content: "Bonus Challenge! Select the only item in this list that is **not** a method for training a new Machine Learning model:"
    choices:
    - content: "QnA Maker, Azure Cognitive Services, to create rich knowledge resources that can be integrated into apps and services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "QnA Maker helps you build these things: 
      * Knowledge-enabled apps for extraction from unstructured text.
      * A knowledge base from a collection of Q&As.
      * A semantic matching knowledge base. 
      [Try QnA Maker](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/know/)."
    - content: "PyTorch framework for natural language processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PyTorch is another great way to train a new model both locally or in the cloud. For an example of how to train a model with PyTorch by using the MNIST dataset, see [Train a model with PyTorch](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/ai/train-model-pytorch)."
    - content: "Speech to Text, Azure Cognitive Services, to convert audio to text for natural responsiveness."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Speech to Text is one of several ways that Azure Cognitive Services makes training speech models easy. Check out the [speech processing](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/) of the Azure Cognitive Services site."
    - content: "Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit framework with Visual Studio Tools for AI to describe neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit framework is a great way to train a new model. For an example of how to train a new model with the MNIST dataset, see [Train a model with CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/ai/train-model-vs-tools-ai)."
    - content: "All of these choices are ways to train a new ML model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "All of the preceding choices are ways to create a machine learning model. Select each for a link to more information and help on how to use these services. Or see [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/)."
