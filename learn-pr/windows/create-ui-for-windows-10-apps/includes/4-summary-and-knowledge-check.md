In this module, you learned a lot about how to build a user interface in UWP and WPF applications. You use these foundational concepts throughout almost every Windows app you make:

1. How to use a layout control to position other elements in a user interface.
2. How to add items to your layout and edit their properties to customize your UI.
3. How to display information to, and accept input from, a user by using various input controls.

Now you can learn how to enhance your UI with more robust features. Examples are embedded media elements and smooth navigation between pages. You can take these skills to the next level and use more advanced platform features like data binding. These features make developing Windows 10 desktop applications productive and powerful.
