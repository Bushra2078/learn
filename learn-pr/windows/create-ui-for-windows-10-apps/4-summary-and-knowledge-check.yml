    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: What's the relationship between a parent and a child element?
      choices:
      - content: The parent element sets the properties of the child element.
        explanation: Certain parent elements might support different child elements. But the child's properties aren't set by the parent.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The child element is contained within the bounds of the parent element.
        explanation: Correct. This component is critical for the UI structure of Windows apps.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: The child element renders below the parent element.
        explanation: Child elements render on top of their parent elements.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Parent elements can only interact through their child elements.
        explanation: Many parent elements exist only to hold child elements. But they can still be accessed independently of their children.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: What determines the order in which child elements of the same parent element render in your app?
      choices:
      - content: Later elements render on top of earlier elements.
        explanation: Correct. Keep this relationship in mind when you create UIs.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: You must manually specify the rendering order of your elements to avoid errors.
        explanation: Elements have a default rendering order. They don't require manual instruction.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: All child elements of the same parent element render on the same layer. They can't cannot overlap.
        explanation: Child elements can overlap. And they render in a specific and consistent order.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Earlier elements render on top of later elements.
        explanation: There's an automatic rendering order. But this answer isn't it.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: When does the code inside an event handler run?
      choices:
      - content: When a user performs an action specified in the event handler.
        explanation: Event handlers don't define the circumstances in which they're run.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: When a UI behavior specified in the event handler occurs.
        explanation: Event handlers don't define the circumstances in which they're run.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: When a UI element notices a particular behavior occurring. And when the event handler has been assigned to that behavior.
        explanation: Correct. The triggering behavior is known as an **event**. Every control has a list of events to which handlers can be assigned.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: When a UI element notices a particular behavior occurring.
        explanation: This answer doesn't tell the whole story. A UI element still needs to know that a handler exists for that particular event.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: What does the odd syntax of SelectedMathFunction mean?
      choices:
      - content: SelectedMathFunction specifies which of the math functions to use.
        explanation: This answer is essentially what the function does. But it's not a good explanation for its syntax.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: SelectedMathFunction is a function that takes in two doubles and returns a double.
        explanation: The function doesn't directly do any math itself. It's a getter and a setter for a different function.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: SelectedMathFunction is an event handler for the `Radio` button.
        explanation: The `Radio` button has its own event handler that calls SelectedMathFunction.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: SelectedMathFunction gets and sets a function that takes in two doubles and returns a double.
        explanation: Correct. You might not have seen a function that takes or returns a function before. But this example can be a useful shortcut.
        isCorrect: true
