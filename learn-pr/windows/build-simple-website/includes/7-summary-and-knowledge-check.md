In this module, you've set up and customized a working environment for web development. You've also created a website and tested that everything is working in a browser. We've covered a lot of ground. Look at all you've accomplished! You have:

1. Downloaded and installed the tools you need for web development, and customized the editor with basic packages and configured Git.
2. Created a project directory, files, and set up Git tracking.
3. Created a heading, paragraph, and unordered list, and then linked to external files and tested the page in a browser.
4. Applied styles to different elements and tested your site in the browser.
5. Learned how to create a console message and add the date to the page.
6. Committed changes in the working directory.

We're gathering tools and building a foundation. It can be challenging to get started, but it will be easier next time. Remember you can reuse your website as a template for future projects. As your skills and knowledge grow, you'll be more able to fulfill the vision you have for your site. It's also empowering to see an idea come to life.
