# Considerations for setting up a WSL dev environment

There are several things to consider when setting up a development environment with WSL that we will look at briefly from a high-level perspective.

What do I need to consider when setting up a WSL environment?

    - Choosing a Linux distribution (Store, Import, and Create your own options)
    - High-level look at popular developer tools for Windows and Linux and how they work together (example workflow diagram incorporating Bash, NodeJS, VS Code, Docker, Git, and Microsoft Edge)
    - Why WSL is intended for CI/CD and not production
