Whether youâ€™re a seasoned developer or a student just beginning to learn code, one of the most important choices you need to make is the type of hardware, environment, and tools to invest in using.

As a developer, you will need to access specific coding tools, languages, and frameworks. You may want to install Python and a web development framework like Django, work with JavaScript on a NodeJS backend, or install a cross-platform project that uses React. Generally speaking, these programming languages will work on all operating systems. However, there are many scenarios that may prefer one operating system to another. Building Windows native desktop apps works best using Windows. Building a web app that will be deployed to a custom Linux server or production-ready Linux Virtual Machine (VM) works best using a Linux environment. We call this having parity between your local development environment and production deployment environment.

As the employee of a company, or a student in a school, access to productivity tools is also essential to consider. Throughout the day many of us need to use email and calendar scheduling tools (like Outlook), create Word docs, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations, and then need to jump on an online call or chat (using a tool like Microsoft Teams).

Rather than using separate machines to handle these needs, some developers choose to dual-boot or run virtual machines (VMs). Microsoft now offers a better solution with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). With WSL, you can run all of your favorite developer tools and productivity tools in one place, running Linux and Windows side-by-side!

## What is WSL?

WSL lets you install and run Linux distributions on Windows. This can be a bit confusing because Linux, like Windows, is also an operating system (OS)... so you're basically running two operating systems, integrated with one another.

## Dual-booting and Virtual Machines

In the past, running both Windows and Linux on one machine required you to install both operating systems separately and use a boot manager to choose which would run your computer during startup. There are some problems with this, like needing to restart your machine every time you wanted to switch between systems.

Virtual Machines (VM) are one way to address the pains of dual-booting two different operating systems. VMs enable you to run a virtualized instance of Linux on a device running Windows. The problem with VMs often relates to slower performance due to the amount of resources that need to be allocated to running the virtual instance, as well as a lack of integration between the two operating systems -- you're still running isolated separate systems.

WSL addresses these issues by integrating Windows and Linux with a much smaller resource footprint, requiring fewer resources (CPU, memory, storage) compared to traditional Virtual Machines. Run your favorite Windows office apps, dev tools, games, etc. right alongside your Linux development environment with incredibly fast and efficient performance speed.

## How it works - WSL architecture

WSL was initially launched in August 2016 (Windows 10 version 1607), using what is now referred to as the "WSL 1" architecture. WSL 1 runs as a translation layer, using a Linux kernel interface on top of the Windows kernel. You could think of WSL 1 as a compatibility layer that handles system call emulation for running Linux binaries in the Windows environment.

In May 2019, WSL 2 was announced, introducing important changes to the WSL architecture, such as using a real Linux kernel run through a subset of Hyper-V features. The WSL 2 architecture significantly improved performance speed, enabling a more immediate reaction to system calls, with fewer limitations. WSL 2 is now the default architecture used when installing a Linux distribution.

The current WSL architecture uses a custom-built Linux kernel. This custom Linux kernel includes a small init script in the startup process that forms the connections between Windows and Linux. The kernel is open-source and invites users to report bugs or request features.

The WSL architecture enables any Linux distribution to run on your Windows machine and supports running GUI apps (not just command line tools) if you follow the tutorial in the documentation to add the necessary drivers. The WSL architecture also now supports "SystemD", a Linux system and service manager that was missing from previous versions of WSL. Recent updates make WSL even more similar to running Linux distributions on a bare metal machine (without the Windows operating system).

## When to use WSL?

WSL is a versatile tool. It provides a great way to learn how to work with Linux tools, try different Linux distributions, or incorporate both Linux and Windows tools seamlessly into your professional workflow and development environment. WSL is designed for development and has specific issues to consider if you want to use it for production workloads, but is great for CI/CD pipelines. WSL can also be used in business enterprise settings, with the ability to create and distribute WSL images to machines used in your company, but with some specific security considerations to be aware of. We will cover this in future training modules and you can learn more in the documentation links at the end of this module.
