In this module, you learned how Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables you to install and run Linux distributions on your Windows 10 or Windows 11 device. You explored how to set up a seamlessly integrated development experience that doesn't require dual-boot or running a VM in order to use your favorite Windows and Linux tools.

You installed the default Ubuntu distribution of Linux from the Microsoft Store. You also learned how to install additional distributions, using Ubuntu for this and Kali for that, all with customized command prompts running side by side in Windows Terminal.

You learned how to list distributions available in the store, that you can import distributions that aren't in the store, or even build your own customized distribution.

You learned about different environments where WSL can be used, such as Windows Server or creating an image to distribute in your company or organization.

You tried some basic commands, intermixing Bash and PowerShell commands.

You learned a bit about working between the Windows and Linux file system, as well as what a standard WSL developer environment and workflow looks like.

While we didn't go in-depth, you should now be confident that WSL will enable you to use both your preferred command line tools and Graphic User Interface (GUI) apps, whether they're running on Windows or Linux.

Lastly, you learned that there are some great resources that go in to more depth on these topics available to meet your needs and interests. We've linked a few of them below.
