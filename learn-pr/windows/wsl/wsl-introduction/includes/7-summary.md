In this module, you learned how Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables you to install and run Linux distributions on your Windows 10 or Windows 11 device, providing a seamlessly integrated experience, so you don't have to dual-boot or run a VM in order to use your favorite Windows and Linux tools.

You installed the default Ubuntu distribution of Linux from the Microsoft Store and learned how to install additional distributions, using Ubuntu for this and Kali for that, all with customized command prompts running side-by-side in Windows Terminal. You learned how to list distributions available in the store, that you can import distributions that aren't in the store, or even build your own customized distribution and run it on Windows Server or create an image to distribute in your company or organization. You tried some basic commands, learning that you can intermix Bash and PowerShell commands. You learned a bit about moving between the Windows and Linux file system, as well as what a standard WSL developer environment and workflow looks like that enables you to use both preferred command line tools and Graphic User Interface (GUI) apps created for Windows or Linux. Lastly, you learned that there are some great resources that go in to more depth on these topics available to meet your needs and interests. We've linked a few of them below.
