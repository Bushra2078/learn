If you've followed through the previous lessons, you may think that data binding is too much hassle. Why go through all the trouble of implementing `INotifyPropertyChanged`, firing events left and right, when you could simply use `TimeTextBlock.Text = DateTime.Now.ToLongTime()` to display the time? And it's true, in this simple case, data binding does look like overkill.

However, data binding is capable of much more. It can transfer data in both directions between the UI and the code, display lists of items, and support the editing of data. All of this with an architecture that offers a clean separation of the data your app's logic works on, and the presentation of the data.

But how can we reduce the amount of code the developer has to write? Nobody wants to type 10 lines of code just to declare a simple property. Luckily, we can extract the common functionality, and bring down the property setters to just one line. This lesson shows you how.

### The goal

Our goal is to move all the plumbing for implementing the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface to a separate class, to simplify creating a property that can notify the UI when it changes. As a reminder, here's the code we want to simplify:

```cs
private bool _isNameNeeded = true;

public bool IsNameNeeded
{
    get { return _isNameNeeded; }
    set
    {
        if (value != _isNameNeeded)
        {
            _isNameNeeded = value;
            PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(IsNameNeeded)));
        }
    }
}
```

Automatic properties (such as `public bool IsNameNeeded { get; set;}`) can't be used here, because we need to do something in the setter. So, there's not much to be done about the backing field, the property declaration line. Using modern C# features, we could change the getter to `get => _isNameNeeded;`, but that only saves a few keystrokes. So, we need to focus our attention to the property setter. Can we turn that into a single line?

### The `ObservableObject` class

We can create a new base class: `ObservableObject`. It's called *observable* because it can be observed by the UI, by using the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface. The data and logic are hosted in classes that inherit from it, and the UI is also bound to instances of these inherited classes.

#### 1. Create the `ObservableObject` class

Let's create a new class called `ObservableObject`. Right-click the `DatabindingSample` project in **Solution Explorer**, select **Add / Class**, and enter `ObservableObject` as the class' name. Select **Add** to create the class.

#### 2. Implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface

Next, we have to implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface, and make our class public. Change the signature of the class so that it looks like this:

```cs
public class ObservableObject : INotifyPropertyChanged
```

Visual Studio indicates that there are several issues with `INotifyPropertyChanged`. It resides in a non-referenced namespace. Let's add it as shown here.

```cs
using System.ComponentModel;
```

Next, we have to implement the interface. Add this line inside the body of the class.

```cs
public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
```

#### 3. The `RaisePropertyChanged` method

In previous lessons, we have often raised the `PropertyChangedEvent` in our code, even outside of property setters. While modern C# and the [null-conditional operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-conditional-operators) or (`?.`) allowed us to do this in one line, we can still simplify by creating a convenience function like this:

```cs
protected void RaisePropertyChanged(string propertyName)
{
    PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
}
```

So now, in classes that inherit from `ObservableObject`, all we have to do to raise the `PropertyChanged` event is the following:

```cs
RaisePropertyChanged(nameof(MyProperty));
```

#### 4. The `Set<T>` method

But what can we do about the setter pattern that checks whether the value is the same as it was, sets the value if not, and raises the `PropertyChanged` event? Ideally, we'd like to turn it into a one-liner, like this:

```cs
private bool _isNameNeeded = true;

public bool IsNameNeeded
{
    get { return _isNameNeeded; }
    set { Set(ref _isNameNeeded, value); }  // Just one line!
}
```

It can't really get simpler than that. We call a function, pass a reference to the backing field of the property, and set the new value. So, what does this `Set` method look like?

```cs
protected bool Set<T>(
    ref T field,
    T newValue,
    [CallerMemberName] string propertyName = null)
{
    if (EqualityComparer<T>.Default.Equals(field, newValue))
    {
        return false;
    }

    field = newValue;
    RaisePropertyChanged(propertyName);
    return true;
}
```

Copy the preceding code into the body of the `ObservableObject` class. For `[CallerMemberName]`, you also need to add the following line to the top of the file:

```cs
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
```

There's a lot of advanced C# and compiler magic going on here. Let's take a closer look.

`Set<T>` is a generic method, helping the compiler to make sure that the backing field and the value are of the same type. The method's third parameter, the `propertyName`, is decorated by the `[CallerMemberName]` attribute. If we don't define the `propertyName` when calling the method, it will take the name of the calling member, and place it in there during compile time. So, if we call `Set` from the setter of the `IsNameNeeded` method, the compiler places the string literal, *"IsNameNeeded"*, as the third parameter. No need to hardcode strings or even use `nameof()`!

Next, the `Set` method invokes `EqualityComparer<T>.Default.Equals` to compare the field's current and new value. If the old and new values are equal, the `Set` method returns `false`. If not, the backing field is set to the new value, and the `PropertyChanged` event is raised before returning `true`. You can use the return value of the `Set` method to determine whether the value has changed.

With the `ObservableObject` class implemented, let's see how we can use it in our app!

#### 5. Create the `MainPageLogic` class

Earlier in this lesson, we moved all our data and logic out of the `MainPage` class, and into a class that inherits from `ObservableObject`.

Let's create a new class, called `MainPageLogic`. Right-click the `DatabindingSample` project in **Solution Explorer**, select **Add / Class**, and enter `MainPageLogic` as the class' name. Select **Add** to create the class.

Change the class' signature, so that it's public and inherits from `ObservableObject`.

```cs
public class MainPageLogic : ObservableObject
{
}
```

#### 6. Move the clock feature to the `MainPageLogic` class

The code for the clock feature consists of three parts: the `_timer` field, setting up the `DispatcherTimer` in the constructor, and the `CurrentTime` property. Here's the code as we've left it in the second lesson:

```cs
private DispatcherTimer _timer;

public MainPage()
{
    this.InitializeComponent();
    _timer = new DispatcherTimer { Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1) };

    _timer.Tick += (sender, o) =>
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(CurrentTime)));

    _timer.Start();
}

public string CurrentTime => DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString();
```

Let's move all of the code that has to do with the `_timer` to the `MainPageLogic` class. The lines in the constructor (except for the `this.InitializeComponent()` call) should be moved to the `MainPageLogic`'s constructor. From the preceding code, all that should be left in the `MainPage` is the `InitializeComponent` call in the constructor.

```cs
public MainPage()
{
    this.InitializeComponent();
}
```

For now, only touch this part of the code. We'll come back to the rest of the `MainPage` class' code soon.

After the move, the `MainPageLogic` class looks like this:

```cs
public class MainPageLogic : ObservableObject
{
    private DispatcherTimer _timer;

    public MainPageLogic()
    {
        _timer = new DispatcherTimer { Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1) };

        _timer.Tick += (sender, o) =>
            PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(CurrentTime)));

        _timer.Start();
    }

    public string CurrentTime => DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString();
}
```

Remember, we have a convenience function for raising the `PropertyChanged` event. Let's use that in the `_timer.Tick` handler.

```cs
_timer.Tick += (sender, o) => RaisePropertyChanged(nameof(CurrentTime));
```

#### 7. Change the XAML to use the `MainPageLogic`

If you try to compile the project now, you'll get an error saying that "Property 'CurrentTime' can't be found on type 'MainPage'" in MainPage.xaml. And sure enough, the `MainPage` class no longer has a `CurrentTime` property. It's been moved to the `MainPageLogic` class. To fix this, we'll create a property called `Logic` in the `MainPage` class. This will be of type `MainPageLogic`, and we'll do all our bindings through this.

Add the following to the `MainPage` class:

```cs
public MainPageLogic Logic { get; } = new MainPageLogic();
```

Next, in MainPage.xaml, find the `TextBlock` that displays the clock.

```xml
<TextBlock Text="{x:Bind CurrentTime, Mode=OneWay}"
           HorizontalAlignment="Right"
           Margin="10"/>
```

And change the binding by adding `Logic.` to it.

```xml
<TextBlock Text="{x:Bind Logic.CurrentTime, Mode=OneWay}"
           HorizontalAlignment="Right"
           Margin="10"/>
```

Now the app compiles, and if you run it, the clock is ticking as it should. Nice!

#### 8. Move the rest of the logic

Let's pick up the pace. Move the rest of the code in the `MainPage` class to `MainPageLogic`. All that should be left is the `Logic` property, the constructor, and the `PropertyChanged` event.

#### 9. Simplify `IsNameNeeded`

In MainPageLogic.cs, replace the `IsNameNeeded` property setter with a call to our new `Set` method.

```cs
public bool IsNameNeeded
{
    get { return _isNameNeeded; }
    set { Set(ref _isNameNeeded, value); }
}
```

#### 10. Fix the `OnSubmitClicked` method

At the logic level, we no longer care about the button click event's sender or event args. It's also a good practice to reconsider the name of the method. We no longer do button clicks, we do submit logic. So, let's rename the `OnSubmitClicked` method to `Submit`, make it public, and remove the parameters.

Inside the method, there's our old way of raising the `PropertyChanged` event. Replace it with a call to `ObservableObject.RaisePropertyChanged`. In the end, the whole method should look like this:

```cs
public void Submit()
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(UserName))
    {
        return;
    }

    IsNameNeeded = false;
    RaisePropertyChanged(nameof(GetGreetingVisibility));
}
```

#### 11. Change the XAML to refer to the `Logic`

Next, head back to MainPage.xaml, and change the remaining bindings to go through the `Logic` property. When all's done, the `Grid` should look like this:

```xml
<Grid>
    <TextBlock Text="{x:Bind Logic.CurrentTime, Mode=OneWay}"
               HorizontalAlignment="Right"
               Margin="10"/>

    <StackPanel HorizontalAlignment="Center"
                VerticalAlignment="Center"
                Orientation="Horizontal"
                Visibility="{x:Bind Logic.IsNameNeeded, Mode=OneWay}">
        <TextBlock Margin="10"
                   VerticalAlignment="Center"
                   Text="Enter your name: "/>
        <TextBox Name="tbUserName"
                 Margin="10"
                 Width="150"
                 VerticalAlignment="Center"
                 Text="{x:Bind Logic.UserName, Mode=TwoWay}"/>
        <Button Margin="10"
                VerticalAlignment="Center"
                Click="{x:Bind Logic.Submit}" >Submit</Button>
    </StackPanel>

    <TextBlock Text="{x:Bind sys:String.Format('Hello {0}!',  tbUserName.Text), Mode=OneWay}"
               Visibility="{x:Bind Logic.GetGreetingVisibility(), Mode=OneWay}"
               HorizontalAlignment="Left"
               VerticalAlignment="Top"
               Margin="10"/>
</Grid>
```

Note how even the `Button.Click` event could be bound to the `Submit` method in the `MainPageLogic` class.

If you compile the project now, you still get a warning that says that the `MainPage.PropertyChanged` is never used.

#### 12. Tidy up the `MainPage` class

The warning occurs because we no longer need the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface on the `MainPage` class. So, let's remove it from the class declaration, along with the `PropertyChanged` event.

In the end, the entire `MainPage` class looks like this:

```cs
public sealed partial class MainPage : Page
{
    public MainPageLogic Logic { get; } = new MainPageLogic();

    public MainPage()
    {
        this.InitializeComponent();
    }

}
```

This is as clean as it gets.

#### 13. Run the app

If all went well, you should be able to run the app at this point, and verify that it works exactly as it did earlier. Congratulations!

### Summary
So, what did we achieve with all this work? While the app works the same as before, we've arrived at a scalable, sustainable, and testable architecture.

The `MainPage` class is now very simple. It contains a reference to the logic, and simply receives and forwards a button click event. All the data flow between the logic and the UI happens through data binding, which is fast, robust, and proven.

The `MainPageLogic` class is now UI-agnostic. It doesn't matter whether the clock is displayed in a `TextBlock` or some other control. The form submission can happen in any number of ways. These ways include a button click, a press of the Enter key, or a face recognition algorithm detecting a smile. The form can also be submitted by using automatic unit tests that target the logic and ensure it works according to the project's requirements.

For these reasons, as well as others, it's a good practice to only have UI-related features in the page's codebehind, and separate the logic in a different class. More complicated apps may also have animation control and other, concrete UI-related features. As you work with more complicated apps, you'll appreciate the separation of UI and logic that we've created in this lesson.

You can re-use the `ObservableObject` class in your own project. After a bit of practice, you'll find that it is actually faster and easier to approach problems this way. Or take advantage of an existing, well established library, such as [MVVM Light](http://www.mvvmlight.net/), that follows and builds upon the principles you learned in this module.

#### 5. Modify the `Clock` class to take advantage of `ObservableObject`

Change the signature of `Clock`, so that it inherits from `ObservableObject` instead of `INotifyPropertyChanged`.

```cs
public class Clock : ObservableObject
```

Now we have the `PropertyChanged` event defined in both the `Clock` class and its base class, which results in a compiler warning. Delete the `PropertyChanged` event from the `Clock` class.

To raise the `PropertyChanged` event, we've created a convenience function in the `ObservableObject` class. To use it, replace the `_timer.Tick` line with this:

```cs
_timer.Tick += (sender, o) => RaisePropertyChanged(nameof(CurrentTime));
```

The `Clock` class has already became simpler. But let's see what we can do with the more complex `MainWindowDataContext` class.

#### 6. Modify the `MainWindowDataContext` class to take advantage of `ObservableObject`

As with the `Clock` class, we again start by changing the class declaration so that it inherits from `ObservableObject`.

```cs
public class MainWindowDataContext : ObservableObject
```

Make sure you delete the `PropertyChanged` event here, too.

Take a look at the setter of the `IsNameNeeded` property. This is what it looks now:

```cs
set
{
    if (value != _isNameNeeded)
    {
        _isNameNeeded = value;
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(
            this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(IsNameNeeded)));
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(
            this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(GreetingVisibility)));
    }
}
```

This is the standard `INotifyPropertyChanged` pattern, with the extra `PropertyChanged` event invocation if the new `IsNameNeeded` property value is different.

This is exactly the situation the `ObservableObject.Set` function was created for. The `Set` function even returns a `bool` value indicating whether the old and new values of the property are different. So, the above property setter can be simplified like this:

```cs
if (Set(ref _isNameNeeded, value))
{
    RaisePropertyChanged(nameof(GreetingVisibility));
}
```

Not bad!

#### 7. Run the app

If all went well, you should be able to run the app at this point, and verify that it works exactly as it did earlier. Congratulations!
