    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: How long are user activities kept in Windows 10 Timeline?
      choices:
      - content: Two weeks 
        explanation: Incorrect. That's a bit short.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: One month
        explanation: Correct. Many of us want to pick up tasks we started within a month.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: A custom length of time the user can set.
        explanation: Incorrect. The length of time can't be customized.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: What type of ActivationKind do we pick up on in the OnActivated method to recall the user activity?
      choices:
      - content: ActivationKind.Protocol
        explanation: Correct. This activation is when a Timeline entry is selected.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: ActivationKind.Launch
        explanation: Incorrect. This activation is used when the user selects the app or a content file.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: ActivationKind.ProtocolForResult
        explanation: Incorrect. This activation is used when an app is launched by another app, but with the expectation that a result is returned to the caller.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: What is a key component of the protocol declarations in the tutorial?
      choices:
      - content: The mime type of the user activity is set to "application/octet-stream"--an application.
        explanation: Incorrect. It's good practice to set mime types, but it doesn't connect the app with Timeline activation.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The ActivationUrl must match the name in the protocol setting in the manifest file.
        explanation: Correct. 
        isCorrect: true
      - content: A background image must be set on the adaptive card used by Timeline.
        explanation: Incorrect. But it's also a good practice.
        isCorrect: false
