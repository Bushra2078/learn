In the last unit, we created a simple, autogenerated HTML file named index.html. Let's pick up where we left off and make a web app we can run on a local server.

## First test: Hello World

For a first test to see the minimal code we can run, add some content to display. When we left our new index.html file in the last unit, it looked like the following.

Now edit this code to look like the following screenshot.

Notice how the HTML IntelliSense and color coding extensions are working for you. You might explore the extensions more in future modules, but feel free to go ahead and experiment on your own. If you do, be sure that you also try the autocompletion features.

## Publish the web page locally

Now it's time to run the HTML locally. Select the **GoLive** icon in the bottom right status bar.

This action tells the Live Server extension that we installed earlier to start up and launch your default web browser to serve up the content in the current file. You should see **Hello World Test Page** in the browser's title bar and **Hello, World!** in a large heading font.

Congratulations! You have served up your first web page. Only you can see this content, because it's on a locally running web server. The web address is the IP address reserved for the local machine. If you want this web page to be available online, you need to deploy it to a web server connected to the internet. If you like, you can learn about it in other modules in this series.
