Visual Studio Code is an open source, lightweight, and full-featured text editor that supports a multitude of extensions for all kinds of developers. If you're getting started in the larger world of web development, Visual Studio Code can be a valuable tool. Features such as build scripts, environments, debugging, and more, combined with its role of powerful text editor, are of particular value to new developers. Visual Studio Code handles all of these features in one environment without the traditionally heavy integrated development environment (IDE).

Visual Studio Code is built on a platform called Electron, and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. This learning module is as platform-independent as possible. Though some screenshots might be from specific platforms, the information should transfer to any platform with some minor adaptation.

Here's a list of some of Visual Studio Code's key features:

- Lightweight
- Multiplatform
- Color coding
- Built-in debugger
- Integrated terminal
- Integrated git support
- IntelliSense with autocomplete
- Open source
- Extensible

In this module, you learn how to install and use Visual Studio Code with some basic web development extensions, then use these features to make a basic web application. Even if you have never written a web app, you can still be successful with this module. And if you're an experienced web developer, you can still learn many useful things here to get you started with Visual Studio Code.
