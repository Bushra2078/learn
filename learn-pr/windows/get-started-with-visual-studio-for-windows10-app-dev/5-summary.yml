    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: In Visual Studio, what does a *solution* consist of?
      choices:
      - content: A solution contains a single project and its related resources.
        explanation: Incorrect.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: A solution and a project are the same thing.
        explanation: Incorrect.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: A solution contains one or more projects.
        explanation: Correct! Those projects might each contain their own resources, or they might share resources.
        isCorrect: true
    - content: Which Visual Studio feature do we recommend using first when you debug your apps?
      choices:
      - content: Set breakpoints in your code, and inspect the values of variables at those breakpoints.
        explanation: Breakpoints will pause your app. They're a great way to start debugging.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: Automatically add print statements to your code.
        explanation: Print statements should only be used in the most basic debugging cases. Visual Studio doesn't automate them.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Step line by line through your code.
        explanation: This is a useful debugging feature, but it doesn't make sense to use it first.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: How is NuGet used in Windows app development?
      choices:
      - content: NuGet is a type of almond-based confectionery, used for snacking.
        explanation: You're just choosing this option to see what we'll say, aren't you?
        isCorrect: false
      - content: NuGet allows you to browse the package catalog and incorporate external packages in your UWP and .NET applications.
        explanation: Correct! NuGet is the package manager in Visual Studio.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: NuGet helps you install and update the essentials for UWP and .NET development.
        explanation: NuGet helps you install useful features, but isn't essential for developing Windows apps.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: Can Visual Studio interact directly with GitHub?
      choices:
      - content: Yes. Team Explorer lets you directly clone a project, and it provides other version control features.
        explanation: Correct! Team Explorer helps you keep all your version control work in one place.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: No. Visual Studio supports only Visual Studio Online.
        explanation: Visual Studio isn't picky about which service you use to store your code online.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: No. You can use Visual Studio on code you download from GitHub, but there's no direct support.
        explanation: Visual Studio does provide innate version control support.
        isCorrect: false
