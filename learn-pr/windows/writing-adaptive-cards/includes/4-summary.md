You've completed an app that demonstrates all the main features of Adaptive Cards:

- Column layout
- User input
- Actions
- Video
- Fact sets
- Image sets

You've also written and tested code that shows how to use the three actions for Adaptive Cards: *Open URL*, *Submit* and *Show Card*. These three actions enable user engagement. Given what you know now, you should have some ideas in mind for productive uses of Adaptive Cards.

After you complete the knowledge check, the next stage is to use Adaptive Cards in real-world scenarios, including in Windows 10 Timeline.
