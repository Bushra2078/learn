    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: How did the first app interact with Azure Cognitive Services?
      choices:
      - content: The app embedded a Bing-enabled search bar inside its UI.
        explanation: Although the app did use Bing, it didn't embed a search bar or a web view in its simple UI.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The app sent text to Azure Machine Learning and retrieved an image associated with that text.
        explanation: Incorrect. Machine Learning wasn't directly used in this app.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The first app didn't interact with Azure Cognitive Services.
        explanation: Incorrect. The app uses Bing features that are part of Azure Cognitive Services.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The app sent text to Bing Image Search and retrieved a response that contained an image's URL.
        explanation: Correct! This is a great example of using an API to help your app process user input.
        isCorrect: true
    - content: What is JSON, and how is it used?
      choices:
      - content: JSON is an encrypted format for sharing data. Specific libraries are needed to read or write JSON files.
        explanation: Incorrect. JSON isn't encrypted, and libraries aren't required to work with it (although they make it a lot easier!).
        isCorrect: false
      - content: JSON is a text-based format for sharing data between apps and services. Libraries can make working with JSON easier.
        explanation: Correct! In this module, we received a JSON result from external APIs and used a library to work with them.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: JSON is an image-encoding format that can include metadata.
        explanation: Incorrect. JSON is a text format. In this module, the JSON results we worked with contained a URL link to an image, but didn't encode the image itself.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: In the Astronomy Picture of the Day app, which task was made easier by modern features in the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) version?
      choices:
      - content: Async operations.
        explanation: Incorrect. The basic async operation structure is the same in all three versions of the app.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Saving and loading settings.
        explanation: Correct! APIs available in UWP let settings be loaded and saved without creating an initialization file.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: UI Design.
        explanation: Incorrect. Although UWP does provide modern UI features, there was no significant difference in this app between the UI of the UWP and WPF versions.
        isCorrect: false
