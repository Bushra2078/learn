> To work properly, these installation scripts require the Microsoft Edge web browser.

## What the script installs

Just in case you're curious, the script installs the following tools:

* Visual Studio 2017 Community edition
* Visual Studio Code
* Git
* The Visual Studio Azure workload
* The Visual Studio UWP workload
* The Visual Studio Managed desktop workload
* The Visual Studio Native desktop workload
* Windows Template Studio
* GitHub UWP samples

The script also turns on Developer Mode on Windows 10.

## If the script doesn't work

If something doesn't work, or you'd rather install the tools yourself, see the next unit to learn how to install the tools manually.
