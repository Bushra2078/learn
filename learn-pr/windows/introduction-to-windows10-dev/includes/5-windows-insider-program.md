The Windows Insider Program is a free service that provides prerelease access to the latest builds of Windows 10 and development SDKs. Through the Program, you can test upcoming Windows 10 features and APIs before they're released to the public, and you can keep up to date with the latest in Windows development.

## Join the Windows Insider Program

To join and register for the Windows Insider Program, you need a Microsoft account.

1. In the **Settings** app, select **Update & Security**, and then select **Windows Insider Program**. 
1. Select **Get started**.

If you've already registered for the Windows Insider Program, you still need to sign in to the registered Microsoft account to receive prerelease builds of Windows on a new computer.

## Install preview builds

After your registration and sign-in are complete, you're prompted to choose the prerelease content and release pace that fits your needs. These options can be changed later if your requirements change.

We recommend that developers select **Active development of Windows** as their content type.

If you're unfamiliar with working on prerelease builds, we recommend that you choose **Windows Insider Slow** as the pace. This will ensure access to prerelease features with minimal disruption to your computer.

After you've chosen your content type and pace, read and accept the privacy statement and the program agreement. Microsoft collects information from computers that run the Windows Insider Program. The company uses this information to help identify issues and improve the user experience of prerelease Windows builds before they're released to the general public.
