Congratulations, you have successfully enabled Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and explored the various tools, workflows, and ways of integrating with Windows. You should now have a better understanding of how to move seamlessly between the Linux and Windows file systems, using the tools you love on both platforms to establish your ideal development workflow. 

We reviewed the basics of how to enable WSL, install a Linux distribution, move between file systems, integrate Linux and Windows commands and tools, use VS Code to debug a Node.js Express app running inside your Linux distribution, and manage multiple Linux distributions running at the same time.
