    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: What UI element property is checked for and used by the Narrator first?
      choices:
      - content: x:Name

      - content: Content
        explanation: This property is used, but not as a first choice.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: AutomationPropertes.HelpText
        explanation: This property is spoken, but not as the name of the UI element.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: AutomationProperties.Name
        explanation: Correct. It's good practice to enter a natural-sounding name for this property.
        isCorrect: true
    - content: What two permissions need to be set for voice recognition to work?
      choices:
      - content: Microphone and speech recognition.
        explanation: Correct. Microphone and speech recognition permissions are both necessary for custom voice recognition.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: Microphone and two-factor authentication.
        explanation: One of these permissions is necessary, but the other isn't.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Protocol and speech recognition.
        explanation: One of these permissions is necessary, but the other isn't.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Accessibility and speech synthesis.
        explanation: Neither of these are permissions that need to be set.
        isCorrect: false
    - content: What happens when you clearly say, without pauses, "three times twenty equals" to the Windows speech recognition tool, with the calculator in focus?
      choices:
      - content: The calculator display shows "3 * 20".
        explanation: This doesn't map to a button.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The calculator display shows "60".
        explanation: Even with pauses this shouldn't happen, as "20" won't be mapped to a button.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The calculator display shows "3".
        explanation: This might happen if you pause after saying "3".
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The speech recognition tool shows "What was that".
        explanation: This is the most likely outcome if you speak without pauses.
        isCorrect: true
    - content: What happens when you clearly say, without pauses, "three times twenty equals" to the calculator's custom speech recognition tool?
      choices:
      - content: The calculator display shows "3 * 20".
        explanation: This would be shown if "equals" wasn't included in the input.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The calculator display shows "60".
        explanation: Correct!
        isCorrect: true
      - content: The calculator display shows nothing.
        explanation: This shouldn't happen if the setup is correct and the input is clear.

      - content:  The calculator display shows "3 times".
        explanation: This shouldn't happen if all the input is clear.
