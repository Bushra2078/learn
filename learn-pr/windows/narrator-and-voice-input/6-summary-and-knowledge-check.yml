    title: Knowledge check
    questions:

      choices:

        explanation: This property is spoken, but not as the name of the UI element.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: AutomationProperties.Name

    - content: What two permissions need to be set for voice recognition to work?
      choices:
      - content: Microphone and speech recognition.

        isCorrect: true
      - content: Microphone and two-factor authentication.
        explanation: One of these permissions is necessary, but the other isn't.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Protocol and speech recognition.
        explanation: One of these permissions is necessary, but the other isn't.

        isCorrect: false
    - content: What happens when you clearly say, without pauses, "three times twenty equals" to the Windows speech recognition tool, with the calculator in focus?
      choices:
      - content: The calculator display shows "3 * 20".
        explanation: This entry doesn't map to a button.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The calculator display shows "60".
        explanation: Even with pauses this result shouldn't happen, as "20" won't be mapped to a button.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The calculator display shows "3".
        explanation: This result might happen if you pause after saying "3".
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The speech recognition tool shows "What was that".
        explanation: This outcome is the most likely if you speak without pauses.
        isCorrect: true
    - content: What happens when you clearly say, without pauses, "three times twenty equals" to the calculator's custom speech recognition tool?
      choices:

        explanation: This result would be shown if "equals" wasn't included in the input.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: The calculator display shows "60".
        explanation: Correct!
        isCorrect: true
