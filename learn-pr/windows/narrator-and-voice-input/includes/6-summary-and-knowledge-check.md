In this module, you've learned how to help the Windows Narrator provide descriptions of your UI elements, and how to add a speech recognition system that works with your specific app.

Visual presentation of your app is another fundamental part of an inclusive experience. If you haven't already, we highly encourage you to check out our module on inclusivity through keyboard navigation and color and high contrast settings.

Of course, there's always more to do with inclusivity. We haven't addressed hearing impairment, nor addressed some severe impairments such as mental illness. But hopefully, this module has given you a good start when it comes to adding accessibility to your app, and you're now encouraged to design with it in mind.

It can't be over-stressed that your app is only genuinely inclusive if it has been tested and found usable by users with the impairments you are trying to address. No number of tools or good advice can compare with such valuable feedback. Hopefully, this module will give you some ideas, processes and introduction to Windows tools that will assist you in getting going with making your apps genuinely inclusive.
