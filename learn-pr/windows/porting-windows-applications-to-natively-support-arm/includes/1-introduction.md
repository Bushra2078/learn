Arm-based devices are experiencing an increase in popularity. While Windows supports emulation so that applications with an x64 or x86-based architecture will still run on Arm devices, providing an Arm-native build of your Windows application will improve performance and give your customers the best experience when using an Arm-based device. In this module, we will cover some of the benefits of Arm, the support and toolchain available for Windows on Arm, and then walk through how to add an Arm64 build configuration for your Windows app, including testing, debugging, and troubleshooting.

## Scenario

Suppose you are a developer for a company with a popular Windows accounting application. The application's usage analytics show an increase in Windows on Arm devices using the application. You want to ensure that the application is running at peak performance on all platforms; to do this, you will work towards providing an Arm-native build.

  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

  1. Describe Windows on Arm.
  1. Understand why providing an Arm-native build for Windows applications is important.
  1. Configure an Arm64 build using Visual Studio.
  1. Test an Arm64 build on an Arm virtual machine.
  1. Debug an Arm64 build using Visual Studio remote debugging.
  1. Troubleshoot common issues experienced with Arm builds.
