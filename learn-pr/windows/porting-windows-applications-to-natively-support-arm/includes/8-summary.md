In this module, you learned that Arm-based devices are becoming increasingly popular due to their long battery life, best-in-class connectivity, and impressive processing power. Therefore, porting existing Windows applications to run natively on this rapidly growing platform makes sense. You learned that providing an Arm-native build of a Windows application offers your end users the best performance and experience. You performed exercises demonstrating step-by-step how to add an Arm64 build to a Windows application, testing, and debugging the application on a Windows on Arm virtual machine. Finally, you learned some obstacles you might encounter when porting your applications to Arm and some valuable strategies to apply to achieve the goal of a 100% Arm-native application version.
