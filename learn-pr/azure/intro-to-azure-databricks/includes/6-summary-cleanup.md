In this module we learned about the basics of using Databricks workspace and Apache Spark notebooks. The notebooks allow you to interactively work with different types of data. You can use notebooks for a wide variety of day-to-day data handling such as, processing huge data files, querying, reading and writing data from different sources, and processing live data streams.  

## Cleanup 

If you plan on completing other Azure Databricks modules, do not delete your Azure Databricks instance just yet. You will be able to use the same environment for the other modules.

### Delete the Azure Databricks instance

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal.
2. Navigate to the Resource Group that contains your Azure Databricks instance.
3. Select **Delete resource group**.
4. Type the name of the resource group in the confirmation text box.
5. Select **Delete**.
