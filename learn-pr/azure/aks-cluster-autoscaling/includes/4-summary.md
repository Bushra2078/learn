Your company is experiencing increased demand for its video rendering service because of its international expansion. They have already found a way to scale the application, but the cluster wasn't keeping up with the demand. You want to understand how to use the cluster autoscaler to do it without too many changes in your infrastructure.

By using the AKS cluster autoscaler feature, you were able to automatically scale up and down the number of nodes in your cluster. You configured the cluster autoscaler to watch for unscheduled pods with resource constraints, and it automatically increased and decreased the number of nodes in a cluster to meet those requirements. You've see how the feature could allow your company to keep up with application scalability and transparently serve the users of your company's website.

## Clean up resources

In this module, you created resources by using your Azure subscription. The following steps show you how to clean up these resources so that there's no continued charge against your account.

1. Open the Azure portal.

    > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
    > [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true)

1. Select **Resource groups** in the left-hand menu.

1. Find the **learn-aks-cluster-scalability** resource group, or the resource group name you used, and select it.

1. On the **Overview** tab of the resource group, select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter the name of the resource group to confirm. Select **Delete** to delete all of the resources you created in this module.

1. Also, delete the **MC_learn-aks-cluster-scalability_learn-aks-cluster-scalability_eastus** resource group to remove all AKS-related resources.

1. Finally, run the `kubectl config delete-context` command to remove the deleted clusters context. Here's an example of the complete command. Remember to replace the name of the cluster with your cluster's name.

    ```bash
    kubectl config delete-context learn-aks-cluster-scalability
    ```

    If successful, the command returns the following example output.

    ```output
    deleted context learn-aks-cluster-scalability from /home/user/.kube/config
    ```
