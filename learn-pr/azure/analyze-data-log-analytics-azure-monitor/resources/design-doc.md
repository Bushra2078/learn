## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Log Analytics
- Azure Monitor

## Prerequisites

- Experience using the Azure portal for accessing and creating resources
- Knowledge of Azure virtual machines
- Basic familiarity with SQL query language

## Summary

Assess Log Analytics and Azure Monitor. Deploy Log Analytics workspace. Enable Log Analytics extension on Azure virtual machines. Configure diagnostic settings for Azure VMs. Monitor performance of virtual machines using Log Analytics queries and create alerts. Save results of queries to a dashboard and interpret graphical representations of data extracted from queries. 

## Learning objectives

1. Describe relationship between Azure Monitor and Log Analytics
1. Create Log Analytics workspace, configure with right access permissions, and decide upon resource-centric or workspace-centric model for deployment
1. Write queries, set up alerts from queries, and configure diagnostic settings for Azure virtual machines
1. Save queries to dashboards and interpret graphs of extracted data

1. **Introduction**

A financial services firm is building more workloads and applications in Azure, versus building on-premises. Alerting and trend analysis have become increasingly difficult as the management team won't approve moving the on-premises monitoring environment to Azure because of licensing costs. Additionally, the environments being built in Azure are a mixture of IaaS and PaaS resources. Even if the on-premises monitoring environment could be moved, it couldn't monitor PaaS resources. The operations team is exploring Azure Monitor and Log Analytics as cloud native tools for their Azure Resources.
