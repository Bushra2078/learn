## Summary

A large financial services firm is building more workloads and applications in Azure, versus building on-premises. Alerting and trend analysis have become increasingly difficult as the management team will not sign off on moving the on-premises monitoring environment to Azure due to licensing costs. Additionally, the environments being built in Azure are a mixture of IaaS and PaaS resources, so even if the on-premises environment could be moved, it would not be able to monitor PaaS resources. The operations team is exploring using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics as a set of cloud native set of tools for monitoring deployed resources in Azure.

A big driver behind picking a monitoring solution for both IaaS and PaaS resources is the operations team needs to understand any issues that may be affecting production in real time, along with understanding performance and trends over time. Resources in Azure generate a lot of log data, so leaning on Azure Monitor and Log Analytics will allow the team to collect granular performance and utilization data, activity and diagnostics logs, and configure notifications from Azure resources in a consistent manner.

In this module, you will learn how to configure and interpret metrics, configure Log Analytics, and write queries that analyze logs so you cangit  fulfill monitoring needs of a cloud based environment.

## Learning objectives
