Search to become a key concept of modern everyday life because of the explosion of data people need to interactive. <!-- REVIEW What happened there? --> It's something every single one of us do every day, why should that be any different for your organization's digital assets or for your customers? Azure Search is a private enterprise search solution that allows your organization to combine its searchable content into a single fast index. The index can then be used for internal only use, or to enable searchable content on your public facing internet assets.

The company is just getting started establishing an online presence and you've been asked to provide a searchable index of your companies video catalog.
