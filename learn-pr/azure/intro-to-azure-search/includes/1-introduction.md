Search as a concept is a key part of modern everyday life. It's something every single one of us do on a daily basis, why should that be any different for your organisation's digital assets or for your customers? Azure Search is a private enterprise search solution allowing your organisation to consolidate it's searchable content into a single fast index whether that be for internal only use or to enable searchable content on your public internet facing assets for your customers.

Suppose you work for a fitness startup that publishes exercise videos. You're just getting started establishing your online presence and want to provide a searchable index of your video catalog. You have a number of videos in the catalog and want to search across a number of different properties, such as title, difficulty, length, and publication date.
