  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What is a suggester in Azure Search?'
    choices:
    - content: An element within a field for assigning attributes 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A suggester is not an element for assigning attributes, this is not the correct terminology. Suggesters are used on individual fields but do not assign attributes.
    - content: A construct supporting "search-as-you-type"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A suggester is a construct in an Azure Search index that supports a search-as-you-type or autocomplete experience. It contains a list of fields for which you want to enable for typeahead query inputs.
    - content: An AI feature providing suggestions to improve the index
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Whilst suggesters are an AI feature as such they are not for providing suggestions to improve the quality of the index.
    - content: A type of index attribute to filter data
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Suggesters are an attribute of an index in Azure Search but are not used to filter data.

  - content: 'Which of the following data sources can be used as an input data source?'
    choices:
    - content: Azure Data Lake 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Data Lake is not a supported external data source. It is however entirely possible to write code to use the REST API and push data from Azure Data Lake to Azure Search.
    - content: Azure Virtual Machines
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Virtual Machines are not a supported data source. SQL Server installed on a virtual machine is a supported source however.
    - content: Azure SQL Database
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure SQL Database is one of the supported external data sources in Azure Search. Azure SQL Database has a built in indexer ready made for Azure Search.
    - content: Azure Queue Storage
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Queue Storage is not supported. Only Blob and Table Storage are supported external sources within Azure Storage.

  - content: 'What condition would result in an index rebuild?'
    choices:
    - content: Adding a new field to the index
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Adding fields to an Azure search index do not require the index to be rebuilt. The index would only require a refresh.
    - content: Adding a scoring profile to the index
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Adding, updating or deleting scoring profiles in an index do not require the index to be rebuilt. They simply set an attribute to determine the location of the data in the result set.
    - content: Running a data refresh for the index
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Running a data refresh is different to rebuilding an index. Data refresh simply updates the data stored in the index from the data source rather than changing a material element of the physical structure.
    - content: Changing an index field definition
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Changing field definitions of an index are a material change to the physical index structure, as such the index will need to be rebuilt to reflect the changes.
