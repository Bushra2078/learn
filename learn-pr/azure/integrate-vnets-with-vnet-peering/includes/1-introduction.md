Imagine you're the Solution Architect for an engineering company that has been migrating existing services into Azure. The company has deployed services into separate virtual networks (VNets), but has not configured any private connectivity between them. Several business units have identified services that exist in these VNets that need to communicate with each other. You need to enable this connectivity but you don't want to expose these services to the internet and would like to minimize integration complexity.

In this module, you'll learn about the different VNet connection options and why VNet peering is suited to this scenario. You'll create three virtual networks and configure VNet peering between them. You'll then test that your configuration meets your connectivity goals.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify the different use-cases for VNet peering
- Identify the features and limitations of VNet peering
- Configure peering connections between the virtual networks
