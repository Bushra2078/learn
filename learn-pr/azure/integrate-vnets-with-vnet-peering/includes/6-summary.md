In this module, you learned how to use VNet peering connections to connect virtual networks using a hub and spoke network topology. You used VMs and SSH to verify connectivity between VNets using peering connections. These peering connections will further enable communication for services running on the VMs.

Now that you understand how to peer VNets together, you can use this minimally complex and cost effective method in your Azure network infrastructure. It enables low latency communication between resources in VNets, and supports scenarios where resources are in different regions or subscriptions. VNet peering should be your first choice for connecting VNets together.
