# 4 Train your first deep learning model using PyTorch and Jupyter

Typically deep learning engineers don't hard code matrix algebra operations all by hand. They instead use frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. 

PyTorch is a python based framewok that provides flexibility as a deep learning development platform. PyTorch's workflow is built on top of python scientific computing library numpy.

Now you might ask, why would we use PyTorch to build deep learning models? 

- Easy to use API – It is as simple as python can be.

- Python support – PyTorch smoothly integrates with the scientific computing stack.

- Dynamic computation graphs – Instead of predefined graphs with specific functionalities, PyTorch build computational graphs dynamically that can be modified during runtime. This is valuable for nested batching and when one a developer doesn't know how memory is going to be needed for creating a network.
