[Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/azure-stack/) portfolio is an extension of Azure that enables customers to build and run hybrid applications across on-premises, edge locations, and cloud. Azure Stack includes Azure Stack Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI), Azure Stack Hub (previously Azure Stack), and Azure Stack Edge (previously Azure Data Box Edge). The last two components (Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge) are discussed in this module.

Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge represent key enabling technologies that allow customers to process highly sensitive data using a private or hybrid cloud and pursue digital transformation using Microsoft [intelligent cloud and intelligent edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/future-of-cloud/) approach. For many government customers, enforcing data sovereignty, addressing custom compliance requirements, and applying maximum available protection to highly sensitive data are the primary driving factors behind these efforts. Government customers can use these products to exercise full operational control over their environment and even operate in a fully disconnected mode. As part of a cloud solution, they provide flexibility to support multiple data classifications under various conditions.
