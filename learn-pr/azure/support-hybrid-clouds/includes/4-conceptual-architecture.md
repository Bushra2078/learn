Azure offers an unmatched variety of public, private, and hybrid cloud deployment models to address each customerâ€™s concerns regarding the control of their data. Customers can augment Azure with on-premises and edge products such as Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge to support critical workloads over which customers seek increased or exclusive operational control.

Figure 4 shows a conceptual architecture using products and services that support various data classifications. Azure public multi-tenant cloud is the underlying cloud platform that makes this solution possible. Customers can augment Azure with on-premises and edge products such as Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge to accommodate critical workloads over which customers seek increased or exclusive operational control. For example, Azure Stack Hub is intended for on-premises deployment in a customer-owned datacenter where the customer has full control over service connectivity. Moreover, Azure Stack Hub can be deployed to address tactical edge deployments for limited or no connectivity, including fully mobile scenarios.
