You are now ready to start implementing the temperature service. In the previous unit, you determined that a serverless solution would best fit your needs. Let's start by creating a function app to hold our Azure Function.

## What is a function app?

Functions are hosted in an execution context called a **function app**. You define function apps to logically group and structure your functions and a compute resource in Azure. In our escalator example, you would create a function app to host the escalator drive gear temperature service. There are a few decisions that need to be made to create the function app; you need to choose a service plan and select a compatible storage account.

### Choose a service plan

Function apps may use one of two types of service plans:

- Consumption plan
- Azure App Service plan

When using the Azure serverless application platform, choose the **Consumption plan**. This plan provides automatic scaling and bills you only when your functions are running. The Consumption plan comes with a configurable timeout period for executing a function. By default, it's five (5) minutes, but may be configured to have a timeout as long as 10 minutes.

The **Azure App Service plan** enables you to avoid timeout periods by having your function run continuously on a VM that you define. When using an App Service plan, you are responsible for managing the app resources the function runs on, so this is technically not a serverless plan. However, it may be a better choice if your functions are used continuously, or if your functions require more processing power or longer execution time than the Consumption plan can provide.

### Storage account requirements

When you create a function app, it must be linked to a storage account. You can select an existing account or create a new one. The function app uses this storage account for internal operations, such as logging function executions and managing execution triggers. On the **Consumption plan**, this is also where the function code and configuration file are stored.

## Create a function app

Let's create a function app in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com" data-linktype="external" target="az-portal">Azure portal <span class="docon docon-navigate-external" aria-hidden="true"></span></a> using the same account you used to activate the sandbox.

1. Under **Azure services**, select **Create a resource**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-create-function-app-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure services with Create a resource highlighted." lightbox="../media/3-create-function-app-1.png":::

    The **Create a resource** pane appears.

1. In the menu, select **Compute**, and then select **Function App** in the *Popular products* list. The **Create Function App** pane appears.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project Details** |
    | Subscription | Concierge Subscription |
    | Resource Group | From the dropdown list, select **<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>** |
    | **Instance Details** |
    | Function App name  | Enter a globally unique app name, which becomes part of the base URL of your service. For example, you can name it **escalator-functions-xxx**, where you can replace xxx with your initials and a number. Valid characters are a-z, 0-9 and - |
    | Publish  | Code |
    | Runtime stack | Node.js (which is the language we use to implement the function examples in this exercise). |
    | Version | Accept *default* |
    | Region | Select a geographical location close to you. In a production system, you would want to select a location near your customers or consumers of the function. |

1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**. Deployment will take a few minutes. You'll receive a notification when deployment is completed.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you used to activate the sandbox.

1. Under **Azure services**, select **Create a resource**.

    The **Create a resource** pane appears.

1. In the resource menu, select **Compute**, and then in the results, select **Function App**. The **Create Function App** page appears.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project Details** |
    | Subscription | Concierge Subscription |
    | Resource Group | From the dropdown list, select **<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>** |
    | **Instance Details** |
    | Function App name  | Enter a globally unique app name. This value serves as the base URL of your service. For example, you can name it **escalator-functions-xxx**, replacing xxx with your initials and a number. Valid characters are a-z, 0-9 and - |
    | Publish  | Code |
    | Runtime stack | Node.js (the language we use to implement the function examples in this exercise). |
    | Version | Accept *default* |
    | Region | Select a geographical location close to you. In a production system, you would want to select a location near your customers or consumers of the function. |

1. Select **Review + create**, and upon validation, then select **Create**. Deployment will take a few minutes. The Deployment pane displays the resources that are being created, and will display a **Your deployment is complete** notification when deployment is completed.

## Verify your Azure function app

1. When deployment completes, select **Go to resource**. The Function App pane for your escalator function appears.

1. In the **Essentials** section, select the **URL** link to open it in a browser. A default Azure web page appears with a message that your Functions app is up and running.
