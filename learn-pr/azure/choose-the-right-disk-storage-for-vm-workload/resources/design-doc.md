## Title

Choose the right disk storage for your virtual machine workload

## Role(s)

- Solution Architect
- Administrator

## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Azure virtual machines
- Azure disk storage

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure disk storage
- Basic knowledge of Azure virtual machines and virtual machine types  

## Summary

*Add the summary [(Guidance)](id-guidance-introductory-summaries.md)*

## Learning objectives

1. Identify the types of disk storage available to virtual machines
1. Identify the capabilities of different disk storage
1. Identify the use cases for each type of disk storage

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Choose the right disk storage for your virtual machine workload*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    An organization is beginning a lift and shift migration to the cloud where many of their systems will be running on Azure virtual machines. These systems have a variety of usage and performance profiles, and they are unsure of the type disk storage available to them and which ones they should use for each workload. They need to balance performance, features, and cost to identify the right disk for each system.

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    1. Step
    1. Step

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

## Notes

If there's value to it, consider including an exercise to deploy a VM or two with a particular disk requirement. Definitely include some scenarios that the learner has to evaluate to determine the best type of disk storage. We don't need to demonstrate rote memorization, but they should be able to define the differences between the disk types and select the one that best fits the use case, based on size, price, performance, etc.

Doc on different disk types - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-types

Should include coverage of:

- Ultra SSD (preview, but worth covering)
- Premium SSD
- Standard SSD
- Standard HDD
- Temporary disk
- Ephemeral OS disks (preview, but worth covering)
- Managed and unmanaged disks
