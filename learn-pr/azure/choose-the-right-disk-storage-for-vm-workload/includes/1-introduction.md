Azure virtual machines use virtual disks to store data, just like physical servers use hard drives. When you create a virtual machine, you need to know which kinds of disk to create.

Suppose your healthcare organization is beginning a lift and shift migration to the cloud where many of their systems will be running on Azure virtual machines. These systems have a variety of usage and performance profiles, and they are unsure of the type of disk storage available to them and which ones they should use for each workload. They need to balance performance, features, and cost to identify the right disk for each system.

In this module, you will learn about unmanaged and managed disks, and disk types including ultra disks, solid state drives, and hard disk drives.

By the end of this module, you will be able to choose the optimal disk types for each virtual machine that you create in Azure, based on your peformance, cost, and functional requirements.
