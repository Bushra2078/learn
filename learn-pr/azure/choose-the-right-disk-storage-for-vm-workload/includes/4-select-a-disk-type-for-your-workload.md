## Notes from design doc
**Select a disk type for your workload**

*   Scenario 1

    *   Walk through a workload description that would require Ultra SSD
    *   Explain the decision to select Ultra SSD and why this was chosen
*   Scenario 2

    *   Walk through a workload description that would require Premium SSD
    *   Explain the decision to select Premium SSD and why this was chosen
*   Scenario 3

    *   Walk through a workload description that would require Standard SSD
    *   Explain the decision to select Premium SSD and why this was chosen
*   Scenario 4

    *   Walk through a workload description that would require Standard HDD
    *   Explain the decision to select Standard HDD and why this was chosen

Include some scenarios that the learner has to evaluate to determine the best type of disk storage. They should be able to define the differences between the disk types and select the one that best fits the use case, based on size, price, performance, etc.

Identify the use cases for each type of disk storage

*   Ultra SSD

    *   Critical workloads require enterprise-grade backup and recovery in the Azure cloud. Ideal if say the backup can be stored on Ultra SSD and reused to provision databases, so database Cloning using Ultra SSD
    *   When you need sub-millisecond latency and extremely scalable performance. For your most demanding, data-intensive workloads. Specifically designed for applications such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL,  benefit from low queue depths and for high IOPS workloads such as SQL Server, SAP/HANA, and Oracle DB.
*   Premium SSD

    *   for high-performance database workloads and other applications that require good storage performance
*   Standard SSD

    *   for cost-effective and consistent performance, also be used for backup and archiving applications
    *   Web servers, lightly used enterprise applications and dev/test
*   Standard HDD

    *   Backup, non-critical, infrequent access

**Knowledge check**

*   Question about the decision in scenario 1
*   Question about the decision in scenario 2
*   Question about the decision in scenario 3
*   Question about the decision in scenario 4
