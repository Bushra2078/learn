    choices:
    - content: "An ephemeral disk"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Ephemeral disks don't support 99.999% availability because data is stored in local virtual machine storage and not replicated."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Unmanaged disks don't guarantee 99.999% availability, although it may be possible to achieve this availability, if you choose a high-available storage account."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Managed disks guarantee 99.999% availability because data is automatically replicated."
