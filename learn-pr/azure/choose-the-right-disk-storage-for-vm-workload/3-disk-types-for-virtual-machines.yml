  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You need the best disk performance for a new virtual machine. What disk type should you use, assuming all disk types are supported in your region?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ultra SSD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Ultra SSDs offer the best performance of disk types on Azure."
    - content: "Premium SSD"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Premium SSDs have excellent performance, but do not offer the best performance of disk types on Azure."
    - content: "Standard HDD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Standard HDDs don't perform as well as premium SSDs or Ultra SSDs."
  - content: "You have a medium-sized application with modest IO requirements. However, you need to ensure that a throughput of 25 MBps is guaranteed. What disk type should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Premium SSD"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Standard tier disks don't guarantee a minimum throughput. For such a guarantee, use premium SSD disks."
    - content: "Standard SSD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although standard SSDs can easily support the required throughput 99% of the time, that performance is not guaranteed."
    - content: "Standard HDD"
