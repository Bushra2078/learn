Suppose you work for a clothing brand as the collaborative tools expert for the Global Expansion team. The team collaborates virtually through a multi-user mixed reality application to plan new store openings, thus enabling the ability to work from virtually anywhere in the world. The team spans across seven countries and includes individuals who all speak various languages. As the team prepares to map out product placement and store displays, they find that the language barrier sometimes result in miscommunication amongst the team. To foster an inclusive work environment, your team is need of a speech translation service that can integrate into the collaboration tool.

In this module, you will create a Mixed Reality speech translation application that translates speech to a chosen language. A microphone will be used to capture speech that is sent to the Azure Cognitive Services Speech Translation service. The service will return a string of translated text which will display in the application's interface.

By the end of this module, you will be able to integrate Speech Translation as a feature into a Mixed Reality application.
