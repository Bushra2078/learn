In the previous exercise, you created an initial Bicep file that contains the toy truck virtual machine and the associated resources. However, the Bicep template doesn't follow best practices, and it's a little hard to read. In this unit, you'll refactor the file.

During the process, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Update the symbolic names for your resources and parameters.
> - Remove redundant parameters, resources, and properties.
> - Add variables and parameters to make your Bicep file reusable.

## Update the resource symbolic names

1. Open the *main.bicep* file in Visual Studio Code.

1. Select the symbolic name for the network security group resource, which is named `networkSecurityGroups_ToyTruckServer_nsg_name_resource` or a similar name.

   Rename the symbolic name. You can choose to select <kbd>F2</kbd>, or select and hold (or right-click) and select **Rename Symbol**.

   Enter the name `networkSecurityGroup` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Visual Studio Code updates the name and all of the references inside the file.

1. Repeat this process for each resource, and rename them as listed below:

   > [!NOTE]
   > The names of the resources in your deployment will be a little different to the ones below. Find the resources that have names that are close to the names listed here.

   | Resource type | Current symbolic name | New symbolic name |
   |-|-|-|
   | Public IP address | `publicIPAddresses_ToyTruckServer_ip_name_resource` | `publicIPAddress` |
   | Virtual network | `virtualNetworks_learn_b44b5d84_e9a2_4b1b_8d33_fdf6122b54ad_vnet_name_resource` | `virtualNetwork ` |
   | Virtual machine | `virtualMachines_ToyTruckServer_name_resource` | `virtualMachine` |
   | Subnet | `virtualNetworks_learn_b44b5d84_e9a2_4b1b_8d33_fdf6122b54ad_vnet_name_default` | `defaultSubnet` |
   | Network interface | `networkInterfaces_toytruckserver686_name_resource` | `networkInterface` |

## Fix the redundant parameter

Notice there is a parameter named similarly to `networkSecurityGroups_NSG_westus_externalid`. Its default value is the resource ID of the network security group. This is an example of an error in the export process: the network security group is defined within the template, so it shouldn't be specified by using a parameter. Here, you will update the template to dynamically obtain its resource ID from the network security group resource.

1. Delete the parameter named `networkSecurityGroups_NSG_westus_externalid`.

1. In the `virtualNetwork` resource, notice that the Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code detects the missing parameter as a problem and indicates this with a red squiggly line.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-virtual-network-nsg-problem.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing the virtualNetwork resource definition, with the error highlighted." border="true":::

1. Update the virtual network's `networkSecurityGroup.id` property to `networkSecurityGroup.id`:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-virtual-network-nsg-fixed-1.bicep" highlight="16" :::

## Remove the redundant subnet resource

The virtual network's subnet is currently defined twice: once in the `virtualNetwork` resource, and again as its own child resource named `defaultSubnet`. It doesn't make sense to define it twice.

1. Delete the `defaultSubnet` resource.

   Notice that the `networkInterface` resource now displays an problem, since it refers to the default subnet's resource ID:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-network-interface-subnet-problem.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing the networkInterface resource definition, with the error highlighted." border="true":::

1. Update the `virtualNetwork` resource to include an `existing` reference to the subnet, which enables you to refer to the subnet within your Bicep code without defining it again:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-virtual-network-nsg-fixed-2.bicep" highlight="28-30" :::

1. Update the `networkInterface` resource to refer to the subnet's resource ID:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-network-interface-fixed.bicep" highlight="15" :::

## Change the parameters to variables

The parameters in the current template don't really need to be parameters. Here, you'll convert them to variables. At the same time, you'll rename them to more meaningful names.

1. Select the symbolic name for the `virtualNetworks_ToyTruck_vnet_name` parameter. Rename it to `virtualNetworkName`.

1. Change the parameter to a variable. Remember to remove the type, since variable definitions don't include types:

   ```bicep
   var virtualNetworkName = 'ToyTruck-vnet'
   ```

1. Repeat the process for each parameter, and rename them as listed below:

   | Current parameter name | New variable name |
   |-|-|
   | `virtualMachines_ToyTruckServer_name` | `virtualMachineName` |
   | `networkInterfaces_toytruckserver890_name` | `networkInterfaceName` |
   | `publicIPAddresses_ToyTruckServer_ip_name` | `publicIPAddressName` |
   | `networkSecurityGroups_ToyTruckServer_nsg_name` | `networkSecurityGroupName` |

1. Verify that your variable declarations look similar to the following:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-variables.bicep" :::

## Update the resource locations

All of the resources currently use a hard-coded location. Here, you'll add a parameter so that the template becomes more reusable.

1. At the top of the file, add a new parameter and a description decorator to make its purpose clear:

   ```bicep
   @description('The location into which the resources should be deployed.')
   param location string = resourceGroup().location
   ```

1. Update each resource to use the `location` parameter instead of the hard-coded `westus` location.

## Add parameters and variables

Your template has some hard-coded values where parameters or variables would be more appropriate. Here, you'll add parameters for properties that might change between deployments, and variables for values that won't.

1. At the top of the *main.bicep* file, below the `location` parameter, add the following parameters:

   ```bicep
   @description('The name of the size of the virtual machine to deploy.')
   param virtualMachineSizeName string = 'Standard_D2s_v3'
   
   @description('The name of the storage account SKU to use for the virtual machine\'s managed disk.')
   param virtualMachineManagedDiskStorageAccountType string = 'Premium_LRS'
   
   @description('The administrator username for the virtual machine.')
   param virtualMachineAdminUsername string = 'toytruckadmin'
   
   @description('The administrator password for the virtual machine.')
   @secure()
   param virtualMachineAdminPassword string
   
   @description('The name of the SKU of the public IP address to deploy.')
   param publicIPAddressSkuName string = 'Basic'
   
   @description('The virtual network address range.')
   param virtualNetworkAddressPrefix string = '10.0.0.0/16'
   
   @description('The default subnet address range within the virtual network')
   param virtualNetworkDefaultSubnetAddressPrefix string = '10.0.0.0/24'
   ```

1. Add the following new variable declarations:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-main-refactored.bicep" range="26-37" highlight="2, 3-8" :::

1. Update the `publicIPAddress` resource to refer to the `publicIPAddressSkuName` parameter in its `sku.name` property.

1. Update the `virtualNetwork` resource to refer to the parameters and variables:

   - Use the `virtualNetworkAddressPrefix` parameter within the virtual network's `addressSpace.addressPrefixes` property.
   - Use the `virtualNetworkDefaultSubnetName` variable for the subnet `name` properties. Make sure to change both the `subnets` property and the nested `existing` resource.
   - Use the `vnetDefaultSubnetAddressPrefix` parameter for the subnet's `addressPrefix` property.

1. Update the `virtualMachine` resource to refer to the parameters and variables: 

   - Use the `virtualMachineSizeName` parameter for the `hardwareProfile.vmSize` property.
   - Use the `virtualMachineImageReference` variable for the `storageProfile.imageReference` property.
   - Use the `virtualMachineManagedDiskStorageAccountType` parameter for the `storageProfile.osDisk.managedDisk.storageAccountType` property.
   - Use the `virtualMachineAdminUsername` parameter for the `osProfile.adminUsername` property.
   - Directly below the `osProfile.adminUsername` property, add a new property named `adminPassword`. Set its value to the `virtualMachineAdminPassword` parameter.

## Remove unnecessary properties

The export process adds redundant properties to many resources. Here, you remove the extraneous properties.

1. In the `networkSecurityGroup` resource, remove the `securityRules` property, since it's empty. Remove the `properties` property since it's empty now, too.

1. In the `publicIPAddress` resource:

   - Remove the `ipAddress` property, since it's automatically set by Azure.
   - Remove the `ipTags` property, since it's empty.

1. In the `virtualNetwork` resource, remove the `delegations` and `virtualNetworkPeerings` properties, since they're empty.

1. In the `virtualMachine` resource:

   - Remove the `storageProfile.osDisk.managedDisk.id` property, since Azure automatically determines this when the virtual machine is deployed.
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > It's important to remove this property, otherwise your template won't deploy correctly.
   - Remove the `requireGuestProvisionSignal` property, since Azure sets this automatically.
   - Remove the `storageProfile.dataDisks` and `osProfile.secrets` properties, since they're empty.

1. In the `networkInterface` resource:

   - Remove the `privateIPAddress` property from `ipConfigurations`, since it's automatically set by Azure because the allocation method is _Dynamic_.
   - Remove the `dnsServers` property from `dnsSettings`, since it's empty. Remove the `dnsSettings` property since it's empty now, too.

> [!TIP]
> When you work with your own templates, you'll need to determine whether there are any properties that should be removed like you've done here.
> 
> In Visual Studio Code, the Bicep extension helps you to set the minimum properties for a resource. After you select the <kbd>=</kbd> key in the resource definition, Visual Studio Code prompts you to select **required-properties**:
> 
> :::image type="content" source="../media/5-visual-studio-code-required-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing the required properties selection when defining a new Bicep resource." border="true":::
>
> When you select **required-properties**, Visual Studio Code pre-populates the resource definition with the properties that are mandatory. You can refer to this to determine whether the properties in your converted template all need to be present.
> 
> The Azure Quickstart Templates repository is also helpful for this task. Find a quickstart template that is approximately what you're trying to do, and look at the properties it sets on the resource.

## Create a parameter file

Your parameters are currently defined as default values in your template. To make your template work well across environments, it's a good idea to create a parameter file, and to remove default values for parameters that need to change for each environment.

1. Create a new file named *main.parameters.production.json*.

1. Paste the following JSON into the *main.parameters.production.json* file:

   :::code language="json" source="code/5-parameters.json" :::

1. Update your *main.bicep* to remove the default values for the parameters you specified in the parameters file. Notice that you leave the default values for the `location` and `publicIPAddressSkuName` parameters, since they are likely to be the same for all of your environments.

## Verify your template

1. At the end of the _refactor_ phase, your *main.bicep* file should look similar to the following:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-main-refactored.bicep" :::

1. Select **View** > **Problems** to show the problems pane.

   No problems are indicated.

> [!TIP]
> When you work with your own templates, you might make different choices about the properties to parameterize and other customizations. Throughout this module, we provide general guidance to help you get started, but you'll need to consider your own environment and how you want to reuse your templates when deciding how to refactor your own Bicep files.
