You're preparing to convert a series of ARM JSON templates and deployed Azure resources to Bicep. Your company has standardized on Bicep for infrastructure as code, and you want to have a consistent code base for your Azure resources.

In this module, you learned how to decompile JSON templates to Bicep. Templates that are converted to Bicep have limitations, and they should be used as reference points for your final templates. Following a recommended workflow and using available tools will help create consistency across your code base.

You also learned how to export existing Azure resources to Bicep and how to work with around the limitations from these exports. You used the same workflow and tools for exported templates.

Finally, you learned how to use the what-if operation and documentation resources to verify your converted templates. The ARM template reference documentation and Azure quickstart templates are an excellent resource to validate your templates before deployment.
