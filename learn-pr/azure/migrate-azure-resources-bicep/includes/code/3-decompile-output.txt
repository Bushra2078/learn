WARNING: Decompilation is a best-effort process, as there is no guaranteed mapping from ARM JSON
 to Bicep.

You might need to fix warnings and errors in the generated bicep file(s), or decompilation might fail
 entirely if an accurate conversion is not possible.

If you would like to report any issues or inaccurate conversions,
please see https://github.com/Azure/bicep/issues.
