  questions:
    - content: "What's the purpose of the 'ClusterIP' service type?"
      choices:
        - content: "To freeze the cluster's IP. So we can access it directly."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The cluster's IP is already a fixed IP present in the AKS dashboard."
        - content: "To make services available to other AKS clusters within Azure network."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Services don't work across clusters. Their work is focused on their current cluster."
        - content: "To group pods into one single IP that's only available within the cluster."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, services of that type expose the selected pods internally."

    - content: "What's the purpose of the 'LoadBalancer' service type?"
      choices:
        - content: "Exposes the service externally using Azure's load-balancing solution."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, services of that type expose the selected pods externally using an Azure Load-Balancing solution."
        - content: "To balance the flow of internal communication in the cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Services don't interfere with cluster traffic."
        - content: "To group several different pods into a reverse proxy that's used internally in the cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "It's not possible to group different pods and differentiate them using their IPs as a reverse proxy. That's how an ingress controller works."

    - content: "What is an Ingress?"
      choices:
        - content: "A workload to create DNS zone records in Azure via API access to the cloud."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Despite triggering the event that causes the creation of new DNS Zones, an Ingress isn't meant for that."
        - content: "A workload to define the set of rules that allow external applications into the cluster."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, ingress defines a set of rules to allow external application into the cluster."
        - content: "Groups pods into one single IP address so they don't lose their IPs when destroyed."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "That's not the job the ingress, this is the purpose of the service."
