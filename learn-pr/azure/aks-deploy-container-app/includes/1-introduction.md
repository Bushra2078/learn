Imagine you work for a growing video editing company that, because of the increased demand because of international expansion, needs to scale the product so it can provide a better experience to all customers. They've asked you to assess which Azure service would improve their ability to scale to meet demand.

You've identified Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as a potential solution, as it meets the requirements to enable your application to handle the company's increased growth. You need to better understand how to deploy applications to AKS, and how to expose your applications to users.
