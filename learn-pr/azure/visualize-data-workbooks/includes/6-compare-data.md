You can merge or join data to provide rich insights using the merge control. 

Merging data from different sources can enhance the insights experience. An example is augmenting active alert information with related metric data. Merging data allows users to see not just the effect (an active alert) but also potential causes, for example, high CPU usage. The monitoring domain has numerous such correlatable data sources that are often critical to the triage and diagnostic workflow.

- **Merge**. Merge or join data to provide rich insights. There are several correlatable data sources that can be important to the triage and diagnostic workflow.For example, you can augment active alert information with related metric data. Merging data lets you see the active alert and also see potential causes, for example, high CPU usage. 
Workbooks support these merges:
* Inner unique join
* Full inner join
* Full outer join
* Left outer join
* Right outer join
* Left semi-join
* Right semi-join
* Left anti-join
* Right anti-join
* Union
* Duplicate table


With workbooks, you can query different data sources. Workbooks also provide simple controls that you can use to merge or join data to provide rich insights. The *merge* control is the way to achieve it.
