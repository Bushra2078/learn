Azure Workbooks help you combine data from multiple data sources to build interactive visual reports for data analysis and reporting.

# Example scenario

Suppose you’re the IT admin for a large retail company. You manage multiple application and service teams. Each team needs a way to evaluate the performance and utilization of the Azure resources in their subscription. You want to build a visual report in the Azure portal that is interactive, can be used by all your teams to easily understand the type of resources, their geo-distribution, and key metrics for each resource. By the end of this module, you'll be able to create a new visual report using Azure Workbooks. The report will display the distribution of resources across the team’s subscriptions and you'll be able to visually assess the usage of individual resources.
## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll generate a report with several visualizations to help you analyze data from multiple data sources. You'll create a new workbook, query your resources to see how they're distributed globally, and then create charts and graphs to compare data from the different resources.
## What is the main goal?
By the end of this session, you'll be able to generate a report with visualizations that compare data from more than one data source.
