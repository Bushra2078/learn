As an IT admin, you need a way to build a report that can be used interactively by all your teams, no matter what resources they use.

Azure Workbooks is a platform for building interactive reports that can query different data sources to monitor multiple components of your application. You can use the several types of visualizations supported by Azure Workbooks to compare the data from multiple data sources all in one report.

In this module, we were able to build interactive visualizations by querying information from multiple sources to display the distribution of resources across the teamâ€™s subscriptions and to assess the usage of individual resources.

<!-- 3. Describe the experience without the product ---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe what would be required to solve the problem without using the product; be brief (1-2 sentences)

    Heading: none; typically this will be a new paragraph

    Example: "Fire extinguishers are critical safety equipment for both homes and businesses. Despite their importance, many customers don't read the instructions ahead of time. Confusing instructions could mean customers don't use the extinguisher correctly when they're needed. This can result in loss of property or life."

TODO: describe the experience without the product

<!-- 4. Describe the business impact ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: explain the business impact of using the product to solve the problem

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "The test for effective instructions is whether customers can use your extinguishers correctly during an emergency. Users that fail might blame the instructions or the product. In either case, it's not good for business. On the other hand, successful customers are likely to share their stories and become advocates for your product."

<!-- 5. References (optional) ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide a few recommendations for further study via a bulleted list of links. This is optional and intended to be used sparingly.        - use the target page title as the text for your link
        - do not include other text such as a description
        - prefer other first-party sites like Docs reference pages
        - link to third-party sites only when they are trusted and authoritative
        - do not link to other Learn content ("next steps" recommendations are generated automatically)
        - avoid linking to opinion sites such as blog posts

    Heading: "## References"

    Example:
        "## References
          * [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles)
          * [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)
          * [Manage access to billing information for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-manage-access)"
