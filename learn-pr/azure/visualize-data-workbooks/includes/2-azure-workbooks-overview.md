Azure Workbooks combine text,â€¯log queries, metrics, and parameters in single tool. Workbooks use multiple kinds of visualizations and analyses to create rich interactive reports. Workbooks are the foundation for many of the Azure monitor insights. You can use Workbook's flexible canvas for free-form data exploration to extract data from multiple data sources and combine them into an individualized report. You can share Workbooks with your team in the Azure portal, to interactively gather and share information.

## Data Sources
You can query and combine data from multiple data sources within a single report. Workbooks support these data sources:

- Azure Monitor logs
- Activity logs
- Metrics
- Azure Resource Graph
- Azure Resource Manager REST operations
- Azure Data Explorer
- Azure resource health
- JSON
- Merged data
- Data imported from custom endpoints
- Workload health

## Visualizations
Using workbooks, you can use a rich set of visualizations to customize the reports based on your needs and requirements. You can create a workbook that uses a combination of any of these visualizations:

- Text parameters
- Charts
- Grids
- Tiles
- Trees
- Honeycombs
- Graphs
- Maps
- Text visualizations

This is an example of a report that combines data from multiple sources to produce some visualizations to help you analyze the data.
