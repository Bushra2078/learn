Workbooks are the foundation for many of the Azure monitor insights. You can use Workbook's flexible canvas for free-form data exploration to extract data from multiple data sources and combine them into an individualized report. Azure Workbooks combine text,â€¯log queries, metrics, and parameters, and include multiple kinds of visualizations and analyses to create rich interactive reports with a single tool. You can share Workbooks with your team in the Azure portal, to interactively gather and share information.

Workbooks are helpful to analyze things like:

- Virtual machine usage. You can discover metrics for CPU utilization, disk space, memory, and network dependencies.
- Performance of a recently provisioned VM. You can display metrics for key counters and other log events to other team members.
- Results of a resizing experiment of your VM. You can show each usage metric and the analytics queries used to evaluate the experiment, and clearly call-out if a metric isn't within the target range.
- The effect of an outage on the usage of a resource.

## Data Sources
Workbooks can query data from multiple Azure sources. You can combine data from multiple data sources within a single report, and transform the data to give you visual insights into the availability, performance, usage, and overall health of your resources. 

## Visualizations
Using workbooks, you can use a rich set of visualizations to customize the reports based on your needs and requirements. You can create a workbook that uses a combination of any of these visualizations:

- Text parameters
- Charts
- Grids
- Tiles
- Trees
- Honeycombs
- Graphs
- Maps
- Text visualizations

This screenshot shows an example of a report that combines data from multiple sources to produce visualizations that help analyze the data.
