Workbooks are the foundation for many of the Azure monitor insights. You can use Workbook's flexible canvas for free-form data exploration to extract data from multiple data sources and combine them into an individualized report. Azure Workbooks combine text,â€¯log queries, metrics, and parameters, and include multiple kinds of visualizations and analyses to create rich interactive reports with a single tool. You can share Workbooks with your team in the Azure portal, to interactively gather and share information.

## Data Sources
You can query and combine data from multiple data sources within a single report. Workbooks support these data sources:

- Azure Monitor logs
- Activity logs
- Metrics
- Azure Resource Graph
- Azure Resource Manager REST operations
- Azure Data Explorer
- Azure resource health
- JSON
- Merged data
- Data imported from custom endpoints
- Workload health
- Azure RBAC data
- Change Analysis (preview)

## Visualizations
Using workbooks, you can use a rich set of visualizations to customize the reports based on your needs and requirements. You can create a workbook that uses a combination of any of these visualizations:

- Text parameters
- Charts
- Grids
- Tiles
- Trees
- Honeycombs
- Graphs
- Maps
- Text visualizations

This is an example of a report that combines data from multiple sources to produce some visualizations to help you analyze the data.
