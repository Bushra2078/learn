You need a way to build customized reports to get the data you need to effectively monitor your systems. You need to be able to set up the reports in a way that make it visually easy to analyze the data. And you need the reports to be able to be shared and interactively used by all your teams.

Azure Workbooks is a platform for building interactive reports that can query different data sources to monitor multiple components of your application. You can use the several types of visualizations supported by Azure Workbooks to compare the data from multiple data sources all in one report.

In this module, we were able to build interactive visualizations by querying information from multiple sources to display the distribution of resources across the teamâ€™s subscriptions and to assess the usage of individual resources.
