 In this exercise, we are going to create a query that uses data from Azure resource health. Azure resource health helps detect service problems that affect your Azure resources. We are going to create a report with:

 - a chart that provides a quick visual overview of the health of the infrastructure running our application
 - a color-coded honeycomb graph to show the CPU usage of your virtual machines

## Add a visualization to show the availability of your resources
