In addition to creating visualizations to display data from your resources, Workbooks provides functionality to combine and correlate the data from these sources to give you greater insight into your system.

You can use techniques like using graphs or charts side by side to give you a quick visual idea of how the resources compare. You can use rendering and style settings to implement visuals like "traffic lights" or color coding to make issues easily identifiable. All of these tools allow you to completely customize your reports for effective and efficient system monitoring.

You can also merge data from different sources can enhance the insights experience. Azure Monitor has several correlatable data sources that are often critical to the triage and diagnostic workflow. You can merge or join data to provide rich insights using the merge control.

For example, you can augment active alert information with related metric data. Merging data allows you to see the effect of an active alert, and also gives you insight into potential causes, such as high CPU usage.

Workbooks support these merges:

* Inner unique join
* Full inner join
* Full outer join
* Left outer join
* Right outer join
* Left semi-join
* Right semi-join
* Left anti-join
* Right anti-join
* Union
* Duplicate table
