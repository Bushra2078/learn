## Getting started guides

The Cloud Adoption Framework spans the entire cloud adoption lifecycle. Throughout that lifecycle, you may use a variety of methodologies that are designed to help a specific role deliver a defined function. When you're dealing with an adoption blocker, there isn't time to mature along all of those potential roles and methodologies. The Cloud Adoption Framework getting started guides pull out the actionable tasks and deliverables from each relevant methodology to help a smaller team deliver results faster.

These guides also categorize blockers into the following areas on the [getting started page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/?azure-portal=true):

- **Establish teams:** Depending on your adoption strategy and operating model, you might need to establish a few teams. This section helps you get those new teams started or redistribute duties if a dedicated team isn't needed.
- **Improve controls:** As adoption of the cloud grows, you need a solid operating model to ensure wise decisions and proper organizational change. Align people and improve operations to develop your cloud operating model.
- **Accelerate adoption:** Cloud adoption requires technical change, but it requires more than just IT to digitally transform with the cloud. Use these guides to start aligning various teams to accelerate migration and innovation efforts.
- **Align foundation:** Your company's cloud is built on a set of foundational decisions that can impact all cloud-based outcomes. This guide and conceptual information can help you make core decisions and document them.
