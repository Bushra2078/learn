The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) for Azure Learn modules will teach you how to apply the various guidance, tools, best practices, and reference architectures found within each of the methodologies. This module serves as an accelerator, helping you accelerate and unblock adoption in parallel to your learning paths.

In this module, you will review the narrative that spans the majority of the Learn modules in this learning path. You will also see how various getting started guides can accelerate results across your adoption efforts.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand common roadblocks that prevent adoption success.
- Evaluate one or more guides that can help you get things moving (or moving faster).
- Get started on the proper course of action using shared guidance and related Learn modules.

## Prerequisites

Before applying the CAF Learn modules, you should have a general understanding of your current cloud adoption plan and an understanding of the roadblocks that may be presenting your organization from being successful.

As an alternative, a narrative and cloud adoption plan will be provided for a reference customer called "Tailwind Traders".
