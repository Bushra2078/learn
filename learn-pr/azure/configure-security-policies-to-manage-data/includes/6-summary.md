Data classification and analysis helps you know what data you need to protect and assess the risks involved in using, storing, and transmitting that data. Every organization has unique data that has specific security requirements. Unless specific work is done to identify the risks involved in a security breach, the costs and tools needed to protect that data can't be fully understood.

In this module we turned on **Advanced Data Security** on an Azure SQL database. This has a monthly cost above and beyond the DB storage itself. If you did this work in your own subscription, make sure to turn this feature off to avoid unexpected costs.
