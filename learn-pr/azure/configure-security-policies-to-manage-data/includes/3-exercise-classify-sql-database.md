In this step, you will create your resource group and an Azure SQL Database single database containing the AdventureWorksLT sample data

1. Sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you used to activate the Azure Sandbox. Make sure you are in the Microsoft Learn Sandbox directory.
1. Select **+ Create a resource** in the left sidebar of the Azure portal.
1. Select **Databases** and then select **SQL Database** to open the **Create SQL Database** page.

    ![Screenshot of the SQL Database create page](../media/M04-L01-01-create-database-1.png)

1. Use these values to fill out the form.

    | Setting      | Value |
    | ------------ | ----- |
    | **Database name** | **LearnDataPolicy** |
    | **Subscription** | Concierge Subscription |
    | **Resource group** |  Use the existing group <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> |
    | **Want to use SQL elastic pool?** | **No** |

1. Under **Server**, click **Create new**, fill out the form, then click **OK**. Here's more information on how to fill out the form:

    | Setting      | Value |
    | ------------ | ----- |
    | **Server name** | A globally unique [server name](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions). |
    | **Server admin login** | A [database identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers) that serves as your primary administrator login name. |
    | **Password** | Any valid password that has at least eight characters and contains characters from three of these categories: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters. |
    | **Location** | Any valid location from the available list below. |

    [!include[](../../../includes/azure-sandbox-regions-first-mention-note-friendly.md)]

1. Select the **Additional settings** tab.
1. In the **Data source** section, under **Use existing data**, select **Sample**.


    :::image type="content" source="../media/M04-L01-01-create-sql-database-additional-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of additional configuration page.":::

1. Under **Enable Advanced Data Security**, verify **Start free trial** is selected.
1. Leave the rest of the values as default and select **Review + Create** at the bottom of the form.
1. Review the final settings and select **Create**.

It will take a few minutes to deploy the server with sample data. Once it's complete, select **Go to resource** to navigate to the Overview view of your new SQL database.

## SQL Information Protection (SQL IP)

SQL IP brings a set of advanced services and SQL capabilities, forming a new information protection paradigm in SQL aimed
at protecting the data, not just the database:

* **Azure SQL Auditing** – Azure SQL Auditing tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure storage account, Log Analytics workspace or Event Hub.
* **Data Discovery & Classifications** – Is built into Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics. It provides advanced capabilities for discovering, classifying, labeling, and reporting the sensitive data in your databases.
* **Dynamic data masking** – Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics support dynamic data masking. Dynamic data masking limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users.
* **Security Center** – Scans your database and makes recommendations to improve security. Also alowes you to set up and and monitor **Security Alerts**.
* **Transparent data encryption** – Transparent data encryption encrypts your databases, backups, and logs at rest without any changes to your application. To enable encryption, go to each database.

### Classify your SQL DB

Let's classify the data in this sample Azure SQL database.

1. Under the **Security** heading in the Azure SQL Database pane, navigate to **Security Center**.
1. If Advanced Data Security isn't enabled, select the **Settings** at the top, and then **Enable** button to enable it. As noted in the instructions above, you can turn this on as part of the DB creation. This will take a minute to activate.

1. Select the **Security Center** on the left.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/M4_01_02_01.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Advanced Threat Protection pane, with the Data Discovery and Classification preview card called out.":::

1. Select **Data Discovery & Classification** initial state will have recommended - 15 in this case. Select Security check to review the recommendations.  If you have not yet run the check do so now.

    ‎![Screenshot of the Data discovery and classification (preview) pane, Overview tab with the previously mentioned items displaying.](../media/M4_01_02_02.png)

1. Select all the columns and then **Accept selected recommendations**.

1. Select **Save** to save the recommendations, and then switch back to the **Data Discovery & Classification**.

1. Review the **Data Discovery & Classification**. Notice that it includes a summary of the current classification state of the database, including a detailed list of all classified columns. You can also filter this view to only see specific schema parts, information types, and labels.

    ‎![Screenshot of the Data discovery and classification (preview) pane, Overview tab with the previously mentioned items displaying.](../media/M4_01_02_021.png)

1. To download a report in Excel format, in the top menu of the window select Export.

    ![Screenshot of the Data discovery and classification (preview) pane with Export selected.](../media/M4_01_02_03.png)

### Customizing the classification

The **Classification** tab lists the columns and how the data is classified.

   ![Screenshot of the Classification tab.](../media/M4_01_02_04.png)

As you saw earlier, the classification engine scans your database for columns containing potentially sensitive data and provides a list of recommended column classifications.

You can either take the suggested classifications as we did earlier, or manually classify columns as an alternative to or in addition to the recommendation-based classification.

1. In the top menu of the window, select **Add classification**.

    ![Screenshot of the Data discovery and classification (preview) pane with Add classification selected.](../media/M4_01_02_06.png)

1. In the Add classification pane, configure the five fields that display, and then select **+ Add classification**:
   * Schema name
   * Table name
   * Column name
   * Information type
   * Sensitivity label.

    ![In the Add classification pane, the previously mentioned fields are called out.](../media/M4_01_02_07.png)

1. To complete your classification and persistently label (tag) the database columns with the new classification metadata, in the top menu of the window, select **+ Add classification** at the bottom of the form and **Save** on the **Data Discovery & Classification** overview page.

1. You should now see **Overview  & Classification** tabs at the top.

1. Select the Classification Tab, and changing some of the classifications for identified columns - for example, setting the PasswordHash to **Highly Confidential** in the **Sensitivity** label columns.

1. You can also filter the data being viewed through the filter boxes right below the graphs on the **Overview** tab.

## Monitor access to sensitive data

An important aspect of the IP paradigm is the ability to monitor access to sensitive data. [Azure SQL Database Auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing) has been enhanced to include a new field in the audit log. The data_sensitivity_information field logs the sensitivity classifications (labels) of the actual data that was returned by the query.

![Screenshot of field logs, with data sensitivity categorizations of Confidential, and Confidential GDPR called out.](../media/M4_01_02_08.png)

Consider configuring Azure SQL Database Auditing for monitoring and auditing access to your classified sensitive data.
