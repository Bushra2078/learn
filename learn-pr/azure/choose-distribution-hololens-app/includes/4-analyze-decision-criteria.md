When deciding on a distribution strategy for your HoloLens 2 application, it's essential to ask yourself a series of questions to ensure you make an informed decision. Here are 10 key questions that developers should consider:
- Who is my target audience? Understanding your target audience's preferences, behavior, and accessibility is crucial in selecting the most effective distribution strategy.
- What are my app's goals and objectives? Clarify the purpose of your application and identify the desired outcomes to align your distribution strategy accordingly.
- What is the scope of my app? Determine if your app caters to a niche market, a specific industry, or if it has broader appeal, as this decision influences the choice of distribution channels.
- What level of control do I need over app distribution? Assess whether you require full control over app deployment, updates, and monetization, or if you're open to using existing platforms and marketplaces.
- How important is app discoverability? Consider the visibility and discoverability your app have on different distribution platforms, and evaluate how it aligns with your marketing and promotional efforts.
- What are the monetization options available? Explore the monetization models offered by different distribution channels to determine which aligns best with your app's revenue strategy. Examples include paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, or ad revenue.
- What are the technical requirements and limitations of each distribution option? Understand the technical considerations, such as file formats, compatibility, and restrictions imposed by different distribution methods to ensure your app meets the necessary criteria.
- Do I require enterprise deployment capabilities? Determine if your app needs to be distributed within closed enterprise environments, necessitating support for enterprise app stores or deployment tools.
- What is the level of support and resources available for each distribution option? Consider the level of support, documentation, and community resources provided by the distribution channels, as this information can impact the ease of implementation and troubleshooting.
- What are the long-term implications of my distribution strategy? Consider the scalability, maintenance, and updates required for your chosen distribution method, and evaluate if it aligns with your long-term app development and management goals.

By reflecting on these questions, you can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions regarding your applicationâ€™s distribution strategy.
