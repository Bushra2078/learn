With deadlines approaching, you need to render video scenes in a few hours so that reviews can complete within the same day.

Azure HPC Cache let you remove the bottleneck from storage and allowed your HPC clients to access the data faster. when you connected the cache to the NAS and pointed your HPC clients to the cache, the cloud clients ran more efficiently and created more video content in less time.

Without HPC Cache, video edits and reviews would need to wait until the next business day. This limitation would reduce the team's efficiency and cause the video release to be delayed. The delay in time might also lead to lost revenue, upset stakeholders, and a poor customer experience.

With HPC Cache, this workload and future HPC workloads can finish faster. Deadlines are met, which wouldn't have been possible if you relied solely on existing compute and storage resources. Your storage solution ran more efficiently, and reviewers could make more changes in less time. Greater efficiency improved the time to market and also improved your workflow for future projects.
