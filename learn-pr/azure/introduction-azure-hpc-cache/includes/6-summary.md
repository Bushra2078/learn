With deadlines approaching, we needed to render video scenes with a few hours so that reviews can complete within the same day.

HPC Cache let us remove the bottleneck from storage and allowed our HPC clients to access the data faster. After connecting the cache to the NAS and pointing our HPC clients to the cache, the cloud clients ran more efficiently and created more video content in less time.

Without HPC Cache, video edits and reviews would need to wait until the next business day. This limitation would reduce the team's efficiency and cause the video release to be delayed. The delay in time could also lead to lost revenue, upset stakeholders, and a poor customer experience.

With HPC Cache, this workload and future HPC workloads will finish faster. Deadlines will be met, which wouldn't have been possible if relying solely on existing compute and storage resources. Our storage solution was able to run more efficiently, and reviewers were able to make more changes in less time. Greater efficiency improved the time to market and also improved our workflow for future projects.
