With deadlines approaching, we needed to render video scenes with a few hours so reviews can complete within the same day. 

Azure HPC Cache let us remove the bottleneck from storage and allowed our HPC clients to access the data faster. After connecting the cache to the NAS and pointing our HPC clients to the cache, the cloud clients ran more efficiently and created more video content in less time. 

Without Azure HPC Cache, video edits and reviews would need to wait until the next business day. This would reduce the team's efficiency and cause the video release to be delayed. The delay in time could also lead to lost revenue and upset stakeholders.
leading to lost revenue and a poor customer experience.

With Azure HPC Cache, this workload and future HPC workloads will finish faster. Deadlines will be met which wouldn't have been possible if relying solely on existing compute and storage resources. Our storage solution was able to run more efficiently and reviewers were able to make more changes in less time. This not only improved the time to market but it also improved our workflow for future projects.
