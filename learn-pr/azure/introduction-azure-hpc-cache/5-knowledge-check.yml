quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which file sharing protocol is ideal for Azure HPC Cache to accelerate?"
    choices:
    - content: "NFS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure HPC Cache was designed to accelerate NFS workloads."
    - content: "NTFS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "NTFS is not a supported protocol for Azure HPC Cache."
    - content: "SFTP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SFTP is not a supported protocol for Azure HPC Cache."
  - content: "Ideal workloads for Azure HPC Cache are heavy in which operation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Directory operations (listing folder content)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "Read operations (requesting file content)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ""
    - content: "Write operations (creating or modifying content)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
  - content: "Azure HPC Cache is designed to run best when the data is what size?"
    choices:
    - content: "Kilobyte (KB) files in a megabyte (MB) working set"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Smaller files and data sets are not ideal for Azure HPC Cache."
    - content: "Megabyte (MB) files in a gigabyte (GB) working set"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache can accelerate these workloads, but they are not typically cost effective."
    - content: "Gigabyte (GB) files in a terabyte (TB) working set"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's right. Gigabyte-sized files are ideal in a working set that is terabytes in size."
  - content: "Which of the following is the best reason why Azure HPC Cache would not be a good fit for accelerating users' personal data files?"
    choices:
    - content: "Personal data files are not to be shared with others because they are private."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Personal data files may or may not be private. This does not affect how the cache works."
    - content: "Personal data files are not being accessed by several clients."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes. A cache is most efficient when it's being accessed by several clients at the same time."
    - content: "Personal data files are not sensitive and do not need to be encrypted."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All files are encrypted in Azure HPC Cache. File sensitivity and encryption do not make the cache a good fit or bad fit."
  - content: "Suppose a genetic research company is considering Azure HPC Cache for a workload that compares gigabyte DNA files to the same reference DNA file. They use hundreds of cloud clients running an NFS workload. What would make this good fit even better?"
    choices:
    - content: "If they installed a load balancer to distribute the workload."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A load balancer would not affect the Azure HPC Cache."
    - content: "If they installed a proxy server to handle network traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Proxy servers would not affect the Azure HPC Cache."
    - content: "If they installed an ExpressRoute to maximize bandwidth."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes. An ExpressRoute will maximize bandwidth between their clients in the cloud and their data on premises."
