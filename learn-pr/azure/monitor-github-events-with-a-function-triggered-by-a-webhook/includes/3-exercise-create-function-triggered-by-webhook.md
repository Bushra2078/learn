In this first exercise, you'll create your code to parse the GitHub wiki event messages in Azure Functions. You'll configure your function to run when a webhook message is received.

## Create a Function App

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using your MS Learn account.

1. Select **Create a resource**. The **Create a resource** pane appears.
2. In the menu, under **Categories** select **Compute**, and then search for **Function App** and select it. The **Create Function App** pane appears.

    [!include[](../../includes/functions-classic-workaround.md)]

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Function App Name must be unique. We suggest using something like **\<*your name or initials*\>triggerapp**. Use this name wherever you see *\<your-functionapp-name\>* in this exercise.

    | Setting  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | **Project Details** |
    | Subscription | Concierge Subscription  |
    | Resource Group | Select the sandbox resource group, _<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>_. |
    | **Instance Details** |
    | Function App Name | *\<your-functionapp-name\>* |
    | Publish | Code |
    | Runtime stack | Node.js |
    | Version | *default* |
    | Region | Choose the nearest location to you that is also one of the allowed *Sandbox regions*. |

    [!include[](../../../includes/azure-sandbox-regions-first-mention-note-friendly.md)]

1. Select **Next : Hosting** to open the **Hosting** tab. Enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting  | Value  |
    | --- | ---| 
    | **Storage** |
    | Storage account | (New), and accept the default name. |
    | **Operating system** |
    | Operating System | Windows |
    | **Plan** |
    | Plan type | Consumption (Serverless) |

1. Select **Review + create**. 

1. Azure verifies your entries. When verified, select **Create**. Deployment details display the **Overview** pane for your function.
 
## Create a webhook triggered function

1. When your deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**. The **Overview** pane for your **Function App** appears.

1. In the resource menu, under **Functions**, select **Functions**. The **Functions** pane appears.

1. On the command bar, select **Create**. In a moment, the **Create function** pane appears.

1. In the list of available templates, select **HTTP trigger**, and then select **Create**. The **HttpTrigger1** pane appears, displaying configuration essentials for your new trigger.

1. In the resource menu, select **Code + Test**. The **Code + Test** pane appears, displaying the JavaScript file that was created from the template. It should look like the following code.

    ```JavaScript
    module.exports = async function (context, req) {
        context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

        const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
        const responseMessage = name
            ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
            : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

        context.res = {
            // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
            body: responseMessage
        };
    }
    ```

    The *index.js* file is the JavaScript function generated by the portal. The request reads name, either passed in as a query string or as part of the request body, and responds with a "Hello" message.

1. Above the code is the path with a dropdown list showing the file name. In the dropdown list, select **function.json**. The JSON file that was created by the the template appears. It should look like the following code.

    ```JSON
    {
        "bindings": [
            {
                "authLevel": "function",
                "type": "httpTrigger",
                "direction": "in",
                "name": "req",
                "methods": [
                    "get",
                    "post"
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": "http",
                "direction": "out",
                "name": "res"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    The JSON bindings specify that the function is triggered by HTTP GET and POST requests directed towards the URL of the function app.

## Test triggering your function

1. In the command bar, select **Get function URL**.

1. In the **Get function URL** dialog box, in the **Key** dropdown list, under **Function key**, select **default**. In the **URL** field,  select the **Copy to clipboard** icon. The URL will look something like this: https://jafunctionapp.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?code=56/KXqbkP2Qrqqh4q6CPlDTRtQmkNg3maA1H20aRblw9v87/Wwc9ew==

    ```text
    https://<your-functionapp-name>.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?code=aUjXIpqdJ0ZHPQuB0SzFegxGJu0nAXmsQBnmkCpJ6RYxleRaoxJ8cQ==
    ```

1. Paste this URL into a browser, and at the end of URL, append the query string parameter: &name=*\<yourname\>*, for example &name=Dick and Jane.

1. To execute the request, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The response returned by the function appears in the browser. It will look something like this:

    ```text
    Hello Dick and Jane. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.
    ```

Congratulations! You now have a function that can be triggered by a URL.
