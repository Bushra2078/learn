In this first exercise, you'll create your code to parse the GitHub wiki event messages in Azure Functions. You'll configure your function to run when a webhook message is received.

## Create a Function App

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using your MS Learn account.

1. Select **+ Create a resource**, and then select **Compute** > **Function App**.

    [!include[](../../includes/functions-classic-workaround.md)]

1. On the **Function App** page, enter the following settings.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The function app must have a unique name. We suggest using something like **\<*your name or initials*\>triggerapp**. Use this name wherever you see *\<your-functionapp-name\>* in this exercise.

    | Property  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Subscription | Concierge Subscription  |
    | Resource Group | Select **Use existing** and choose the sandbox resource group, _<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>_. |
    | Name | *\<your-functionapp-name\>* |
    | Publish | Code |
    | Runtime stack | **Node.js** |
    | Version | *default* |
    | Region | Choose the nearest location to you that is also one of the allowed *Sandbox regions*. |

    [!include[](../../../includes/azure-sandbox-regions-first-mention-note-friendly.md)]
    
1. Select **Next : Hosting**.
    
    | Property  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Storage account | (New), and accept the default name. |
    | O/S | Windows |
    | Plan | Consumption (Serverless) |

1. Select **Review + Create**. The **Create Function App** page appears.

1. On the **Create Function App** page, select **Create**. Wait for the function app to be deployed before continuing.

## Create a webhook triggered function

1. From the Azure portal home page, find and select **All resources**, and then select the function app you just created.

1. On the Function App page, below the **Search** field, under the **Functions** section, select **Functions**. Next, from the menu bar, select **+ Add**. The **Add function** panel appears.

1. In the **Add function** panel, under **Select a template**, select **HTTP trigger**, and then select **Add**.

   The portal will create a JavaScript function that looks similar to this. In the left nav bar, select **Code + Test** to view it. The following JavaScript appears.

    ```JavaScript
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

    const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
    const responseMessage = name
        ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
        : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: responseMessage
    };
}
    ```

    This is the default JavaScript function generated by the portal. It reads a name, either passed in as a query string or as part of the request body, and responds with a "Hello" message.

1. In the path above the code box, from the dropdown, select **function.json**.

    ```JSON
    {
        "bindings": [
            {
                "authLevel": "function",
                "type": "httpTrigger",
                "direction": "in",
                "name": "req",
                "methods": [
                    "get",
                    "post"
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": "http",
                "direction": "out",
                "name": "res"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    The binding specifies that the function is triggered by HTTP GET and POST requests directed towards the URL of the function app.

## Test triggering your function

1. In your new function, in the top menu bar, select **Get function URL**.

1. In the **Get function URL** message box, in the **Key** dropdown, under **Function key**, select **default**. In the **URL** field,  select he **Copy to clipboard** icon. The URL will look something like this:

    ```text
    https://<your-functionapp-name>.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?code=aUjXIpqdJ0ZHPQuB0SzFegxGJu0nAXmsQBnmkCpJ6RYxleRaoxJ8cQ==
    ```

1. Paste your function URL into your browser's address bar. On the end of this URL, append the query string value: &name=*\<yourname\>*.

1. To execute the request, press Enter. The response returned by the function appears in the browser. It will look something like this:

    ```text
    Hello John Smith. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.
    ```

Congratulations! You now have a function that can be triggered by a URL.
