In this exercise, you'll update your function to parse information from the GitHub webhook payload, and display the results.

## Update your function to parse the webhook payload

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Function App that you created earlier.

1. On the **Function App** pane, in the left menu under **Functions** section, select select **Functions**, and then select the HttpTrigger you created.

1. In the resource menu for your Http Trigger function select **Code + Test**, and in the path above the code, select **index.js** from the dropdown list. The javascript for your trigger displays. 

1. Update the code by replacinge the current `if...else` statement in the function body with the following code.

    ```JavaScript
    if (req.body.pages[0].title){
        context.res = {
            body: "Page is " + req.body.pages[0].title + ", Action is " + req.body.pages[0].action + ", Event Type is " + req.headers['x-github-event']
        };
    }
    else {
        context.res = {
            status: 400,
            body: ("Invalid payload for Wiki event")
        }
    }
    ```

    This code retrieves the event type from the request header, and the title and action fields from the message body. This information indicates that page has changed, and whether it has been edited or newly created. The code constructs a response that summarizes the action.

1. Select **Save**.

## Trigger your Azure Function with a Gollum event

1. Return to your GitHub account.

1. Select the repository you are using for this module.

1. In the top menu bar, select **Settings**.

1. In the left menu pane, select **Webhooks**. The **Webhooks** page appears.

1. Select **Edit** for your webhook.

1. On the Webhooks/Manage webhook page, scroll down to the **Recent Deliveries** section.

1. Select the latest delivery entry by clicking the ellipsis button (...).

1. Select **Redeliver**.

1. In the message box that appears, select **Yes, redeliver this payload**. This action simulates you changing your Wiki page again.

1. Select the **Response** tab. You'll see how the webhook, has triggered your function, which then parsed the information and sent back a response similar to the following text:

    ```text
    Page is Home, Action is edited, Event Type is gollum
    ```
