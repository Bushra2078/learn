  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following helper methods won't help you if you need to eliminate the char `-` from a string?"
    choices:
    - content: "IndexOfAny()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  Since we already know that we only need to eliminate the char `-` from a string, we should prefer using `IndexOf()` instead."
    - content: "Remove()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, the `Remove()` method could easily eliminate a char from a string."
    - content: "IndexOf()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `IndexOf()` could be used to find the position of the char `-` in a string.  You would then use `Replace()` to eliminate it."
    - content: "Replace()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, the `Replace()` method could easily eliminate a char from a string."
  - content: "What is a constant variable?"
    choices:
    - content: "A magic string or number."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A constant might be used to replace a magic string or number, but they aren't the same thing."
    - content: "A variable whose name must match its value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A constant's value is not constrained by its name."
    - content: "A variable that can only be used in the scope of the method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While a constant's scope is the same as any local variable, that isn't the purpose of a constant."
    - content: "A value that once initialized can never be changed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
