Suppose you're the IT administrator for a musical group's website that's hosted on Azure virtual machines (VMs). The website runs mission-critical services for the group, including ticket booking, venue information, and tour updates. The website must respond quickly and remain accessible during frequent updates and spikes in traffic.

You need to maintain sufficient VM size and memory to effectively host the website without incurring unnecessary costs. You also need to proactively prevent and quickly respond to any access, security, and performance issues. To achieve these objectives, you want to quickly and easily monitor your server and client VMs' traffic, health, performance, and events.

Azure VMs come with built-in and customizable monitoring abilities that you can use to track the health, performance, and behavior of the systems, workloads, and websites. This learning module shows you how to use built-in metrics and alert rules, Azure Monitor VM Insights, and custom data collection rules (DCRs) to collect and analyze the data you need from all your VMs and Azure resources.

## Prerequisites

To complete this module, you need the following prerequisites:

- At least **Contributor** role access to an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) and add a subscription before you begin. If you're a student, you can take advantage of the [Azure for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?azure-portal=true) offer.
- Familiarity with virtualization and Azure VMs.

## Learning objectives

- Explore built-in host metrics and set up recommended alerts.
- Use Metrics Explorer to create customized metrics charts.
- Enable and configure VM Insights to collect and display client and workload metrics.
- Define a data collection rule (DCR) to collect event logs from VMs.
