As the administrator for your band's website hosted on Azure, you need to monitor the performance and behavior of the website. The band is on tour next month, so you're expecting a spike in traffic. The website must be accessible by your fans during the tour. The website is running mission-critical services, including ticket booking, venue information, tour dates, and more. This information is vital for the band, so you want a simple way to monitor the health of the virtual machine. You need to know when the traffic spikes so you can take the appropriate action.

In this module, you'll evaluate monitoring options for an Azure virtual machine. With the monitoring in place, you'll enable client diagnostics to get client data. Finally, you'll set up alerts to respond to specific metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with virtualization and Azure virtual machines

## Learning objectives

- Identify metrics and diagnostic data that you can collect for virtual machines
- Configure monitoring for a virtual machine
- Use monitoring data to diagnose problems
