As the administrator for your band's website hosted on Azure, you need to monitor the performance and behavior of the website. The band is on tour next month, so you're expecting a spike in traffic. The website must be accessible by your fans during the tour. 

The website is running mission-critical services, including ticket booking, venue information, and tour dates. This information is vital for the band, so you want a simple way to monitor the health of the virtual machine hosting the website. You need to know when the traffic spikes so you can take the appropriate action.
