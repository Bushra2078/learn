Azure allows you to take action on the metrics you're capturing. You can create alerts that email you, or start automations with runbooks. 

Now you'll create an alert based on your web server's CPU usage. If the CPU usage goes above the set threshold of 90 percent for five minutes, you get an email.

In this unit, you'll add an alert for your VM. Then you'll cause the VM CPU usage to spike, and receive the alert email.

## Create an alert based on CPU usage

If CPU usage goes above 90 percent for one minute, you'd like to get a notification. 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) and sign in with the account that you used to enable the sandbox.
1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Virtual machines**.
1. Select the **monitored-linux-vm** virtual machine that you created.
1. On the left, scroll down and select **Metrics**.
1. Select **New alert rule**.

### Select the resource

1. Under **Scope**, click the **Select resource** link.
1. In the **Filter by resource type** field, select **Virtual machines**.
1. Under **Resource**, select **monitored-linux-vm**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the VM selected on the pane for selecting a resource](../media/8-alert-select-a-resource-vm.png)

1. Select **Done**.

### Create the condition

1. Under **Condition**, select **Select condition** link.
1. Under **Signal name**, select **Percentage CPU**.

1. Select **Done**.

### Add an action

1. Under **Action group**, select **Select action group**.
1. Select **Create action group**.
1. Use the following values:

   ![Screenshot that shows the "Add action group" pane filled out](../media/8-add-action-group-pane.png)

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---|---|

    |Short name        | Emails              |
    |Subscription       | Concierge Subscription               |
    |Resource group       | <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>                |
    |Action name     | High CPU usage       |
    |Action type      | Email/SMS/Push/Voice |

1. In the **Email/SMS/Push/Voice** pane, select **Email**, and enter your email address to receive the alert notification.

1. Select **OK**.
1. In the **Add action group** pane, select **OK**.
1. For **Alert rule details**, use the following values:

   ![Screenshot that shows the fields for alert details](../media/8-alert-details.png)

    |Field  |Value  |
    |---|---|
    |Alert rule name | Web server CPU running hot    |
    |Description     | Email alert notifies when the CPU is over 90%|

1. Select **Create alert rule**.

## Activate the alert

1. Go to the VM **Overview** pane.
1. Select **Connect** > **SSH**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the "Connect" button on the VM overview pane](../media/8-vm-overview-connect-button.png)

1. From the last step, copy the **azureuser**@ and IP address that follows.
1. In Azure Cloud Shell to the right, type **SSH** and paste what you copied in the previous step. It should look like the following command.

    ```bash
    ssh azureuser@<ipaddress>
    ```

    If Cloud Shell times out, select **Reconnect**.
1. When you're prompted, enter **yes** to connect to the VM.
1. Run the following command to install the stress tool on the VM.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install stress
    ```
1. Run the following command to stress the VM's CPU.

    ```bash
    sudo stress --cpu 16 -v -t 10m
    ```
1. Return to the Azure portal.
1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Dashboard** and then select **KPI Dashboard**.
1. On the **Max CPU percentage guest OS for monitored-linux-vm** graph, select the ellipses (**...**) on the upper right, and then select **Refresh**.
1. After a few minutes, the CPU should approach 100 percent and you'll receive an alert email.
