Azure enables you to take action on the metrics you're capturing. You can create alerts that email you, or start automations with runbooks. 

Now, you'll create an alert based on your web server's CPU usage. If the CPU usage goes above the set threshold of 90 percent for five minutes, you get an email.

In this unit, you'll add an alert for your VM. Next, you'll cause the VM CPU usage to spike, and receive the alert email.

## Create an alert based on CPU usage

If CPU usage goes above 90 percent for one minute, you'd like to get a notification. 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) and sign in with the account that you used to enable the sandbox.

1. On the Azure portal menu, or from the **Home** page, select **Virtual machines**.

1. Select the **monitored-linux-vm** virtual machine that you created.

1. On the left menu pane, scroll down, and select **Metrics**.

1. Select **New alert rule**.

### Select the resource

1. Under **Scope**, click the **Select resource** link.

1. In the **Filter by resource type** field, select **Virtual machines**.

1. Under **Resource**, select **monitored-linux-vm**.

1. Select **Done**.

### Create the condition

1. Under **Condition**, select **Add condition** link.

1. Under **Signal name**, select **Percentage CPU**.

1. Select **Create alert rule**.

Wait a few minutes for this rule to activate.

## Trigger the alert

1. Go to the VM **Overview** pane.

1. Select **Connect**, and then select **SSH**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the "Connect" button on the VM overview pane](../media/8-vm-overview-connect-button.png)

1. From the last step, copy the **azureuser**@ and IP address that follows.

1. In Azure Cloud Shell to the right, enter **SSH**, and paste what you copied in the previous step. It should look like the following command.

    ```bash
    ssh azureuser@<ipaddress>
    ```

    If Cloud Shell times out, select **Reconnect**.

1. When you're prompted, enter **yes** to connect to the VM.

1. Run the following command to install the stress tool on the VM.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install stress
    ```

1. Run the following command to stress the VM's CPU.

    ```bash
    sudo stress --cpu 16 -v -t 10m
    ```

1. Return to the Azure portal.

1. On the Azure portal menu, or from the **Home** page, select **Dashboard**, and then select **KPI Dashboard**.

1. On the **Max CPU percentage guest OS for monitored-linux-vm** graph, select the ellipses (**...**) on the upper right, and then select **Refresh**.

1. After a few minutes, the CPU should approach 100 percent, and you'll receive an alert email.
