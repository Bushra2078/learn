The last time your band went on tour, your website went down while your fans were trying to buy tickets. You're not sure if the web server ran out of memory, or if the VM wasn't the right size. For your new tour, you'd like a dashboard to keep track of the VM's traffic, memory, and CPU usage.

In this exercise, you'll install the Azure Diagnostics extension on your new VM to collect near real-time metrics for the OS level. After you install the extension, you'll change the sample rate to every minute. Then, you'll create a KPI dashboard to view the new metrics being captured.

## Install the Azure Diagnostics extension

Use the portal to enable guest-level metric monitoring of the VM. When you enable this monitoring, Azure installs and configures the Azure Diagnostics extension for you.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) and sign in with the account that you used to enable the sandbox.
1. In the menu on the left, select **Virtual machines**.
1. Select the **monitored-linux-vm** virtual machine that you created.
1. On the left, scroll down until you see the **Monitoring** section, and then select **Diagnostic settings**.

1. Select **Enable guest-level monitoring**.

1. Wait until the diagnostic settings are configured. This process might take a minute.

## Configure the extension

1. After the extension is installed, you'll see the **Overview** page.
1. Select **Metrics**.
