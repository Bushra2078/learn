In this module, you evaluated the monitoring options for an Azure virtual machine. You identified metrics and diagnostic data you can collect from virtual machines. Also, you viewed virtual machine metrics available to measure performance and saw how to create alerts if the metric is triggered. In the exercises, you enabled client diagnostics to get client data. You viewed various metrics and created an alert to monitor performance. As the alert criteria were met, you had an email notification. You can use tools in Azure to obtain detailed information about a virtual machine's state. You learned to set up alerts to respond to specific metrics.
