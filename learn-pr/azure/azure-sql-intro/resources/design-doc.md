# Title

Introduction to Azure SQL  
(Azure SQL fundamentals learning path 1/6)

## Role(s)

- Data Engineer
- Solution Architect
- Developer
- Technology manager

## Level

- Intermediate

## Product(s)

- Azure SQL Database
- Azure SQL Managed Instance
- Azure VM
- SQL Server 2019

## Prerequisites

- Understand and are experienced in working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server. If you are new to this, you can review the following book by Bob Ward: [Pro SQL Server on Linux.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pro-sql-server/9781484241288/) This book (available online) introduces SQL Server on Linux, but in the process walks through fundamental SQL Server topics
- Familiarity with the general structure of Azure will be helpful, but not required. The [Azure fundamentals learning path](/training/paths/azure-fundamentals/) will help you understand the fundamentals of Azure at a general level (not data focused).  

## Summary

In this hands-on, scenario-driven module, you'll learn how to translate your existing SQL Server expertise to Azure SQL including Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instance. At the end of the module, you should have a foundational knowledge of what to use when. You will learn about not only the "what", but also the "how" and the "why". Starting with a brief history of why and how we built Azure SQL, you'll then learn about the various deployment options and service tiers, including what to use when. This includes Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instance. Understanding what Platform as a Service (PaaS) encompasses and how it compares to the SQL Server "box" will help level-set what you get (and don't get) when you move to the cloud.

## Learning objectives

After this module, you should be able to:
<br>

- Determine which Azure SQL deployment option (virtual machines, single databases, serverless databases, elastic pools of databases, hyperscale databases, and managed instances) and service tier should be used for scenarios that meet the needs of your application.
- Translate your existing SQL Server expertise to Azure SQL expertise.
