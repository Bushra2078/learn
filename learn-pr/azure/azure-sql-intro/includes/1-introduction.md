Many organizations are faced with an aging or under-engineered data platform strategy. There's been a significant trend of moving existing systems to the cloud, building new applications quickly with the cloud, and offloading some of the on-premises costs. You need a plan for how to move some workloads to the cloud, and you need to understand how to set up your organization for success. You also need to understand how the role of a database administrator (DBA) or data professional stays the same, and what changes you'll have to make.  

In this module, you'll start with a brief history of why and how we built Azure SQL, then you'll then learn about the various deployment options and service tiers, including what to use when for your organization. This includes Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL managed instance, and SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine. Understanding what platform as a service (PaaS) encompasses and how it compares to a traditional SQL Server will help level set what you do and don't get when you move to the cloud.  

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:  

- Describe the evolution of SQL Server in Azure.
- Determine which deployment option is best for workloads in your organization.
- Select the purchasing models, service tiers, and hardware that best fits a workload.

## Prerequisites

- Experience working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server
- Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources

This module expects that you understand and are experienced in working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server. Having some familiarity with the general structure of Azure will be helpful, but not required, before completing this module.
