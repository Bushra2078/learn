In this module, you'll start with a brief history of why and how we built Azure SQL, then you'll then learn about the various deployment options and service tiers, including what to use when. This includes Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instance. Understanding what Platform as a Service (PaaS) encompasses and how it compares to the SQL Server "box" will help level-set what you get (and don't get) when you move to the cloud.
