      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Establish a dedicated identity subscription in the Platform management group to host Windows server Active Directory domain controllers, when necessary.'
    - content: 'Use the following principles when identifying requirements for new subscriptions: Scale Limits, Management boundary, Policy boundary, and target network topology.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'This is the correct answer.'
    - content: 'Use a rigid subscription model to hemp maintain proper governance across the organization'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Avoid a rigid subscription model, and opt instead for a set of flexible criteria to group subscriptions across the organization. This flexibility ensures that as your organization's structure and workload composition changes, you can create new subscription groups instead of using a fixed set of existing subscriptions. One size doesn't fit all for subscriptions. What works for one business unit might not work for another. Some apps might coexist within the same landing zone subscription while others might require their own subscription."
