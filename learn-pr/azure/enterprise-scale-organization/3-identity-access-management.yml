  questions:

  - content: How should resource-to-resource authentication occur?
    choices:
    - content: By using managed identities for Azure resources
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This feature provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Azure Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.​
    - content: By using password-based authentication
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Password-based authentication is a static method and not a best practice because securely storing these credentials creates management overhead.​
    - content: Use Azure Key Vault
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Key Vault provides storage for your keys and secrets, but it's not responsible for initiating authentication.

  - content: It's a best practice for subscription owners to have write permissions for Microsoft.Authorization and also to have contributor role permissions.
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ''
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Subscription owners should have contributor rights to resources within the subscription that aren't centrally shared. Grant write permissions for Microsoft.Authorization, which is centrally managed. This allows the owner to modify permissions that limit their scope, remove separation, and could pose security risks.
