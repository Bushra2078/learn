The threat modeling process for an application to be used in the secured environment begins with a set of security assessment questions.

These questions help us in three different ways:

- Uncover functionality and integration risks before installing the application,
- Help visualize how the application integrates with the environment, and
- Which security controls work best to help reduce or eliminate risks.

The questions below are a great starting point. You may add more depending on your specific needs.
