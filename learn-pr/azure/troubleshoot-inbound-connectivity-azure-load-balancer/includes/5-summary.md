In this module, you've learned how to troubleshoot connectivity for Azure Load Balancer. You've looked at identifying common inbound connectivity issues with Load Balancer, and resolving problems with virtual machine health probes.

In the sample scenario, you can use this knowledge to identify the problems introduced by the other administrator when making changes to the network configuration. You can determine how these changes have prevented Load Balancer from working properly. You can then take the necessary steps to fix the problem.
