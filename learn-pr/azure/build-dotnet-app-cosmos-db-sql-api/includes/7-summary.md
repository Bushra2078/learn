Your developer team needed a .NET application that connects to Azure Cosmos DB SQL API. This application implements common operations using the SDK and illustrates best practices for your team to follow.

You authored an application that created and managed databases, containers, and items. Your application also used the SQL query language and LINQ to perform queries on items in Azure Cosmos DB.

TODO: add your list of techniques used to solve the scenario problem

<!-- 3. Describe the experience without the product ---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe what would be required to solve the problem without using the product; be brief (1-2 sentences)

    Heading: none; typically this will be a new paragraph

    Example: "Fire extinguishers are critical safety equipment for both homes and businesses. Despite their importance, many customers don't read the instructions ahead of time. Confusing instructions could mean customers don't use the extinguisher correctly when they're needed. This can result in loss of property or life."

TODO: describe the experience without the product

With the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, you were able to illustrate the best way to create, manage, and query data. The .NET SDK made it possible to share a concise sample with your development team that focused solely on the code necessary for them to be successful.

<!-- 5. References (optional) ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide a few recommendations for further study via a bulleted list of links. This is optional and intended to be used sparingly.        - use the target page title as the text for your link
        - do not include other text such as a description
        - prefer other first-party sites like Docs reference pages
        - link to third-party sites only when they are trusted and authoritative
        - do not link to other Learn content ("next steps" recommendations are generated automatically)
        - avoid linking to opinion sites such as blog posts

    Heading: "## References"

    Example:
        "## References
          * [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles)
