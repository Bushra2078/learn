Your developer team needed a .NET application that connects to Azure Cosmos DB SQL API. This application implements common operations using the SDK and illustrates best practices for your team to follow.

While there's a REST API for Azure Cosmos DB, developing using the REST API can be challenging for a team that's new to use the platform. Additionally, your application would need to implement a series of common best practices including fault handling logic, retry strategies, and even logic to convert C# expressions to valid SQL API queries.

You authored an application that used the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB. The application created and managed databases, containers, and items. Your application also used the SQL query language and LINQ method syntax to perform queries on items in Azure Cosmos DB.

With the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, you were able to illustrate the best way to create, manage, and query data. The .NET SDK made it possible to share a concise sample with your development team that focused solely on the code necessary for them to be successful.
