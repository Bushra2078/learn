In this module, you learned how to create an Azure Logic Apps custom connector. To connect workflows in Azure Logic Apps to a custom REST API, you describe that API by supplying a definition in OpenAPI format or a Postman collection. You can then call functions in that API as actions in any logic app workflow.

Now that you've created a custom connector, you can also use that connector with Power Automate and Power Apps.
