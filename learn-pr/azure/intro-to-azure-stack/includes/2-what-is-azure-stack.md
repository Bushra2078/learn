Cloud computing isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. Customers can choose to use the cloud to whatever extent they deem necessary in order to fulfill their business requirements. Efficient use of cloud technologies is not limited to migration scenarios, but also plays a very significant role in hybrid environments, with some computing resources remaining in on-premises datacenters. When using Azure as the public cloud, customers such as Contoso, can optimize that hybrid model, by leveraging the Azure Stack offering. 

## What is Azure Stack?

Azure Stack is a family of products that provide an extension of Azure to consistently build and run hybrid applications across datacenters, edge locations, remote offices, and cloud. Azure Stack family consists of Azure Stack Hub, Azure Stack HCI, and Azure Stack Edge. 

As part of its hybrid cloud strategy, Microsoft has structured its offerings in a way that helps provide a clear implementation path for customers seeking to innovate the way they provision and manage their on-premises workloads. As a result, Microsoft has rebranded Microsoft Azure Stack, which it introduced in 2017, as Azure Stack Hub. In addition, in November 2019, Microsoft announced two additional products named Azure Stack Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) and Azure Stack Edge. Each of these products is intended to address different sets of needs, which this module will explore in further detail. The different features and functionalities of these three products of the Azure Stack family complement each other.

Despite their differences, the Azure Stack products share some characteristics that facilitate transition to the hybrid cloud model by using the following Azure-based capabilities:

- On-premises deployments
- Close integration with Azure
- Modern technologies that accelerate replacement and consolidation of legacy infrastructure
- Pay-as-you-use pricing, leveraging the same subscriptions, monetary commitments, and billing tools as Azure

## Azure Arc and Azure Stack

Azure Arc consists of a set of technologies that you can use to simplify administration of complex, distributed, hybrid environments. It provides a centralized, scalable, and consistent multi-cloud and on-premises governance and management platform. It facilitates adoption of DevOps practices such as desired state configuration and automation, delivers built-in monitoring and security, and promotes the cloud-first strategy, regardless of where your resources are located. At the same time, Azure Arc still allows you to continue using traditional ITOps tools and practices, as you transition to the the DevOps model to fully benefit from cloud native architectural and operational patterns.

Azure Arc delivers further integration between management of Azure services and on-premises infrastructure. Azure Arc and Azure Stack complement each other. You can combine the benefits of Azure Arc with Azure Stack where Azure Arc can manage virtualized and containerized workloads running on Azure Stack hardware, leveraging the compute and cloud capabilities of Azure Stack.
