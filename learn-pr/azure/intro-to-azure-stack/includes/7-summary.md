As Contoso considered its move to the Azure, the IT team needed to find a way to host various VDI deployments and SQL servers. Given the characteristics of Contoso's on-premises workloads, you determined that Azure Stack HCI would be the most suitable platform for the VDI farm and for the multitier application consisting of a pair of clustered Linux Ubuntu 18.04 servers and a SQL Server Always On availability group. Azure Stack HCI clusters were well suited for hosting VDI deployments and mission-critical SQL Server deployments. In each case, you benefited from an extra layer of resiliency inherent to Azure Stack HCI. The use of clustered Linux Ubuntu 18.04 servers didn't present any particular challenges, because Azure Stack HCI supports both Windows and Linux VMs.

In this module, you learned about Azure Stack HCI and its various related apps, such as Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge. While they could have hosted these workloads on Azure Stack Hub, that would have required changes to Contoso's operational model and retraining its IT staff. Because Azure Stack HCI didn't limit direct access to underlying hardware, its operational model didn't differ from the one applicable to traditional on-premises Windows Server deployments. Considering that Contoso's internal IT staff is well-versed in Microsoft technologies, they were well prepared for transitioning to the new platform. It was a straightforward process to extend the scope of existing on-premises administrative tools and processes, to facilitate management of the Azure Stack HCI cluster and its workloads.

As server administrator, you discovered the many benefits of Azure Stack and now you can share them with the IT team at Contoso so they can host their deployments effectively. Contoso will benefit from the compatibility of Azure Stack HCI with the majority of popular third-party backup, security, and monitoring software. In addition, Azure Stack HCI will facilitate integration with a number of Azure cloud services from which Contoso is already benefiting, such as Azure Monitor.
