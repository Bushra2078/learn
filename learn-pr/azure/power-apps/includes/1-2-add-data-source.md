Information is a vital part of the application, including in power apps. Data is stored in a data source and use a connection to get it into your program. The connection utilizes a particular connector to converse with the data source. Many significant services and on-premises data sources, such as SharePoint, SQL Server, Office 365, Salesforce, and Twitter, have connectors in Power Apps.

A connector might give tables of information or actions. A few connectors give just tables, some give just actions, and some give both. Likewise, your connector might be either a standard or custom connector.

## Popular connectors

* **SharePoint** - Connect to a SharePoint site to instantly produce an app from a custom list, or create a connection before adding data to an existing app or creating a new one.
* **Office 365 outlook** - User can view, send, delete, and reply to email messages and perform other actions when you connect to Office 365 Outlook.
* **SQL server** - Connect to SQL Server, whether in Azure or on-premises, to manage your data using operations including creating, reading, updating, and deleting.
* **Oracle** - After you make a connection and develop an app in Power Apps, you may list tables and create, read, update, and delete table rows in an Oracle database. Filtering, sorting, and other functions can be fully delegated using the Oracle Database connection, but triggers and stored procedures are not supported.
* **Office 365 users** - Using your Office 365 account, you can access user profiles inside your organization. For example, you can receive your profile, a user's profile, a user's manager, or direct reports, among other things.

## UI/UX components in power apps

In Microsoft Power Apps, users can plan and build a business application using components rather than writing code in a traditional programming language like C#. Instead, users can design applications by dragging and dropping components into a canvas, just as they would design a slide in PowerPoint. Make Excel-like experience for indicating logic and working with data. Create apps that combine business data from several Microsoft and third-party sources. Share the app so that users can run it in a browser or on a mobile device, and embed your app so they can run it in SharePoint, Power BI, or Teams.

## Controls and properties in canvas apps

* **Buttons** - Associate with the application by clicking or tapping.
* **Gallery** - Show a list of records that contain different sorts of data.
* **Drop down** - Shows the first item in a rundown until a chevron is selected.
* **Image** -  Show a picture from, for instance, a file or a data source.
* **Camera** -  Take and save photographs in the app or to a data source.
