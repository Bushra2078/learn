  questions:
 
  - content: "An administrator plans to use an Azure shared disk for their clustered database. Which of the following SQL deployment options can benefit from Azure shared disk?"
    choices:
    - content: "Single instance SQL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Single instance SQL is deployed on only one VM and doesn't require Azure shared disk."
    - content: "Always On Availability Group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Always On Availability group provides high available SQL deployment, but doesn't use Azure shared disks."
    - content: "SQL FCI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "SQL FCI leverages failover-cluster scenarios where multiple VMs access and use an Azure shared disk."
 
  - content: "Which of the following statements is true about Azure shared disks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Shared managed disks offer a fully managed file system that can be accessed using SMB/NFS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Shared managed disks don't natively offer a fully managed file system that can be accessed using SMB/NFS. You need to use a cluster manager, such as Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) or Pacemaker, that handles cluster node communication and write locking."
    - content: "I can use a shared disk as an OS Disk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can only use Azure shared disks as Data disks."
    - content: "You can use SCSI PR commands to enable failover from one node to another, when using Azure shared disks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure shared disks support SCSI PR standards. Once you've mounted the shared disk to your VMs in your cluster, you can establish a quorum and read/write to the disk using SCSI PR."
 
  - content: "An administrator plans to create an Azure VM that will use an Azure shared disk. Which of the following disk types can use the shared disk functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data disk"

      explanation: "The Azure shared disks can only be shared as data disks."
    - content: "OS disk"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure shared disks can only be shared as data disks."
    - content: "Temporary disk"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure shared disks can only be shared as data disks."
