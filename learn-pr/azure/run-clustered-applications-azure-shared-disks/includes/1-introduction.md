An important requirement for many organizations is to provide high availability for clustered or distributed applications. You can use Microsoft Azure shared disks to run clustered or high-availability applications.

Many organizations that are hosting data in the cloud have diverse requirements. Requirements might include storing data in a specific region or requiring separate billing for different data categories.
Suppose that you work at a financial-services company that uses Azure services extensively. Your Chief Technology Officer (CTO) wants to migrate several applications, databases, and support files to the cloud. Most of these applications are running in your on-premises system area network (SAN), which requires shared block storage. This migration will reduce the number of physical servers you must maintain in your datacenter. As part of your migration strategy, you must decide the best approach for your cloud-based storage infrastructure.

You're evaluating the functionality of Azure shared disks to determine whether it'll enable your organization to migrate clustered applications to Azure.
