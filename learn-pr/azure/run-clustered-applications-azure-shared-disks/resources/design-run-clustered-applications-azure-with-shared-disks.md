# Module topic statement

Providing high availability for clustered applications is an important requirement for most organizations. Microsoft Azure shared disks helps you do that by enabling you to run clustered or high-availability applications on Azure. 

# Subtasks in this module

- Identify use-case scenarios for Azure shared disks.
- Deploy clustered VMs by using Azure shared disks.

# Exercise

- Exercise – Deploy clustered VMs by using Azure shared disks:

   - Create Azure shared disks.
   - Create a proximity placement group.
   - Create two VMs.
   - Initialize Azure Shared Disks in the VMs.
   - Run SCSI persistent reservation (PR) commands against shared disks.

# Module learning objectives

After completing this module, you should know more about: 

- Azure shared disks.

## Unit descriptions

### First unit: Introduction

Type of unit: Introduction unit

Estimate unit duration: 3 minutes

#### Module scenario

Most organizations have diverse requirements for their cloud-hosted data. These might include storing data in a specific region or requiring separate billing for different data categories. 

Suppose that you work at a medium-size financial services company. Your company uses Azure services extensively, and your development team is creating architectures for new applications. Your Chief Technology Officer (CTO) wants to migrate several applications, databases, and support files to the cloud. This will reduce the number of physical servers your company maintains in your datacenter. As part of your migration strategy, you must decide the best approach for your cloud-based storage infrastructure.



Your CTO’s primary concern is the enterprise applications that’ll be harder to migrate. These include clustered databases, parallel file systems, and distributed applications  running in your on-premises SAN that require  shared block storage.

You must evaluate the functionality of Azure shared disks as a solution that’ll enable your organization to migrate clustered applications in Azure.

##### Resolution of module problem

Your organization can use Azure shared disks to migrate existing clustered or distributed applications from your on-premises environment to the cloud. 

You’ll benefit from shared access to high performance block storage with Ultra Disk and Premium SSDs and consistent sub-ms latency of Ultra Disk Storage for your most demanding workloads. Shared disk simplifies your ability to run clusters on Azure  offering a  balance of price and performance.

In this module, you learned about Azure shared disks and their benefits. You also learned how to create Azure Shared Disks and use them to deploy clustered VMs.
