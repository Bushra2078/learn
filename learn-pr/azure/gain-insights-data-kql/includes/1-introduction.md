Kusto Query Language (KQL) lets you explore your data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, and create statistical models. 

## Example scenario

You're a data analyst with a passion for meteorological data. You want to use KQL to explore and prepare a dataset that will enable you to answer basic questions about the kinds and locations of storms in the US. In particular, you want to compare the impact of different types of storms in different locations.

## What will we be doing?

You'll write queries in the Kusto Query Language (KQL) to explore and gain insights from a sample dataset. You'll learn how to:

* Group data using aggregation functions
* Count events using the `count` operator
* Visualize data using the `render` operator
* Summarize data using `avg`, `min`, and `max` operators
* Introduce variables using the `let` function

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to write advanced queries in Kusto Query Language and visually render the results to gain insights from your data.
