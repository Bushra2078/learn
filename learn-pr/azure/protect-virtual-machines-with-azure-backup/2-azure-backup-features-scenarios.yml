  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which is the best way to back up an entire Linux Azure virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: Use the Azure Backup extension
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure Backup works on Azure VMs without the need to install an agent. It meets the goal of a disk level backup.
    - content: Use the MABS or DPM agent
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The MABS or DPM agents could be used in this scenario, but the agents would need be installed and configured, which would require more effort to achieve the same goal as the Azure Backup agent. 
    - content: Use the MARS agent
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The MARS agent doesn't support Linux. 
  - content: "Why would you use MABS or DPM instead of the MARS agent to do backups?"
    choices:
    - content: File and folder level backups are required.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All agents support file and folder level backups.
    - content: Physical Windows and Linux backups are required.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: It's true that MABS or DPM agents support Windows and Linux **VM** backups. However, there are no options to support physical Linux backups at the moment. 
    - content: Backing up of running apps are required.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Only MABS and DPM support app-aware backups.
