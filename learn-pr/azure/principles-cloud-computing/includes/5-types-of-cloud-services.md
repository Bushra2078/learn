When talking about cloud computing, there are three categories that all computing services fall into. It's important to understand these categories because they are used in conversation, documentation, and training.

Here are the three common cloud service categories:

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Software as a service (SaaS)

One thing to pay attention to is that these categories are layers on top of each other. For example, PaaS adds a layer on top of IaaS by providing a level of abstraction. The abstraction has the benefit of hiding the details that you may not care about so that you can get to coding quicker, however, a cost of that is losing control over the underlying hardware.

### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a service is the most flexible category of cloud services and aims to give you complete control over the hardware that will run your application. Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you're renting it.

Here are some examples of IaaS:

- Virtual machines
- Firewalls
- Hard disks
- Load balancers

### Platform as a service (PaaS)

Platform as a service provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an application as quickly as possible without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates. 

An example of PaaS is Azure App Service.

### Software as a service (SaaS)

Software as a service provides a way to deliver applications over the internet. A SaaS application is most commonly called a web-based application; however, the term SaaS application comes from the fact that the application is hosted on a SaaS provider's server. With SaaS, you don't have to worry about installation or setup, you just use it through a web browser or software application. 

An example of a SaaS application is Microsoft Office 365.

## Summary

IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS all layer on top of each other. Your need of control over the underlying hardware will determine what category of services would work best for you.
