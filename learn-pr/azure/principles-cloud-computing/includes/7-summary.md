Throughout this module, we looked at what cloud computing is and how it can help every business whether it's a start-up or large enterprise. At this point we know what cloud computing is, however, we haven't talked about a cloud provider.

### Microsoft Azure

Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Azure provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.
