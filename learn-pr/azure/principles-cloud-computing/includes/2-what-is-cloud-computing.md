Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. The computing services offered tend to vary by cloud provider, however, typically they include:

- Compute power
- Storage
- Applications
- Networking
- Analytics

## What is a cloud provider?

A cloud provider is a third-party company that provides cloud computing services and has the physical hardware to successfully execute your work.

## Cloud computing services

The goal of cloud computing is to make it easier and more efficient to run a business whether you're a small start-up or a large enterprise. Every business is unique and has different needs, and because of that, cloud providers offer a wide range of services.

To understand exactly what cloud computing is, you need to have a basic understanding of some of the services provided by it. Let's briefly discuss the two most common services that all cloud providers offer.

### Compute power

Everyday you're using compute power whether you know it or not. If you're sending an email, browsing a website, or even checking the weather, there is hardware behind the scenes doing work on your behalf. 

As a developer using cloud computing, you have the flexibility of choosing how you want work to be done based off your resources and needs. For example, if you want to have more control and responsibility of maintenance, you could create a virtual machine. If you wanted to have less control and not worry about the underlying hardware, you could use a serverless approach. 

### Storage

Our devices are constantly collecting data. From a user registering a new account to a selfie being taken with a smart phone.

Data comes in all different shapes and sizes like: text, image, and video and cloud providers typically offer services that can handle all. For example, if you wanted to store text you could use a file on disk or you could take a more structured approach like using a relational database.

## Summary

Every business has different needs and requirements and because of that cloud computing is flexible and cost efficient. Whether you're a small start-up or a large enterprise, the cloud can help your business.
