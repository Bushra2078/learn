Every business has to decide how they want to store their data and execute their logic. Depending on your business requirements, cloud computing may or may not be right for you.

Here, you will learn some of the top benefits of cloud computing.

### Cloud computing is cost effective

Cloud computing provides a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Rather than paying for a pre-defined amount of computing resources or hardware up-front, you rent hardware and pay for the resources that you use.

For example, imagine you had a blog and when you made a new post you wanted to notify your subscribers via text message. Using the correct cloud computing service, you'll only be spending money when you're sending a text message to your subscribers. During the time where you're not making new posts, it wonâ€™t cost you anything.

### Cloud computing is scalable

Cloud computing supports both vertical and horizontal scaling depending on your needs.

**Vertical scaling** is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are adding a faster CPU or adding more memory.

**Horizontal scaling** is the process of adding more servers that will function together as one unit. For example, instead of having one server processing incoming requests, you have two.

### Cloud computing is elastic

As your workload changes due to a spike or drop in demand, a cloud computing system can automatically add or remove resources to compensate.

For example, imagine your website was featured in a news article, which led to a spike in traffic overnight. Since the cloud is elastic, it can automatically allocate more computing resources to handle the increased traffic. When then traffic begins to settle and the cloud notices it has too many resources allocated, it will begin to remove them so that you're not wasting money.

### Cloud computing is current

As a developer using the cloud you get to focus on what matters, writing code. You don't have to get caught up in the maintenance work of software patching, hardware set-up and upgrading, and other IT management tasks. All of this is hidden and automatically done for you to ensure you're using the latest and greatest to run your business.

### Cloud computing is reliable

When you're running a business, you want to be assured that your data is always going to be there. Cloud computing providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services to make sure your data is safe.

## Summary

Cloud computing tries to make running a business easier. Cloud computing is cost effective, scalable, elastic, current, and reliable. All these things allow you to spend more time on what matters and less time on managing the underlying details.
