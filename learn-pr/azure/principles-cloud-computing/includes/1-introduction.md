When you turn on a light, you're only concern is whether or not the light went on. You know that behind the scenes you need electricity, but the details of how the electricity got to you isn't important. You don’t think about how electricity is created in a power plant and travels a large network of high-voltage transmission lines. Once the electricity gets to your town, it's transferred to a local substation, which will lower the voltage so that it can be used in your home. Finally, the electricity travels the poles and wires that you see every day to get to your house and turn on your light.

The process of turning on a light is hidden behind the simple act of flipping a switch. At this point, electricity becomes a utility, which has many benefits. First, you only pay for what you need. When you buy a lightbulb, you don’t pay your electricity provider upfront for how long you could possibly use it. Instead, you pay the amount that you actually use. Second, you don’t have to worry about how power plants upgrade to the latest technology. Finally, you don’t have to manage scaling the electricity. For example, as people move to your town, you can rest assured that your light will stay on.

As a software developer, it would be nice to have these benefits when developing applications. Storing data, streaming video, or even hosting a website all require managing hardware and software. This management is an unnecessary obstacle when delivering your application to your users. Luckily there is a solution to this problem and it’s called cloud computing.
