Once you make the decision that cloud computing is right for you, you then need to decide how you want to deploy its services. For example, imagine you own a law firm and you're concerned with storing your data with a third-party vendor because of security reasons. Luckily, cloud computing is flexible and gives you options on how to deploy it.

Here, you'll explore the different types of deployment methods for your cloud computing resources. 

## Public cloud

In cloud computing, the most common deployment model is the public cloud. The public cloud is owned and operated by a third-party cloud provider and you are renting the hardware, storage, and network devices. One of the key characteristics of a public cloud is that you're sharing computing resources with other cloud users.

### Advantages of public clouds
- High scalability
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Rented hardware

### Disadvantages of public clouds
- Higher security threat
- Shared hardware

## Private cloud

A private cloud is like a public cloud with one major difference. A private cloud contains services and infrastructure that are located on a private network and are not being shared. The infrastructure for a private cloud can be located and managed internally or through a third party.

### Advantages of private clouds
- Increased security
- Non-shared hardware

### Disadvantages of private clouds
- Up-front costs
- Upgrading and maintenance expenses
- Requires IT expertise

## Hybrid cloud

A hybrid cloud is a mixture of both public and private clouds with the purpose of receiving the benefits of both. For example, with a hybrid cloud you could move high traffic, low-security services into the public cloud and you could move critical, sensitive services into the private cloud. 

### Advantages of hybrid clouds
- Flexibility 

### Disadvantages of hybrid clouds
- Often more expensive than public or private clouds

## Summary

Cloud computing is flexible and gives you the ability to choose how you want to deploy it. Normally, this depends on your needs of cost, security, scalability, and maintenance.
