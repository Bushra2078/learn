  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "When is best to use the perception brain design pattern?"
    choices:
    - content: "When we need to classify images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Classification is a task for Machine Learning. If we need only classification, we don’t need an Autonomous AI brain design pattern."
    - content: "When there is an expert operator who currently decides on control strategies based on advance perception."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The perception brain design pattern will automate human-like decision making based on advance perception, like vision or sound."
    - content: "When we need to predict product demand."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Prediction is a task for Machine Learning. If we only need prediction, we do not need an Autonomous AI brain design pattern."
    - content: "When we need to identify sounds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Classification of sounds is a task for Machine Learning. If we need only classification, we don’t need an Autonomous AI brain design pattern."
  - content: "When is best to use the functional brain design pattern?"
    choices:
    - content: "When there are different tasks that can only be controlled by one expert operator at a time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When there are different tasks that can only be controlled by an expert operator at a time is a hint that you need a strategy brain design decomposition."
    - content: "When there are different tasks that are executed using the same control actions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When the tasks are executed using the same control actions, it is best to use the strategy decomposition."
    - content: "When there are different tasks that are executed using independent control actions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When we can divide the problem into tasks that are executed by different expert operators over independent control actions (different nobs in the process), the functional decomposition is the best choice."
    - content: "When there is an expert operator currently performing the task."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That means that the expert operator is doing advance perception and decision making that cannot be performed by any current control method. It is a hint that Autonomous AI might outperform current methods but is not an indication that the best brain design decomposition is functional."
  - content: "When is best to use the strategy brain design pattern?"
    choices:
    - content: "When we identify strategies that are controlled using independent control actions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When the strategies control independent control actions, it is best to use the functional decomposition."
    - content: "When there are different tasks that are controlled by different expert operators independently."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When you can divide the work by operators to control a system, it is a hint that you can use a functional brain design decomposition."
    - content: "When there is an expert operator currently performing the task."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That means that the expert operator is doing advance perception and decision making that cannot be performed by any current control method. It is a hint that Autonomous AI might outperform current methods but is not an indication that the best brain design decomposition is strategy."
    - content: "When we identify strategies that are controlled using the same control actions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "We identify strategies using the three-column exercise, and each strategy requires to control all control actions in different ways depending on the scenario."
