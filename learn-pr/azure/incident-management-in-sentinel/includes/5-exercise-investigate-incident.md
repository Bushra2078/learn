## Exercise tasks

- Use built-in rules.
- Create an alert.
- Investigate an incident

<!-- Jason: When will we be looking at this do you think? Some things I'll be looking at: set-up section after intro section; and this: "Modules that include BYOS exercises should have a Note alert in the introduction unit that lets the learner know the estimated costs for resources they will need in the exercise(s) units. Please make sure “en-us” is removed from the Pricing Calculator link." Leaving these bits here if useful for you. Please delete. -->
