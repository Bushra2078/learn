<!-- Jason: Intro should go
1. Topic Sentence
2. Scenario (general boilerplate then to module specific)
3. Prose table of contents
4. Learning Objective

I'll give you an idea of how you could do it, but you'll know the accurate tech language much better than me. I'm writing this before I've even read the module so it is just to give you an idea of the format.

Azure Sentinel gives users the ability to identify anomalies in resources and manage incidents. (Topic sentence)

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a New York branch office. The company uses Azure Security Center with Azure Defender as threat protection for resources that run on Azure and on-premises. The company also monitors and protects other non-Microsoft assets. You are the lead system engineer for Contoso. (General scenario)

Recently, you've been asked to investigate and identify sign in anomalies for the company's Azure AD resources. You learn that Azure sentinel is a program that can assist you. (Specific scenario)

In this module, you will investigate Azure Sentinel incident management before learning about AS events and entities. At the end, you will discover ways to resolve incidents. (Prose table of contents)

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Azure Sentinel to protect Contoso's resouces. (learning objective)--> 

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a New York branch office. Contoso uses Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Azure AD Identity Protection, Cloud App Security, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Intune Endpoint Protection, and Microsoft Azure Information Protection. Contoso uses Azure Security Center with Azure Defender as threat protection for resources that run on Azure and on-premises. The company also monitors and protects other non-Microsoft assets. As part of the Contoso security team, you've recently been asked to investigate and identify sign in anomalies for the company's Azure AD resources.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand Azure Sentinel incident management
- Understand Azure Sentinel events and entities
- Investigate and manage incident resolution

<!-- Jason: From the design document: 
"Understand Azure Sentinel incident management
Explore Azure Sentinel evidence and entity management
Investigate and manage incident resolution" 
These are supposed to match. Which do you want to change? Is it possible to change understand to something more active at this point? Describe, use, explain...--> 

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations in an organization
- Basic experience with Azure services
- Basic knowledge of operational concepts, such as monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Basic knowledge of Azure Sentinel rules

<!-- Jason: I'm told to check that any necessary software is included in the intro. This is the first time I've been told this. Please delete this note because it is probably irrelevant but maybe it is your first time hearing this update as well. --> 

<!-- Jason: Need a media folder. I still need to check the images in high and low contrast since I can't see them here on GitHub and will do when you update the media folder. In general, I wonder if you don't see a good spot for a table (I made at least one suggestion) in this module. -->
