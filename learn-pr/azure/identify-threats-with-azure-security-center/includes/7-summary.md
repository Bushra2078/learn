Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers built-in security management and threat protection for your cloud workloads. Defender for Cloud helps you find and fix vulnerabilities, aids in blocking malicious access, and alerts you when your resources are under attack. Microsoft Defender for Cloud addresses the three most urgent security challenges:

- **Rapidly changing workloads** – It’s both a strength and a challenge of the cloud. On the one hand, users are empowered to do more. On the other, how do you make sure that the ever-changing services people are using and creating are up to your security standards and follow security best practices?

- **Increasingly sophisticated attacks** - Wherever you run your workloads, the attacks keep getting more sophisticated. You have to secure your public cloud workloads, which are, in effect, an internet-facing workload that can leave you even more vulnerable if you don't follow security best practices.

- **Security skills are in short supply** - The number of security alerts and alerting systems far outnumbers the number of administrators with the necessary background and experience to make sure your environments are protected. Staying up-to-date with the latest attacks is a constant challenge, making it impossible to stay in place while the world of security is an ever-changing front.

To help you protect yourself against these challenges, Defender for Cloud provides you with the tools to:

- **Strengthen your security posture**: Defender for Cloud assesses your environment and enables you to understand the status of your resources, and whether they're secure.

- **Protect against threats**: Defender for Cloud assesses your workloads and raises threat prevention recommendations and threat detection alerts.

- **Get secure faster**: In Defender for Cloud, everything is done in cloud speed. Because it's natively integrated, deployment of Defender for Cloud is easy, providing you with auto-provisioning and protection with Azure services.

Defender for Cloud is available to every Azure subscription through a free, basic tier. You can activate a paid tier to get more features, including integration with on-premise resources and other cloud providers.
