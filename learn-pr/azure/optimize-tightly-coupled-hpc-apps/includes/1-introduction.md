Suppose you're a member of a car manufacturing R&D team that is tasked with designing and developing their new flagship sports car. This project will require running several tightly coupled High Performance Computing (HPC) applications, each having different performance characteristics. Management would like your team to complete this project in a timely and cost-effective manner, so your job is to determine the most efficient and economical way of building and running your tightly coupled HPC applications in Azure.

In this module, you'll learn some key optimization principles that will guide you through the decision matrix to ensure that your HPC application runs efficiently from both a VM and HPC software perspective.

## Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Choose the best, cost-performant HPC SKU for each type of tightly coupled HPC application.
- Optimally build and run each type of tightly coupled HPC application on Azure HPC SKUs.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of High Performance Computing (HPC).
- Familiarity with Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) tasks such as deploying VMs and mounting shared filesystems.
- You need the Azure CLI to complete the exercise in this module. If you don't have the Azure CLI installed, see [Control Azure services with the CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/control-azure-services-with-cli/).
