<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly summarize the key skill this unit will teach

    Heading: none

    Example: "Organizations often have multiple storage accounts to let them implement different sets of requirements."

To help move your app through the development, test, and production lifecycle, you'll need a Microsoft Entra test environment. You can use your Microsoft Entra test environment during the early stages of app development and long-term as a permanent test environment.

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that will be solved by the content in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "In the shoe-company scenario, we will use a Twitter trigger to launch our app when tweets containing our product name are available."
-->
Testing your application in your production Microsoft Entra tenant would be simpler and easier, but can you safely constrain the test application in the production environment?  Will the administrators approve the creation of test users and test data in the production environment?  How can your integration tests use automated sign-ins when user interaction is required (through multi-factor authentication)?

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what's covered in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will learn the policy factors that are controlled by a storage account so you can decide how many accounts you need."
-->
This exercise takes you through the process of evaluating whether you need a dedicated tenant for your application's Microsoft Entra test environment or if you can use your existing production tenant.

<!-- 4. Visual element (highly recommended) ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Visual element, like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote. Ideally, you'll provide an image that illustrates the customer problem the unit will solve; it can use the scenario to do this or stay generic (i.e. not address the scenario).

    Heading: none
-->
<!-- TODO: add a visual element -->

<!-- 5. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to perform this sub-task.

    Structure: Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. 1-3 paragraphs of text
        3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote.

## Dedicated test tenant or production Microsoft Entra tenant?

Your task is to decide between using a Microsoft Entra tenant dedicated to testing or your production tenant as your test environment.

Using a production tenant can make some aspects of application testing easier, but it requires the right level of isolation between test and production resources. Isolation is especially important for high-privilege scenarios.

Don't use your production Microsoft Entra tenant for testing if:

- Your application uses settings that require tenant-wide uniqueness. For example, your app might need to access tenant resources as itself, not on behalf of a user, by using app-only permissions. App-only access requires admin consent, which applies to the entire tenant. Such permissions are hard to scope down safely within a tenant boundary.
- You have low tolerance of risk for potential unauthorized access of test resources by tenant members.
- Configuration changes could negatively impact the critical operation of your production environment.
- You're unable to create users or other test data in your production tenant.
- Policies are enabled in your production tenant that require user interaction during authentication. For example, if multi-factor authentication is required for all users, you can't use automated sign-ins for integration testing.
- Adding non-production resources and/or workload to your production tenant would exceed service or throttling limits for the tenant.

If any of these restrictions apply, set up a test environment in a separate tenant.

If none of these restrictions apply, you can set up a test environment in your production tenant. Be aware that global administrators in your production tenant can access its resources and change its configuration at any time. To prevent access to any test resources or configuration, put that data in a separate tenant.

After consulting with key stakeholders and reviewing the web app requirements, your team decides to use a dedicated test tenant for testing the sales team dashboard.
