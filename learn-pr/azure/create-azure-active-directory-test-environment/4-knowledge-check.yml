quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose a development team hosts a web application on Azure that signs in users and provides users access to personal medical information.  The team needs to test new web app functionality on real customer data.  The production tenant does not have any policies (for example multi-factor authentication) enabled that require user interaction during authentication.  Which of the following is a good reason for creating a separate test tenant in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) instead of using their production tenant?"
    choices:
    - content: "By testing on real customer data, there's low tolerance of risk for potential unauthorized access of test resources by tenant members."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If there's a possibility that non-test users in the tenant can access sensitive test data, they should create a separate test tenant."
    - content: "They can create a tenant for free through the Microsoft 365 Developer Program and can have test user accounts and sample data packs automatically added to the tenant."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. It's true that the team can easily get a free test tenant, test accounts, and sample data through the Microsoft 365 Developer Program. However, determining the proper level of isolation between test and production resources is much more important than ease of use when creating a test environment."
    - content: "There are no policies (for example multi-factor authentication) enabled in their production tenant that require user interaction during authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Not having policies that require user interaction during authentication would be a reason for using the production tenant for testing.  Other factors should be considered to make sure they have the right level of isolation between test and production resources before using a production tenant for testing."
  - content: "When creating a separate test tenant in Azure AD, what is a good reason for joining the Microsoft 365 Developer Program instead of manually creating a tenant?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft 365 Developer Program is free and they can have test user accounts and sample data packs automatically added to the tenant."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Microsoft 365 Developer Program provides many benefits that make it easier and faster to set up a test environment."
    - content: "They can only get a free trial of Azure AD Premium1 or Premium 2 licenses through the Microsoft 365 Developer Program."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. They can also get a free trial of Azure AD Premium1 or Premium 2 licenses when they manually create a tenant."
    - content: "The Microsoft 365 Developer Program doesn't include a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription, which can be used to create their own sandbox and develop solutions independent of their production environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The Microsoft 365 Developer Program does include a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription as well as many other benefits that make it easier and faster to set up a test environment."
  - content: "When running the `az ad user create` Azure CLI command to create a user, the following error is returned: 'Insufficient privileges to complete the operation.' What might be the cause?"
    choices:
    - content: "The *password* property is empty or isn't formatted correctly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. If the *password* property value was mis-formatted, the 'The specified password does not comply with password complexity requirements. Please provide a different password.' error would be returned."
    - content: "The *user-principal-name* property value is empty or isn't formatted properly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. If the *user-principal-name* property value was mis-formatted, the 'Property userPrincipalName is invalid.' error would be returned."
    - content: "The account running the AZ CLI script does have Global Administrator or User Administrator role."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To create a new user, the account running the AZ CLI script must have Global Administrator or User Administrator role."
