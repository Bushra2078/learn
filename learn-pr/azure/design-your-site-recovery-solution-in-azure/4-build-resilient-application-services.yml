  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: As illustrated in the previous diagram, you're running your infrastructure partially in the cloud and partially on-premises. How could you enable real-time switching of traffic if there are future power issues?
    choices:
    - content: Use Azure Traffic Manager to probe the health of the endpoints.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure Traffic Manager can automatically redirect all traffic to a health endpoint.
    - content: Use Azure Backup to probe the health of the endpoints.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Backup isn't used to monitor endpoints. It's used to back up workloads into Azure.
    - content: Use Azure Monitor in order to probe the health of the endpoints.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Monitor can't automatically redirect traffic for you.
  - content: Your company is launching in a new region, how can you ensure there aren't performance issues for the new region?
    choices:
    - content: Set up monitoring, notifications, and autoscaling.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You should monitor your region, and configure notifications for alerts and set up autoscaling to respond to demand. 
    - content: Set up monitoring, and increase your recovery time objectives.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You should be decreasing your recovery time objective as it is how long it takes for your region to be up and running again. In addition, you aren't addressing performance issues by just setting up monitoring. You must respond to performance issues by scaling or other means.
    - content: Set up notifications, then fail over and fail back for your applications.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Failing over and back again is for when a failure occurs. If your workloads aren't performing well, this solution wouldn't necessarily address the performance issues because you're replicating the same environment in another location.
  - content: Which of the following resources can be restored from backups?
    choices:
    - content: Network security groups, virtual machines, Traffic Manager.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Backup backs up virtual machines, but not network security groups or Traffic Manager.
    - content: Virtual machines, databases, disks.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: With Azure Backup and SQL server backup, you can back up all of these resources and restore them. You're able to run your workloads again as long as you have these resources backed up.
    - content: Load balancers, subnets, VPN Gateway.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Backup doesn't back up these resources.
