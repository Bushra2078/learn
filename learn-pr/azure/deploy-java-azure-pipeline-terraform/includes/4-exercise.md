In this exercise, you'll configure GitHub actions to provision your Terraform resources.

## Fork the sample application

In this module, we'll be checking out an existing project that contains all the code for our Terraform provisioning.

Fork the following GitHub repository:

```html
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-java-petclinic-simplified
```

## Workflow

Inside the project directory, you'll see a directory called `terraform` and a file called `main.tf` in it.

Lets look at some sections that define your module's configuration:

- Provider: A Terraform configuration file starts off with the specification of the provider. When using Azure, you'll specify the Azure provider (azurerm) in the provider block
- Terraform: Terraform version
- Data: Get data from already existing services
- Locals: Generates new variables using functions and expressions
- Resource: Describes resources & dependencies
- Module: Reusability & complexity abstraction

Lets look at which sections we need in our **main.tf** file:
(The comments in green highlight the different sections and their roles in our module)

```yml
provider "azurerm" {
  version = "=2.20.0"
  features {}
}

# This creates a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = var.resource_group
  location = var.location

  tags = {
    "Terraform" = "true"
  }
}

resource "random_password" "password" {
  length = 32
  special = true
  override_special = "_%@"
}

# This creates a MySQL server
resource "azurerm_mysql_server" "main" {
  name                              = "${azurerm_resource_group.main.name}-mysql-server"
  location                          = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name               = azurerm_resource_group.main.name

  administrator_login               = "petclinic"
  administrator_login_password      = random_password.password.result

  geo_redundant_backup_enabled      = false
  infrastructure_encryption_enabled = false
  public_network_access_enabled     = true
  ssl_enforcement_enabled           = true
  ssl_minimal_tls_version_enforced  = "TLS1_2"
}

# This is the database that our application will use
resource "azurerm_mysql_database" "main" {
  name                = "${azurerm_resource_group.main.name}_mysql_db"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  server_name         = azurerm_mysql_server.main.name
  charset             = "utf8"
  collation           = "utf8_unicode_ci"
}

# This rule is to enable the 'Allow access to Azure services' checkbox
resource "azurerm_mysql_firewall_rule" "main" {
  name                = "${azurerm_resource_group.main.name}-mysql-firewall"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  server_name         = azurerm_mysql_server.main.name
  start_ip_address    = "0.0.0.0"
  end_ip_address      = "0.0.0.0"
}

# This creates the plan that the service use
resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "main" {
  name                = "${var.application_name}-plan"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  kind                = "Linux"
  reserved            = true

  sku {
    tier = "PremiumV2"
    size = "P1v2"
  }
}

# This creates the service definition
resource "azurerm_app_service" "main" {
  name                = var.application_name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  app_service_plan_id = azurerm_app_service_plan.main.id
  https_only          = true

  site_config {
    always_on        = true
    linux_fx_version = "JAVA|8-jre8"
  }

  # Application specific environment variables
  app_settings = {
    "WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE" = "false"

    "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE"     = "mysql"
    "SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL"      = "jdbc:mysql://${azurerm_mysql_server.main.fqdn}:3306/${azurerm_mysql_database.main.name}?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&useSSL=true&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=UTC"
    "SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME" = "${azurerm_mysql_server.main.administrator_login}@${azurerm_mysql_server.main.name}"
    "SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD" = azurerm_mysql_server.main.administrator_login_password
  }
}
```

## Customize the workflow

In your forked repository you need to customize your application, and resource group name.
Using the built-in GitHub Text editor or your editor of choice, edit and commit `terraform/variables.tf` and change **CHANGE_ME_RESOURCE_GROUP** to your intended resource group name and **CHANGE_ME_APP_NAME** to your intended application name:

```yaml
variable "resource_group" {
  description = "The resource group"
  default = "CHANGE_ME_RESOURCE_GROUP"
}

variable "application_name" {
  description = "The Spring Boot application name"
  default     = "CHANGE_ME_APP_NAME"
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure location where all resources in this example should be created"
  default     = "westeurope"
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the name of your application name is unique.

## Set Up up your workflow

You now need to allow access from your GitHub workflow to your Azure account.
Create a service principal with the Azure CLI:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you assign the name of your resource group to the variable `AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP` or substitute the value for it in the commands below.
> Replace `yourServicePrincipalName` with a name of your service principal you choose.

```azurecli
RESOURCE_ID=$(az group show --name "$AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP" --query id -o tsv)
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "yourServicePrincipalName" --role contributor --scopes "$RESOURCE_ID" --sdk-auth
```

This command will return JSON - copy it and keep it safe as we'll use it in the next step:

```bash
{
  "clientId": "XXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "clientSecret": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "subscriptionId": "XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "tenantId": "XXXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX",
  ...
}
```

## GitHub Secrets

Once you have the required ID and Secrets, the next step is to add them the secret store in your GitHub project.

GitHub repositories have a feature known as Secrets that allow you to store sensitive information related to a project. For this exercise, store three secrets â€“ `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`.
You'll create these secrets because they'll be used by Terraform to authenticate to Azure.

To create the secrets, navigate to your forked GitHub repository, select the `Settings` menu and then on `Secrets`.
Create a GitHub secret for each of four secrets using the values returned the Azure service principal.

The result will be something like this:

![Github Secrets.](../media/4-secrets.png)

## Workflow file

Inside the project directory, you'll see a directory called `.github/workflows` and a file called `main.yml` in it.
This file is a GitHub workflow and will use the secret we configured above to deploy the application to your Azure subscription.

In that file, you'll see the following content:

```yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      ARM_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
      ARM_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}}
      ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
      ARM_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}

    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./terraform
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan

      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This workflow does the following actions:

- Check whether the configuration is formatted properly
- generate a plan for every pull requests
- apply the configuration when you update the GitHub branch

Your workflow will be triggered whenever code is pushed to the repository.

## Test the GitHub Action

You can now manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow by going to "Actions", then select the terraform workflow.
Then, select the "Terraform" workflow. Notice how the "Terraform Init", "Terraform Plan" and "Terraform Validate" steps have been triggered.

Expand the "Terraform Apply" step. Terraform has created the resources and displayed the Azure Instance URL.
Verify your Azure App Instance is publicly available.

## Next Steps

In the next exercise, you'll use GitHub Actions to deploy a Spring Boot sample application.
