In this exercise, you'll configure an automation workflow to provision your Terraform resources.

## Access the sample application

In this exercise, you'll create a GitHub repository from a template that contains all the code for Terraform provisioning.

1. On GitHub, go to the main page of the repository:

   ```html
   https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-java-petclinic-simplified
   ```

1. Above the file list, select **Use this template**.

    ![Screenshot of the "Use this template" button on the mslearn-java-petclinic-simplified main page.](../media/4-template.png)

1. In the **Repository name** box, enter a unique name for your repository. Be sure to follow the naming convention for GitHub repositories.

1. Ensure that the **Private** option is selected, and then select **Create repository from template**.

    ![Screenshot of the "Create repository from template" button on the "Create a new repository from ..." page.](../media/4-template-create.png)

## Workflow

Inside the project directory for the repository you've just created, you'll see a directory called *terraform* and, within it, a file called *main.tf*.

Let's look at a few sections that you might use to define your module's configuration:

- **Provider**: A Terraform configuration file starts with the specification of the provider. When you use Azure, you specify the Azure provider (azurerm) in the provider block.
- **Terraform**: The Terraform version that you're working with.
- **Data**: Gets data from existing services.
- **Locals**: Generates new variables by using functions and expressions.
- **Resource**: Describes resources and dependencies.
- **Module**: Reusability and complexity abstraction.

To provision our application and database, we'll only need to include the **Provider** and **Resource** sections.

Next, open the *main.tf* file, and review the outline and comments:

```yml
provider "azurerm" {
  version = "=2.20.0"
  features {}
}

# Creates a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {

## Set up your GitHub Actions workflow

Let's provide your GitHub workflow access to your Azure account.

In the Azure CLI, create a service principal by running the following command:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace *\<yourServicePrincipalName>* with the service principal name you want to use.

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<yourServicePrincipalName>" --role contributor --sdk-auth
```

The preceding command returns the following JSON. Copy it for use in the next step:

```bash
{
  "clientId": "XXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "clientSecret": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "subscriptionId": "XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "tenantId": "XXXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX",
  ...
}
```

## GitHub secrets

Your GitHub repository has a feature called Secrets, where you can store sensitive information that's used by Terraform to authenticate to Azure.

After you've created the required IDs and the secret in the preceding step, the next step in this unit is to add them to the Secrets store in your GitHub project.

For this exercise, you need to store the following secrets:
* `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
* `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
* `AZURE_TENANT_ID`

To store the secrets, go to your forked GitHub repository, select **Settings**, and then select **Secrets** on the left pane.
Create a GitHub secret for each of four secrets using the values returned the Azure service principal.

Be sure to store the secrets without the quotation marks (" "), as shown in the following screenshot:

![Screenshot showing stored secrets on the Secrets pane under GitHub Settings.](../media/4-secrets.png)

## Workflow file

Inside your project directory is a directory called *.github/workflows* and, within it, a file called *main.yml*.

The *main.yml* file is a GitHub workflow. It uses the secret you've just configured to deploy your application to your Azure subscription.

In the *main.yml* workflow file is the following content:

```yml
name: TERRAFORM

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
    - 'terraform/**'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
    - 'terraform/**'

  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      ARM_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
      ARM_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}}
      ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
      ARM_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}

    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./terraform
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan

      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This workflow performs the following actions:

- It checks whether the configuration is formatted properly.
- It generates a plan for every pull request.
- It triggers the configuration when you update files in the *terraform* directory.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also trigger the GitHub Actions workflow by going to **Actions**, selecting the Terraform workflow, and selecting **Re-run existing Jobs**.

## Trigger the workflow

Next, in your repository, trigger your GitHub action by doing the following:

1. In the built-in GitHub text editor, or in an editor of your choice, edit *terraform/variables.tf* as follows:

   a. Change `"<CHANGE_ME_RESOURCE_GROUP>"` to your intended resource group name.  
   b. Change `"<CHANGE_ME_APP_NAME>"` to your intended application name. Make sure that your application name is unique.

    ```yaml
    variable "resource_group" {
      description = "The resource group"
      default = "<CHANGE_ME_RESOURCE_GROUP>"
    }

    variable "application_name" {
      description = "The Spring Boot application name"
      default     = "CHANGE_ME_APP_NAME"
    }

    variable "location" {
      description = "The Azure location where all resources in this example should be created"
      default     = "westeurope"
    }
    ```

1. Commit your changes.

## Verify the GitHub Actions build

1. In your repository, select **Actions**, and then select the **TERRAFORM** workflow on the left pane.

1. In the list of steps, verify that **Terraform Init**, **Terraform Plan**, and **Terraform Validate** have been triggered.

    ![Screenshot displaying the results of the Terraform workflow run.](../media/4-terraform-run.png)

1. In the list of steps, expand **Terraform Apply**, and verify that:
  
    * Terraform has created the resources and displays the Azure instance URL.
    * Your Azure app instance is publicly available.

    ![Screenshot showing that the Azure app instance is publicly available.](../media/4-template-url.png)

## Next steps

In the next exercise, you'll use GitHub Actions to deploy a sample Spring Boot application.

## Set up your Azure Pipelines workflow

1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Service connections** page from the project settings page

1. Choose **+ New service connection** and select **Azure Resource Manager**.

1. Specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   | --------- | ----------- |
   | Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this service connection in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure subscription. |
   | Scope level | Select Azure Subscription. |
   | Subscription | select an existing Azure subscription. |
   | Resource Group | Leave empty to allow users to access all resources defined within the subscription |

> To refresh a service connection, edit the connection and select **Verify**. Once you save, the service connection will be valid for two years.  

## Workflow file

Inside your project directory is a directory called *azuredevops* and, within it, a file called *provision.yml*.

The *provision.yml* file is a Pipeline workflow. It uses the Service Connection you've just configured to deploy your application to your Azure subscription.

In the *provision.yml* workflow file is the following content:

```yml
name: Provision Resources

trigger: none

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:

- task: TerraformTaskV1@0
  inputs:
    provider: 'azurerm'
    command: 'init'
    workingDirectory: $(Build.Repository.LocalPath)/terraform
    backendServiceArm: $(serviceConnection)
    backendAzureRmResourceGroupName: $(serviceConnection)
    backendAzureRmStorageAccountName: $(serviceConnection)
    backendAzureRmContainerName: 'tfstate'
    backendAzureRmKey: 'tf/terraform.tfstate'

- task: TerraformTaskV1@0
  inputs:
    provider: 'azurerm'
    command: 'apply'
    workingDirectory: $(Build.Repository.LocalPath)/terraform
    backendServiceArm: $(serviceConnection)
    backendAzureRmResourceGroupName: $(serviceConnection)
    backendAzureRmStorageAccountName: $(serviceConnection)
    backendAzureRmContainerName: 'tfstate'
    backendAzureRmKey: 'tf/terraform.tfstate'
    environmentServiceNameAzureRM: $(serviceConnection)
```

## Next steps

In the next exercise, you'll use Azure Pipelines to deploy a sample Spring Boot application.
