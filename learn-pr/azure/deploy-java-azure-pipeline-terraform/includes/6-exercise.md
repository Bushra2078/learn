In this unit, you'll configure GitHub actions to provision your Terraform resources.

You'll configure your pipeline to act as soon as you push code to master (see on: push: branches: master), then you'll check out the code (actions/checkout@master), then do a terraform format, terraform init, terraform validate, terraform plan, terraform apply

## Set Up up your workflow

You now need to allow access from your GitHub workflow to your Azure account. Open up a terminal and type the following command, replacing `yourServicePrincipalName` with the name of your service principal.

Create a service principal to deploy to Azure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you assign the name of your resource group to the variable `AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP` or substitute the value for it in the commands below.

```bash
RESOURCE_ID=$(az group show --name "$AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP" --query id -o tsv)
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "yourServicePrincipalName" --role contributor --scopes "$RESOURCE_ID" --sdk-auth
```

This command will return JSON - copy it and keep it safe as we'll use it in the next step:

```bash
{
  "clientId": "XXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "clientSecret": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "subscriptionId": "XXXXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "tenantId": "XXXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX",
  ...
}
```

You'll then need to go to Certificates & secrets section of your app registration and create a new client secret. Take note of this value also.

## GitHub Secrets

Once you have the required ID and Secrets, the next step is to add them the secret store in your GitHub project.

Next youâ€™ll create secrets to avoid exposing your service principal.
In GitHub, we can specify them once we go to Settings -> Secrets.

We'll need to create the secrets, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`.
Add the values to each variable from the ones you're copied when creating your service principal.
The result will be something like this:

## Workflow file

Inside the project directory, you'll see a directory called `.github/workflows` and a file called `main.yml` in it. This file is a GitHub workflow and will use the secret we configured above to deploy the application to your Azure subscription.

In that file, you'll see the following content:

```yaml

This workflow does the following actions:

- <!--todo add description >

Your workflow will be triggered whenever code is pushed to the repository.
There are many other [events that trigger GitHub actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). You could, for example, deploy each time a new tag is created on the project.

## Test the GitHub Action

You can now commit and push the `main.yml` file we created.

Going to the `Actions` tab of your  GitHub project, you should see that your project is automatically built and deployed:

Congratulations! Each time you `git push` your code, your TerraForm provisioned resources are now automatically deployed to production.
