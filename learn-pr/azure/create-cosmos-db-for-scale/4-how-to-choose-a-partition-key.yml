      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can't change the partition key after you create a container.
    - content: You can set the partition key on a container only when you create the container.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You can set the partition key only when the container is created.
    - content: You can programmatically change a partition key on a container at any time if you have the correct permissions.

  - content: Your organization plans to use Azure Cosmos DB to store vehicle telemetry data generated from millions of vehicles every second. Which of the following options for your partition key will optimize storage distribution?
    choices:
    - content: Vehicle model
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Most auto manufacturers have only a couple dozen models. This option is potentially the least granular, will create a fixed number of logical partitions, and it might not distribute data evenly across all physical partitions.
    - content: Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Auto manufacturer transactions occur throughout the year. Using VINs creates a more balanced distribution of storage across partition key values.
    - content: Vehicle color.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Some vehicle colors are more popular among car buyers. Using automobile color for the partition key won't distribute data evenly across all physical partitions because ownership is heavily weight among a few popular colors.
