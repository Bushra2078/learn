  - content: 'Your organization is planning to use Azure Cosmos DB to store vehicle telemetry data generated from millions of vehicles every second. Which of the following options for your Partition Key will optimize storage distribution?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Vehicle Model'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Most auto manufactures only have a couple dozen models. This option is potentially the least granular, will create a fixed number of logical partitions, and may not distribute data evenly across all physical partitions.
    - content: 'Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) which looks like WDDEJ9EB6DA032037'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Auto manufacturers have transactions occurring throughout the year. This option will create a more balanced distribution of storage across partition key values.
