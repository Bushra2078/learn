You now understand how request units are used to determine database throughput. You also know how to use partition keys to create a scale-out strategy for your database.

Now you're ready to create your database and container. You can use the Azure portal to create an Azure Cosmos DB database, or you can create an Azure Cosmos DB database programmatically.

In this exercise, you'll use the Azure portal to create an Azure Cosmos DB database named **"Products"** with a container named **"Clothing"**, and set your partition key and throughput values.

However, if you would rather create an Azure Cosmos DB database and container programmatically, you can use the next exercise.

## Creating your database and container

1. You should already be signed into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). Ths exercise will be using the Cosmos DB account you created in a previous lesson.  

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **All services**.

1. On the **All services** menu, select **Databases** > **Azure Cosmos DB**. Select the account that you created in the previous exercise. 

    [!NOTE] If your sandbox session expired, you'll need to go back to that lesson to reactivate the sandbox and recreate your Cosmos DB.

1. In the menu for your Azure Cosmos DB account, select **Data Explorer**. 

1. On the Data Explorer toolbbar or the Data Explorer pane, select **New Container**.

1. On the**New Container** pane, enter the following settings for the new container.

    | Setting | Suggested value | Description |
    |---|---|---|
    | Database id  | Products | Select *Create new*, and then enter *Products* as the name for the new database. Database names must be 1 to 255 characters in length, and must not contain /, \\, #, ?, or a trailing space. Leave *Share throughput acrosss containers* selected. |
    | Database throughput | Autoscale is selected | Database Max RU/s set to 4000 request units per second. |
    | Container id | Clothing | Enter *Clothing* as the name for your new container. Container IDs have the same character requirements as database names. |
    | Partition key | /productId | productId is a good partition key for an online retail scenario, as so many queries are based around the product ID. |
    
1. Scroll down, accept the defaults for any remaining options, and then select **OK**. 
 
    It may take a while for the database and container to be created. The Data Explorer displays the new database **Products** and the container **Clothing**.

## Summary

In this exercise, you used the Azure portal with your knowledge of partition keys and request units to create a database and container, with throughput and scaling settings that are appropriate for your business needs.
