This module showed you how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account that you can use for real-world scenarios like an online retail app. By creating a database with a smart partition key, you can scale horizontally as your need for data storage grows. You also learned about request unit needs for your application. You learned how to plan for RUs when you create your account so that you can scale up your throughput when user demand increases.
