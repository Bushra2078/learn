Having a partition strategy ensures that when your database needs to grow, it can do so easily and retain efficient queries and transactions.

Your company's product data grows every day, as does it's user base, but you can't keep adding data to a single server, or single partition, as it will eventually run out of space. To prepare for this, you need a partitioning strategy to scale out instead of up. Scaling out is also called horizontal scaling, and it enables you to add more and more partitions to your database as your need them.

The partition and scale out strategy in Azure Cosmos DB is driven by the partition key, which is a value set when you create a collection. Once the partition key is set, it cannot be changed without recreating the collection, so selecting the right partition key is an important decision to make early in your development process.  

In this article, you will learn how to choose a parition key that's right for your scenario, and will take advantage of the autoscaling that Cosmos DB can do for you.

## Partition key basics

A partition key should represent a value in your database that's frequently queried. So in an online retail scenario, using the UserID or ProductID value as the partition key is a good choice. UserID is a good choice as your application frequently needs to retrieve the personalization settings, shopping cart, order history, and profile information for the user, just to name a few. ProductID is also a good choice as your application needs to query invetory levels, shipping costs, color options, warehouse locations and more.

A partition key should aim to distribute operations across the database. You want to distribute requests in an effort to avoid hot partitions. A hot partition would be a single partition that's receiving many more requests than the others and can create a throughput bottleneck. For example, for your e-commerce application, the current time would be a poor choice of partition key because all the incoming data would go to a single partition key. UserID or ProductID would be better as all the users on your site would likely be adding and updating their shopping cart or profile information at a about the same frequency, which distributes the reads and writes across all the user partitions. Likewise, updates to product data would also likely be fairly evenly distributed, making them a good choice.

Each partition key has a maximum storage space of 10 GB, which is the size of one physical partition in Azure Cosmos DB. So if your single UserID or ProductID record is going to be larger than 10GB, think about using a composite key instead so that each record is smaller. An example of a composite key would be UserID-date, which would look like CustomerName-08072018. This composite key approach would enable you to create a new partition for each day a user visited the site.

## Best practices

When you're trying to determine the right partition key and the solution isn't obvious, here are a few tips to keep in mind.

* Donâ€™t be afraid of having too many partition keys, the more partition keys you have, the more scalability you have.

* To determine the best partition key for a read-heavy workload, review the top three to five queries you plan on using. The value most frequently included in the WHERE clause is a good candidate for the partition key.

* For write-heavy workloads, you'll need to understand the transactional needsof your workload because the partition key is the scope of multi-document transactions.

## Summary

This module demonstrated the importance of partition keys, and how selecting the right partition key can help avoid problems down the line such as hot partitions and maxed out physical partitions. You can now use this information to create a database with a partition key that's built to handle the needs of your application.
