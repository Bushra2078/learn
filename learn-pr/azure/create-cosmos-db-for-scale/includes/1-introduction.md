## Motivation
Databases need to scale to meet both the data velocity and volume demands created by global audiences.

Suppose you work for an online retailer and your database needs to scale to accommodate a growing product catalog. You also have a growing global customer base, and your customers expect quick responses to their queries and immediate updates to product availability.

You database should scale automatically to account for new products and users, have high throughput, and low latency to keep pace with your customers expectations.

## Learning objective

- Create an NoSQL database with Azure Cosmos DB
- Set the initial throughput volume for your database using request units
- Choose a partition key
- Create a database and collection in Azure Cosmos DB
