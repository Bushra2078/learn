Databases need to scale to meet both the data velocity and volume demands created by global audiences.

You work for an online retailer, where your database needs to scale to accomodate a growing product catalog. You also have a growing global customer base, and need to provide instant responses to their queries and immediate updates to product availability.

You need to ensure your database can scale automatically to account for new products and users, and has high throughput and low latency to keep pace with your customers expectations.

In this module, you will learn not only how to create a NoSQL database with Azure Cosmos DB, but you will learn about the most important decisions to make when creating a database that's built to scale - throughput and partitioning. Throughput, which is what enables your customers to access your data quickly, is measured in Azure Cosmos DB with an entity called a request unit. And partitioning, which enables your database to scale up to store more data, is managed by partition keys. By learning about request units and partition keys in the beginning, you'll be able to make the right long term decisions when creating your own Azure Cosmos DB database.

## Prerequisites

* Have an understanding of databases and queries
* Completed the “Choose an approach to store your data in Azure” module in the “Storing data in Azure” Learning Path to understand when to use Azure Cosmos DB
