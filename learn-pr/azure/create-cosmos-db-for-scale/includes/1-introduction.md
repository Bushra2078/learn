Databases need to scale to meet the velocity and volume demands of global audiences.

You work for an online retailer, where your site needs to scale to meet a growing product catalog and provide instant results to customer input.

You need to ensure your database scales automatically to account for new products, and has high throughput and low latency to keep pace with your customers expectations.

In this module, you will learn how to create a NoSQL database built to scale with Azure Cosmos DB. By learning about partitioning early in your database creation, which enables your database to scale automatically, and throughput, which enables your customers to access your product data quickly, you'll be set for success later when you need to scale up to meet your company's growing needs.
