## Motivation
Databases need to scale to meet both the data velocity and volume demands created by global audiences.

As an example, suppose you work for an online retailer, where your database needs to scale to accommodate a growing product catalog. You also have a growing global customer base, and need to provide instant responses to their queries and immediate updates to product availability.

You need to ensure your database can scale automatically to account for new products and users, and has high throughput and low latency to keep pace with your customers expectations.

## Learning objective

- Create an NoSQL database with Azure Cosmos DB
- Set the initial throughput volume for your database using request units
- Choose a partition key
- Create a database and collection in Azure Cosmos DB

## Prerequisites

- Have an understanding of databases and queries
- Completed the “Choose an approach to store your data in Azure” module in the “Storing data in Azure” Learning Path to understand when to use Azure Cosmos DB
