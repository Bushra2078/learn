Databases need to scale to meet both the data velocity and the volume demands created by global audiences.

Suppose you work as a database admin for an online retailer. The company's database needs to scale to accommodate an expanding product catalog. The company also has a growing global customer base. Customers expect quick responses to their queries and immediate updates to product availability.

Your company's database should scale automatically to account for new products, and it should have high throughput and low latency to keep pace with your customers' expectations.

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database for high-performance applications of any size or scale. You decide that Azure Cosmos DB is the solution to your company's database requirements. Learn how to create and configure an Azure Cosmos DB account, database, and container in the Azure portal and programmatically in Azure Cloud Shell.

- Create an Azure Cosmos DB account.
- Set the initial throughput volume for your database using request units (RUs).
- Choose a partition key.
- Create a database and container in Azure Cosmos DB by using the Azure portal.
- Create a database and container programmatically by using C#, Java, or the Azure CLI.
