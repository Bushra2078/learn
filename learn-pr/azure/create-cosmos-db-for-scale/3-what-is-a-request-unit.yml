  questions:
  - content: Which of the following statements is true about the number of RUs used for a specific database operation on the same data?
    choices:
    - content:  The number of RUs varies over time.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB ensures that the number of RUs for a specific database operation over a specific dataset doesn't change.
    - content: The number of RUs is deterministic.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Azure Cosmos DB ensures that the number of RUs for a specific database operation over a specific dataset is deterministic.
    - content:  The average RU for the database operation in 30 days is the RU/s to use to plan for the next month.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. In Azure Cosmos DB, the number of RUs for a specific database operation over a specific dataset is consistent and not based on average use.

  - content: Which of the following options affects the number of RUs it takes to write a document?
    choices:
    - content: The size of the document, the database region, and the indexing policy.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB replicates data to all the regions associated with your Cosmos DB account, so a database region doesn't affect RU provisioning.
    - content: The size of the document, the item property count, and the Azure data retention policy.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB automatically, securely backs up your data, so you don't need to take data retention policy into account when you choose RUs for a database or container.
    - content: The size of the document, the item property count, and the indexing policy.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Consider the size of the document, the item property count, and the indexing policy when you provision RUs.
      
  - content: Which of the following statements is true about RUs in Azure Cosmos DB?
    choices:
    - content: The cost to read a 1-KB item is approximately 1 RU.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The cost to read a 1-KB item is approximately 1 RU.
    - content: When you set the number of RUs, you can't later change this number.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can increase or decrease the number of RUs provisioned to a container or a database.
    - content: If you provision a specific number of RUs on an Azure Cosmos container or database, you can't know whether that number of RUs are available in each region associated with your account.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB ensures that the same number of RUs are available in each region associated with your account.
