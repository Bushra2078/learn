The decision to move to the cloud and taking on a role as an Azure Developer, Solution Architect, or Administrator requires knowing the foundations for how networking works. While networks are made up of various network devices, there are other aspects to keep in mind as well. For example, how do we share resources on a network in a secure way, and how do we only allow authorized access to theses resources.

In this module, we'll explore the fundamentals of networking security. We'll look at how to share resources in a client-server network and cover the core difference between authentication and authorization. Then we'll explore how to use firewalls to protect our network and discuss how to monitor network access and traffic usage. Finally, we'll see how each aspect is addressed within Azure.
