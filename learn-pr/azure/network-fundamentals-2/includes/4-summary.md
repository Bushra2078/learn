As an Azure Developer, Solution Architect, or Administrator. Before considering a move to the cloud, it's a good idea to have a fundamental understanding of the basics of networks, their components, and building blocks.  Networks are made up of many parts including communication protocols, tangible element like network devices, switches, and routers, and more fluid parts like monitoring and network security. Understanding the basic building blocks of your network including the client-server relationship, and the hardware that makes a network possible, is an important step in understanding Azure concepts.

The hub was the first method for build small networks with a handful of computers, printers, or servers on them.  As demands grew, hubs were replaced by switches, which offered improvements in security and network traffic management.  Instead of sending network packets to every connected device, like a hub.  The switch interpreted the data and sent it to the specified machine.  The switch is the most common building block in a network.  As the volume of networks increased, it was essential networks communicated with each other. Routers were introduced to bridge networks.  Switches and routers are the fundamental components of any modern network.  As you move to the cloud, many of the functions of switch's and routers can be done in software, allowing for better overall control, monitoring, and maintenance.

Without these fundamental components, there would be no networks.  All computers would be standalone machines. Collaboration would mean saving data to an external data source and shipping it to where it was needed, or using modems to create point-to-point connections.

In this module, you've been looking at the hardware that makes a network possible. You've explore various network client and server options.  Finally, you explored the hardware at the heart of any network, hubs, switches, and routers.
