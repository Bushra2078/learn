In this module, we explored the basics of using network security to protect your network. 

Without an appropriate understanding of security, your network is vulnerable to attacks and performance issues. This vulnerability can negatively affect your organization.

We discussed how authentication and authorization are used to protect a network, and we covered how a network is monitored for intrusion, performance, and availability. We've also explored the Azure tools that can be used to help protect your network.

You should now have a better understanding of how the resources, devices, and users on your network can be protected, so that your organization is safer financially, and its reputation is also preserved.
