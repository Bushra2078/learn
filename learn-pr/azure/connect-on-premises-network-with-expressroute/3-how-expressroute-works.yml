    choices:
    - content: "It provides a direct connection from your on-premises network to an Azure datacenter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The Microsoft Peering enables you to connect your on-premises network to Office 365 services and Dynamic 365."
    - content: "It enables you to connect your on-premises network to Office 365 services and Dynamic 365."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct answer"
    - content: "It provides a connection between your on-premises network and an ExpressRoute provider."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The Microsoft Peering enables you to connect your on-premises network to Office 365 services and Dynamic 365."
    - content: "It provides a point-to-site connection for computers in your on-premises location to Office 365 services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The Microsoft Peering enables you to connect your on-premises network to Office 365 services and Dynamic 365."
  - content: "What is an ExpressRoute circuit?"
    choices:
    - content: "An ExpressRoute circuit implements a site-to-site connection across a VPN connection to an Azure datacenter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. A circuit provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge-routers."
    - content: "An ExpressRoute circuit is a direct hard-wired connection between your on-premises datacenter and an Azure datacenter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. A circuit provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge-routers."
    - content: "A backup service that provides connectivity to the Microsoft Cloud if your VPN connection fails."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. A circuit provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge-routers."
    - content: "A circuit provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge-routers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct answer."
  - content: "What security benefits does Azure ExpressRoute provide?"
    choices:
    - content: "An ExpressRoute connection is automatically encrypted, protecting traffic passing across the Internet to the Microsoft Cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. ExpressRoute uses a dedicated, private network to connect to the Microsoft Cloud. Traffic doesn't traverse the Internet, making it difficult to intercept."
    - content: "The speed at which data traverses an ExpressRoute connection makes it impossible to intercept by network monitors and packet sniffers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. ExpressRoute uses a dedicated, private network to connect to the Microsoft Cloud. Traffic doesn't traverse the Internet, making it difficult to intercept."
    - content: "ExpressRoute uses a dedicated, private network to connect to the Microsoft Cloud. Traffic doesn't traverse the public Internet, making it difficult to intercept."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct answer"
    - content: "ExpressRoute uses a proprietary transmission protocol that constantly varies, making it difficult to intercept traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. ExpressRoute uses a dedicated, private network to connect to the Microsoft Cloud. Traffic doesn't traverse the Internet, making it difficult to intercept."
