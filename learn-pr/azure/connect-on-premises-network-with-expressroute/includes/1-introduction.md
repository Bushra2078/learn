Azure ExpressRoute is a service that enables you to extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud.  Connections are made over a private high-bandwidth connection. The ExpressRoute service provides a secure and reliable way to connect your on-premises network directly to Azure.

Imagine you're the solution architect for a financial organization, who has begun migrating resources to Azure. The organization has systems that need to communicate between their on-premises network and Azure, and they don't want this traffic traversing the internet. These applications have higher bandwidth requirements and need to have consistent network performance. The organization also uses Office 365, and would like to reduce traffic over their internet pipe and send this traffic over a dedicated connection to Azure. They believe ExpressRoute meets their needs but need to understand more about the service and whether they should include it in their infrastructure.

Your goal is to identify whether the Azure ExpressRoute service is the correct service to use to allow connectivity from on-premises networks to Microsoft cloud.

In this module, you'll learn about the Azure ExpressRoute service, what it is, how it works, and how it's configured.
