## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft global network with ExpressRoute*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    A financial organization has begun migrating resources to Azure. They have systems that need to communicate between their on-premises network and Azure, and they do not want this traffic traversing the internet. They have higher bandwidth requirements and need the ability to have consistent network performance. They also use Office 365 and would like to reduce traffic over their internet pipe and send this traffic over a dedicated connection to Azure. They believe ExpressRoute meets their needs but need to understand more about the service to include it in their infrastructure.
