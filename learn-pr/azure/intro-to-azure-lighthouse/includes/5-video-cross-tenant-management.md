Azure Lighthouse will change the way that Contoso manages its Azure customers moving forward. The features and capabilities available will enable you to meet the needs of your new customer Lamna Healthcare.

Over the course of the previous units, you've gained an awareness of what Azure Lighthouse can offer Contoso. You've seen how it can streamline and provide a service offering at scale.

Next, we'll show you some of the capabilities of managing Lamna Healthcare once they've been onboarded.

In this unit, you'll see how a Contoso management user goes about managing the Lamna Healthcare subscription.

## Overview

The Azure Lighthouse service has two parts to it. The first is the service provider, looking to provide a scalable Azure-managed service. The second is the customer looking to have some aspect of the Azure subscription or resource groups administered on their behalf. Both parts have unique requirements, each with their own prerequisites and configurations. Setting up two disparate environments is beyond the scope of this module.

So, to better demonstrate the capabilities of using Azure Lighthouse with our customer Lamna Healthcare, a video presentation has been created.

This content will look at:

- How to find Lamna Healthcare, or any of your onboarded Azure subscriptions, or resource groups
- Verify the Lamna Healthcare subscription details and the role assignments associated with it
- How to view all the resources available under delegated resource management, and how to filter them to meet the view just Lamna Healthcare
- How to check the compliance of Lamna Healthcare's subscription
- How to view Lamna Healthcare's security score
- Look at how Azure Monitor can provide analytics from the managed resources data
