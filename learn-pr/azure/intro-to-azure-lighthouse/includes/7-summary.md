Managing multiple Azure subscriptions and tenants at scale can be a challenge, especially with the reluctance of many customers to hand over what they perceive to be full control of their Azure estate to a third party. You want to create and deploy new managed services quickly and with a high level of automation.

Your company was approached by a new customer that wants a managed service. They were keen to only extend the necessary access and privileges needed to carry out management, maintenance, and governance activities. This created a new challenge.

Microsoft has launched a management capability called Azure Lighthouse that introduces the concept of delegated resource management. You can use Azure Lighthouse to offer customers a managed Azure service, where they manage the level of authority and control you have over their subscription(s). Azure Lighthouse capabilities allow you to automate the management of multiple customer subscriptions and tenants.

Without Azure Lighthouse, your customers would have to grant direct access to their Azure instance, and you would need to work on each customer individually.

In this module, you've gained an awareness of Azure Lighthouse and its capabilities. You've learned how to prepare your Azure tenant for Azure delegated resource management, and seen how to create automated onboarding using Azure Resource Management templates. You've also seen how to use Azure Lighthouse features to manage your customers, and how to publish a managed service offer via the Azure Marketplace.
