This unit is an intro to the following exercises in lab 2:

1. Review an Azure Marketplace MSP offer
1. Review delegated customer resources from the MSP subscription
1. Update an offer to allow a principalID to create a managed identity

Unit structure has visibility of offers first, then Azure Marketplace, but lab has review marketplace offers THEN review delegated customer resources. Do we need to flip the unit order?
