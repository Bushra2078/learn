## Exercise scenarios

### Review Azure Marketplace offers
Here you will visit the Azure Marketplace and see the service offers published by other Microsoft Partners.

### Review your delegated customers and their Azure resource
As a Contoso user, you will use Azure Lighthouse to view your customers and the delegated access you have been granted.
Then you'll view your customer's resources using the Azure Portal and your Contoso credentials.

### Update a service offer using Azure Resource Manager templates
Finally, you'll updated and deploy a change to your service offer using PowerShell, to grant your user group permission to create new managed identities in your customer's subscription.
