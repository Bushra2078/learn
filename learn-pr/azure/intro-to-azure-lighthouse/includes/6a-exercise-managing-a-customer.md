### Review Azure Marketplace offers

Start by visiting the Azure Marketplace to see the service offers published by other Microsoft Partners.

### Review your delegated customers and their Azure resource

As a Contoso user, you can use Azure Lighthouse to view your customers, and the delegated access you have been granted. You can also view your customer's resources using the Azure portal and your Contoso credentials.

### Update a service offer using Azure Resource Manager templates

Finally, update and deploy a change to your service offer using PowerShell, to grant your user group permission to create new managed identities in your customer's subscription.

> When you've completed the deployment exercises in this lab **DO NOT CLOSE THE LAB ENVIRONMENT.** Instead, keep the lab running in a separate window, return to this course and continue with the next unit.
