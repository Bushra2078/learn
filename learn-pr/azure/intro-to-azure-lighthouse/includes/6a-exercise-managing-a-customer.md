In this exercise, you'll apply what you've learned so far to the new customers you have onboarded. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Return to the lab environment you have open from the previous exercise, as it contains pre-requisites needed for these scenarios.

## Exercise scenarios

### Review Azure Marketplace offers

Here you'll visit the Azure Marketplace and see the service offers published by other Microsoft Partners.

### Review your delegated customers and their Azure resource

As a Contoso user, you'll use Azure Lighthouse to view your customers, and the delegated access you have been granted. Then you'll view your customer's resources using the Azure portal and your Contoso credentials.

### Update a service offer using Azure Resource Manager templates

Finally, you'll update and deploy a change to your service offer using PowerShell, to grant your user group permission to create new managed identities in your customer's subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you have completed the deployment exercises in this lab **DO NOT CLOSE THE LAB ENVIRONMENT.** Instead, keep the lab running in a separate window, return to this course and continue with the next unit.
