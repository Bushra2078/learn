In the previous exercise, you prepared your Azure Resource Manager template files with your unique information, such as your tenantID. 

In this exercise, you will use those Azure Resource Manager templates for one deployment and then you will use the template files on Github for the remaining two customer deployments.

## Exercise scenarios

As the administrator for Contoso, you Will onboard three new customers using the following methods:

**Customer 1** requires a subscription-level deployment of your Azure Resource Manager templates, using PowerShell.

**Customer 2** requires a deployment to one resource group, called **"cust2-rg1"**, which you will action from GitHub. You'll also need the unique information you gathered earlier, such as your tenantID, but the lab will provide instructions for this.

**Customer 3** requires a deployment to two resource groups, called **"cust3-rg1"** and **"cust3-rg2"**. You will action this from GitHub, again adding your unique information during the deployment process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you have completed the deployment exercises in this lab **DO NOT CLOSE THE LAB ENVIRONMENT.** Instead, keep the lab running in a separate window, return to this course and continue with the next unit.
