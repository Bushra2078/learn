Azure Lighthouse provides two means of onboarding Azure Customers. For Lamna Healthcare, you used an Azure Resource Manager template to provision a subscription management service using Azure delegated resource management. You now want to grow and scale your Azure Lighthouse managed service offering to new customers.

Azure Lighthouse provides the means to create a service offer that you can publish to the Azure Marketplace.

In this unit, you'll see how Contoso will create a new subscription offer for deployment to the Azure Marketplace.

## Getting Started

So far, you've looked at how to onboard Lamna Healthcare using the Azure Resource Management templates. This is ideally suited to existing customers where you want to create new service offers for other resource groups or subscriptions.

Contoso is keen to scale up its managed service offering to new customers. Azure Lighthouse provides the means to create service offerings that can be published directly to the Azure Marketplace. There is almost no difference when publishing a Managed Services to any other published Marketplace offer.

### Partner Center account

In order to create a service offer, you'll need a valid Partner Center account. If you don't have one, you'll need to sign up and enroll you in the Commercial Marketplace program.

### Public and Private offers

When defining an Azure Marketplace managed service offer, you'll need to decide the target audience for the offer. Which is controlled by the type of offer you make: public or private.

- **Public**: offers of this type are visible to all Azure Marketplace users; typically, this type is used to gain new customers
- **Private**: offers of this type are only visible to named Azure Customers; typically, this type of offer is used for existing known customers

## The walkthrough

Since not everyone can access Partner Center, this unit will showcase how to create and publish a service offer to the Azure Marketplace through a video walkthrough.

This content will look at:

- The steps needed to create a managed service offer
- The difference between private and public offers
- How to configure manifest details
- The allocation of roles and authorizations
- Publishing the offer
