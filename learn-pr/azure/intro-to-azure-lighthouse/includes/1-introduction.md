You work for Contoso, an organization that delivers managed services to customers. Contoso has been approached by a prospective customer, Lamna Healthcare Company, who has recently migrated to Azure. They're a mid-sized company with no in-house expertise in Azure management. They want to focus on providing services for their customers, most of which are hospitals. While Contoso wants a managed service, they're keen to only extend the access and privileges needed to carry out administration, maintenance, and governance activities.

Microsoft has recently launched Azure Lighthouse to help service providers manage customer resources, but you know little about it. Lamna Healthcare is an important customer, and you're keen to win their business. In future, you'd also like to scale this service to manage multiple customers with as much automation as possible.

To respond, you need to get a better understanding of the capabilities of Azure Lighthouse, its features, any ancillary costs, and how it's set up and configured.

In this module, you'll learn about what Azure Lighthouse is and how it can deliver a scalable, automated process. You'll learn how to onboard a customer to provide security, monitoring, and management services at scale. Finally, you'll learn how to work on your customerâ€™s tenant, and how to publish a service offering to Azure Marketplace.
