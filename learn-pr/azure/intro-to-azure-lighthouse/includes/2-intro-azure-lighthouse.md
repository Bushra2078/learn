Contoso already has a handful of existing Azure customers that it assists from time to time, mostly by remotely logging into their Azure tenant, with an account provided by the customer.

Lamna Healthcare Company has a set of needs that's different to your previous Azure customers. The primary requirement, as always, is that you manage resources in their Azure environment. However, this customer doesn't want to hand over full control of their Azure estate to a third party. Lamna Healthcare intends to give Contoso access to manage only one subscription, including Azure SQL Databases deployed to that subscription.

Your manager has heard about Azure Lighthouse, which they believe will help meet this need. You've been asked to get a better understanding Azure Lighthouse. You want to know how it could be used to assist Lamna Healthcare, and scale across all your existing customers.

In this unit, you'll get an introduction to Azure Lighthouse, and the core features and benefits it delivers for service providers and customers alike.

## What is Azure Lighthouse?

One of the first things you'll find with Azure Lighthouse is that it's free, providing you have an existing Azure subscription. Azure Lighthouse has been designed to cater for the needs of service providers like Contoso. Lighthouse lets you manage your Azure customer's estates and resources using your own Azure environment. Which gives Contoso control from one single view, rather than having to log in to each of your customer's Azure tenants to conduct administration.

Contoso has experienced a recent increase in the number of customers wanting to use Azure and needing a quality-managed service. Azure Lighthouse looks like it will allow your company to meet this growth now and in the future.

## Core Azure Lighthouse features

At the heart of Azure Lighthouse is **Azure delegated resource management**. It's the glue that makes the managed service work by injecting a logical view of your customer's estate into your company's Azure tenant. By empowering your customers, it gives them more control over what content you can access. We'll go over that in more detail in a later unit.

One of the biggest challenges facing Contoso is how to onboard your customers and manage them at scale. Previous approaches involved your customers creating accounts on their Azure tenant for you to use. Something Lamna Healthcare is keen to avoid.

There are two ways to onboard customers like Lamna Healthcare for Azure Lighthouse. You can  use **Azure Resource Manager** templates deployed to a customer's environment. Or, use the **Cloud Partner Portal** to publish managed service offers to Azure Marketplace. You can publish targeted private offers to your existing customers, or public offers to attract new business.

Finally, to improve the managed service experience for both your company and Lamna Healthcare, the Azure portal now provides two new views. Your Service Management users can find all the customers they're managing from one location called **My Customers**. Lamna Healthcare could manage all their service providers through a dedicated page called **Service Providers**.

## Benefits of using Azure Lighthouse

Azure Lighthouse is a powerful tool that will help Contoso meet the needs of Lamna Healthcare, and provide a similar service offer to all your other Azure customers.

Here's an at-a-glance look at the key benefits of using Azure Lighthouse in your company:

- **Management at scale**: manage and scale all your customers' engagements and life-cycle operations
- **Greater visibility**: customers you manage can now see and audit your actions
- **Improved customer control**: the customer can control the scope and range of your access
- **Preservation of management IP**: Contoso can keep control and access of proprietary automation scripts because they can be run from Contoso's tenant and don't need to be shared with Lamna Healthcare
- **Improved tools**: Azure Lighthouse supports multiple license models, existing APIs, and other partner programs
- **No additional costs**: Azure Lighthouse is part of a native Azure platform
