When planning a solution in the cloud, there's always the challenge of balancing cost against performance. It can feel like a guessing game whether the selected options will stay within budget, or if we'll have a nasty surprise on our next bill!

We need to be able to confidently answer several questions:

- How can you determine what this system will cost this fiscal year? 
- Is there a configuration you could use to save money? 
- Is there a way to estimate how a change would impact your cost and performance _without_ actually trying it out in your production system?

In this module, we will explore the tools you can use to answer all these questions and more.
