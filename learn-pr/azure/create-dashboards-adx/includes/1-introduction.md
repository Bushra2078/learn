Dashboards tell a story through visualizations, and are an excellent way to monitor your data and see all of your most important insights at a glance. Azure Data Explorer provides built-in dashboards from the web UI to help you progress quickly from raw data to shared insights.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a weather enthusiast with a passion for data science, who's just explored an unfamiliar data set. You've used visualizations to show the range of data in several different dimensions, and now want to share this information with others.

## What will we be doing?

You'll create a new dashboard from a query to display query visualizations. You'll add new tiles to an existing dashboard. Then, you'll create a parameter to use as a picker in a dashboard tile. Finally, you'll learn how to manage permissions and share your dashboard with others.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

* Build dashboards in Azure Data Explorer. 
* Use parameters to interactively modify your dashboard queries.
* Apply cross-filters in your dashboard.
