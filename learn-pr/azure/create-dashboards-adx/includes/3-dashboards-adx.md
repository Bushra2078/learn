Dashboards tell a story through visualizations, and are an excellent way to monitor your data and see all of your most important insights at a glance. Dashboards aren't just pictures- they are interactive and the tiles update as the underlying data changes.

Here, you'll create a dashboard in Azure Data Explorer. 

The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called tiles. You can pin tiles to a dashboard from a query, or create new tiles within a new or existing dashboard page. 

Azure Data Explorer dashboards provide three main advantages:

* Natively export queries from the Azure Data Explorer web UI to Azure Data Explorer dashboards.
* Explore the data in the Azure Data Explorer web UI.
* Optimized dashboard rendering performance.
