Dashboards tell a story through visualizations, and are an excellent way to monitor your data and see all of your most important insights at a glance. Dashboards aren't just pictures- they are interactive and the tiles update as the underlying data changes.

The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called tiles. Tiles can display a single number, a graph, a data table, or another visualization. Tiles are dynamically linked to the source data, so they change whenever your underlying data changes. You can pin tiles to a dashboard from a query, or create new tiles within a new or existing dashboard page. 

Azure Data Explorer dashboards provide three main advantages:

* Explore the data in the Azure Data Explorer web UI. You can analyze your data in the same experience as you will use to create dashboards.
* Natively export queries from the Azure Data Explorer web UI to Azure Data Explorer dashboards. There's no need to export data to another service.
* Optimized dashboard rendering performance. Data is linked to the source, for quick rendering and data update.
