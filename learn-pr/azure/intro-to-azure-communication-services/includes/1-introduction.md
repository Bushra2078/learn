## Example scenario

Let's start with an example scenario that will help you understand the potential of ACS. Imagine you work on the engineering/product team of a household appliance producer which offers many appliances for the household such as refrigerators, washers, and dryers. As a company you've been struggling with contacting and communicating with your customers when it comes to support, sales and maintenance. 

This has lead to a number of problems in the business such as:

- Missed maintenance appointments
- Overbooked maintenance appointments
- Poor support customer satisfaction scores
- High customer bounce rate
- High percentages of incomplete orders

 You and your team have been tasked to fix this issue. The team has come up with some ideas and features such as:

- Live Chat on the website
- Video support and maintenance calls
- Streamlined maintenance booking and appointments
- SMS reminders of maintenance & installation appointments

However, the team is unsure how to proceed. Do they want to make their own solution? That's likely to be costly to develop and maintain. Budgets are tight as is time. Your company wants this problem to be solved as quickly as possible.

This scenario is exactly what Azure Communication Services can help with.
