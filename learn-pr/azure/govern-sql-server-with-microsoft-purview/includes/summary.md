Your organization stores significant amounts of data in Microsoft Azure and AWS cloud solutions and then a large amount in on-premises datacenters. There were issues associated with not having an end-to-end data lineage across your data infrastructure. As a data analyst, you determined that you were spending considerable time manually annotating, cataloging, and finding trusted sources. Additionally, your customers spent time diagnosing data issues from upstream data pipelines, and your CDO had difficulty mapping and controlling sensitive data stored in multiple locations.

Your CDO asked you to evaluate the capabilities of Microsoft Purview to enable unified data governance service, including both data stored on-premises and in multiple cloud storage solutions.

In this module, you’ve learned how to connect different data sources with Microsoft Purview to simplify data discovery and manage sensitive data. You also have learned how to register data sources and scan data.

Now that you have a central location for your data, your organization can manage and assess its data, including identifying data sources and data-mining value. Additionally, using Microsoft Purview to manage your organization’s data provides your CDO with an overview of the data, including whether it can be trusted, where it’s stored, its sensitivity, and the risks associated with storing customer content.
