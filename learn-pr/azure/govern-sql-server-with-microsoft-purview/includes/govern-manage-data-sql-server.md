Your company stores extensive data in on-premises SQL Server databases. Much of that data is correlated with existing data sets in your Azure database solution. Additionally, some of your company’s data sources are hosted in Azure VMs. You decide to use Microsoft Purview to discover and create a unique catalog of all your data sets.

## Register data sources from on-premises SQL Server

To register data sources from a SQL Server on-premises, first ensure you can register data sources successfully from a SQL Server instance that’s running either in your on-premises datacenter or in Azure VM by ensuring that:

- Your Microsoft Purview account is configured for other data sources.

- You’ve configured the Data source administrator role and Data reader roles, which are required to register a data source.

To ensure that you can register the data from SQL Server successfully, configure either SQL Authentication or Windows Authentication. Use **SQL Server Management Studio** to change and configure the authentication mode to support both SQL Server and Windows Authentication modes.

You must ensure that the account that you’ll use to scan the data on your SQL server has permission to access the master database because the Microsoft Purview scanner must enumerate the **sys.databases** that reside in the master database.

When you configure security, store the SQL login password in *Azure Key Vault*, a cloud service that helps securely store secrets. Ensure that Azure Key Vault is connected to your Microsoft Purview account.

Establish connectivity with an on-premises network by using either a virtual private network (VPN) or **Azure ExpressRoute.** For higher security configuration, consider setting up an Microsoft Purview portal private endpoint to enable connectivity with a private link to Microsoft Purview Governance Portal. You can also enable connectivity to the on-premises SQL server through the public endpoint.

## Create and manage self-hosted integration runtime

The next step is to create a [self-hosted integration runtime (SHIR)](/azure/purview/manage-integration-runtimes) in your Microsoft Purview account. Microsoft Purview uses the SHIR component to run data scans across different network environments. You first must create a Microsoft integration runtime in your Microsoft Purview account, and then download and install binaries on the on-premises machine that runs any supported 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

>[!Note]
>SHIR installation on a domain controller isn’t supported.

Also, you should configure an appropriate power plan on the computer on which you install SHIR to avoid hibernation, which prevents SHIR from responding to data requests.

## Register the Microsoft integration runtime on your computer

The computer that will host the Microsoft Integration Runtime component needs to have connectivity with your on-premises SQL Server.

It’s a best practice to test the connectivity to the on-premises SQL Server from the computer that’s hosting the Microsoft Integration Runtime infrastructure. To test the connection:

1. Open the **Microsoft Integration Runtime Configuration Manager**.

1. To open the **Diagnostics Tool**, Select **Diagnostics**.

1. Provide the source and credentials for the data source, and then run the test.

    > [!Tip]
    > If you experience any issues while running the test, create a support ticket by selecting the **Send logs** button.

## Prepare credentials in Azure Key Vault

Use Azure Key Vault to store credentials for accessing a data source from SQL Server in Azure VM. You need to create a credentials object, or *secret*, that contains a password for authenticating the data source. Ensure that the managed identity that’s representing the Microsoft Purview account has **Get** and **List** permissions for secrets. In Azure Key Vault, modify the access policy to include the Microsoft Purview account and on the **Add access policy** pane, for **Secret Management Operations**, select **Get** and **List**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/3-add-access-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add access policy pane." border="true" lightbox="../media/3-add-access-policy.png":::

> [!Note]
> You can configure the Key Vault to disable public access. However, if you do, you must enable access to trusted Microsoft services to bypass firewalls.

#### Enable integration between Microsoft Purview and Azure Key Vault

Once you create the Azure Key Vault and configure the secret, follow these steps to enable integration between Microsoft Purview and the Azure Key Vault:

1. To open the Management Center, in Microsoft Purview Governance Portal, select the **Management** link, and then select **Credentials**.

1. To start the wizard for creating a new connection, on the **Credentials** pane, select **Manage Key Vault connections**, and then select **+New**.

1. In the **New Key Vault** pane, enter the required information including name, description, your Azure subscription, and a new Key Vault name, and then select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-purview-keyvault-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Purview Credentials page with Manage Key Vault connections selected and information entered in the New Key Vault pane." border="true" lightbox="../media/3-purview-keyvault-connection.png":::


#### Create a credentials object

The next step is to create a credentials object that you’ll use to authenticate to the SQL Server Azure VM:

1. On the **Credentials** pane, select **+New**.

1. On the **New credential** pane:

    1. In the **Name** and **Description** text boxes, enter a name and description for the credential object.

    1. From the **Authentication method** drop-down list, select the authentication method.

    1. In the **User name** text box, enter a user name.

    1. In the **Password** section:

        1. From the **Key Vault connection** drop-down list, select a Key Vault connection.
        1. In the **Secret name** text box, enter the name of the secret that contains the password for SQL authentication or Windows authentication.
        1. Optionally, in the **Secret version** text box, enter the version of the secret.

## Register a data source from the Azure portal

When you meet all the prerequisites, use the Azure portal to register your on-premises SQL Server data source by performing the following steps:


1. In Microsoft Purview Governance Portal, from the **navigation** pane, select **Data map**.

1. On the **Sources** pane, select **Register**.

1. On the **Register sources** pane, select **SQL Server** and then select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-register-sql-server.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Purview Data map page with the Sources pane open and S Q L Server selected as the register source." border="true" lightbox="../media/3-register-sql-server.png":::

1. On the **Register sources (SQL Server)** pane, in the **Name** text box, enter a name for the source.

1. In the **Server endpoint** text box, enter an IP address or hostname for the server endpoint.

1. From the **Select a collection** drop-down list, select a collection, and then select **Register**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-register-sql-server-on-premises.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Register sources S Q L Server pane displaying a name, server endpoint I P address, and collection." border="true"  lightbox="../media/3-register-sql-server-on-premises.png":::


## Scan data from SQL Server on-premises

Now that your data source is integrated with your Microsoft Purview account, you’re ready to create *scan rule sets*, which are a group of scan rules that you associate with a scan.

:::image type="content" source="../media/3-system-scan-set-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Purview Data map window with Scan rule sets selected, with the SqlServer pane open, listing these System rules: government, financial, base, persona, security, and miscellaneous." border="true" lightbox="../media/3-system-scan-set-rule.png":::

You can create a custom scan rule set that includes different file types or classifications:

- Microsoft Purview provides system scan rule sets for many data-source types.

- You can create your own scan rule sets to accommodate different requirements.

To create a new scan rule set:

1. In Microsoft Purview, select **Data map**, select **Scan rule sets**, and then in the **Scan rule sets** pane, select **+New**.

1. In the **Select classification rules** pane, select one or more **System rules**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-scan-rule-sets-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Scan rule sets dialog and the Select classification rules pane are open during the process of creating a scan rule set." border="true" lightbox="../media/3-scan-rule-sets-dialog.png":::

The SQL Server scanning process captures metadata such as names and file sizes by extracting the schema from the SQL Server database.

Use the following steps to scan an on-premises SQL Server instance:

1. In Microsoft Purview Governance Portal, from the **navigation** pane, select **Data map**.

1. Select the SQL Server source that you registered previously and then select the **New scan** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-new-scan.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the New scan button to initiate a scan for data sources hosted in an on-premises S Q L Server instance." border="true" lightbox="../media/3-new-scan.png":::

1. In the **Scan** pane, provide the following information:

    1. In the **Name** text box, enter a name for the scan.

    1. From the **Connect via integration runtime** drop-down list, select a Microsoft integration runtime.

    1. In the **Server endpoint** text box, enter the IP address for the server endpoint that contains the SQL Server instance.

    1. In the **Database** name box, enter a name.

    1. From the **Credential** drop-down list, select a credential to connect to your data source via integration runtime.

    1. From the **Select a collection** drop-down list, select a collection, and then select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-new-scan-credentials.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Scan setup panel." border="true" lightbox="../media/3-new-scan-credentials.png":::

1. In the **Scope your scan** text box, enter your SQL database name, and then select **Continue**.

1. On the **Select a scan rule set** pane, select either **existing** or **create a new scan rule set**, and then select **Continue**.

1. On the **Set a scan trigger** pane, select the schedule to run the scan. Choose to scan once or create a recurring scan that runs at specific times.

1. In the final step, review your selections, and then select **Save and run**.

## Govern and manage data from SQL Server in an Azure VM by using Microsoft Purview 

The procedures for governing the data from SQL Server in an Azure VM are very similar to the procedures to govern data from SQL Server that were described previously:

1. Create and manage self-hosted integration runtime.

1. Register the Microsoft integration runtime on an Azure VM that has connectivity with your SQL Server running in Azure VM.

1. Prepare credentials in Azure Key Vault to access a data source from SQL Server in Azure VM.

1. Register a SQL Server data source in Microsoft Purview.

1. Scan data from SQL server in an Azure VM.

## Use the Data map tab to examine, manage, or delete scans

The **Data map** tab in Microsoft Purview Governance Portal contains existing scans and all previous scans that occurred. It also contains status and metrics for each scan that occurs.

After selecting the **Data map** tab, select the existing scan that you would like to manage and then select **Edit scan** to make changes to the scan. If you no longer want or need a scan, use a similar procedure to select and then delete the scan.

## Troubleshooting common scan issues

To scan a data source, ensure that you provide an account that has the required permission to access the data source. The most common problem when you initiate a scan of the data source is a lack of permissions, either to the Key Vault that is hosting secrets or to the data source.

Use the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Verify that you have all prerequisites and have followed all authentication steps for the source you are connecting to.

1. Verify that the permissions for the Microsoft Purview managed identity are set up correctly in Azure Key Vault. Ensure that you are using the right secret name and version.

1. Verify that Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is granted at least **Reader** role on the resource or is inherited from a higher scope such as a resource group or a subscription.

1. If you are using private link to connect to your data source, ensure that self-hosted integration runtime is set up correctly.
