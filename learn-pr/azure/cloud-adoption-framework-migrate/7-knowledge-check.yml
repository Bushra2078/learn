  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Validating traffic patterns and routing for user traffic is what kind of technical validation?
    choices:
    - content: User route testing
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Having the correct user route testing in place helps ensure that the network is performing as expected.
    - content:  Network isolation testing
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  Network isolation testing should be in place to test that the network has proper isolation and no unexpected network vulnerabilities.
    - content: Dependency testing
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Dependency testing should be in place to ensure that workload dependencies have been migrated and are accessible from the migrated assets.
    - content: Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) testing
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: BCDR testing should be in place to validate that any service-level agreements (SLAs) for backup and recovery are established.
  - content: What should the phase of assessing workloads in a migration project focus on?
    choices:
    - content: Form a team of Azure experts.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A team of people who understand the Azure platform should be formed as part of the migration project, but this is not necessarily the objective of assessing workloads for the project.
    - content: Gather information about cloud compatibility and dependencies between servers and assets.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This phase of the migration project should be focused on information gathering that can help your organization understand the migration path for each workload or asset.
    - content: Test and release production traffic to the migrated workloads.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The release of production to workloads in the cloud should happen after proper planning and migration.
    - content: Plan out the migration sprint phases.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Planning out the appropriate sprint phases for the project is an important step but would take place after assessment of the workloads.
  - content: An organization's migration project has stalled because the team hasn't set the correct expectations with its executive-level team. What kind of blocker is this an example of?
    choices:
    - content: Environmental blocker.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  An environmental blocker would be an improperly configured environment.
    - content:  Operations blocker.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  Not fully appreciating some of the differences between managing workloads in the cloud and managing workloads on-premises can lead to blockers within the migration project.
    - content: Technical blocker.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An example of a technical blocker would be a workload that's not suitable for migration to the cloud.
    - content: Strategy blocker.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Setting the correct expectations across your organization for factors like time frame and budget requirements is about strategy. In a migration project, avoiding strategy blockers can help prevent confusion and delays.
