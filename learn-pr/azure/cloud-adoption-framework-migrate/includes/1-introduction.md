The Migrate methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework guides you through migration to Azure by using repeatable processes and common tools.

Migration of any datacenter can involve migration of various technology platforms and workloads. Re-creating the architecture and configuration of workloads in the cloud is time consuming and produces diminishing returns. 

The Migrate methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework, the Azure migration center, and Azure Migrate tooling reduce that effort. They use repeatable processes and tools that facilitate a successful migration with minimal time and effort across all of your technology and workload needs.

In this module, you learn the tools, the processes, and the options. You can then apply that knowledge to the migration of all workloads and platforms in your current environment.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand the tools commonly used in migration
- Learn about the migration processes required to migrate effectively
- Demonstrate a migration (hands-on if possible)
- Understand options for properly migrating various platforms and workloads
- Choose the best learning path to migrate a specific platform or workload

## Prerequisites

- Foundational understanding of cloud migration
- Understanding of your organization's migration plan and the types of workloads you'll need to migrate
