Cloud Adoption Framework's Migrate methodology guides your through migration to Azure using repeatable processes and common tools.

Migration of any datacenter can involve migration of a variety of technology platforms and workloads. Recreating the architecture and configuration of workloads in the cloud is time consuming and produces diminishing returns. The Migrate methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework, the Azure Migration Hub, and Azure Migrate tooling reduces that effort through repeatable processes and tools that facilitate a successful migration with a fraction of the time and effort across all of your technology and workload needs.

In this module, you learn the tools, the processes, and the options. From there, you could apply each to the migration of all workloads and platforms in your current environment.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand the tools commonly used in migration
- Learn about the migration processes required migrate effectively
- Demonstrate a simple migration (hands-on if possible)
- Understand options for properly migrating a variety of platforms and workloads 
- Choose the best learning path to continue on with learning paths to migrate a specific platform or workload

## Prerequisites

- Foundational understanding of cloud migration
- Understanding of your organization’s migration plan and the types of workloads you’ll need to migrate
