The needs and goals of companies in the space industry can vary widely. This unit discusses several key players in that industry.

## Space manufacturers

Space manufacturers build large commercial and government satellite platforms. Space manufacturers build the satellite bus and the structural component of the satellite that contains instruments such as sensors. They play a crucial role in providing infrastructure for geosynchronous satellite operation.

## Launch service providers

Launch service providers provide the carrier rocket, assembly, payload integration, and launch. While some government organizations are equipped to conduct launches themselves, most will go through a launch service provider to put a satellite into orbit.

## Satellite operators

Satellite operators is a broad category that includes government, commercial, and private entities that own the ~4,800 satellites in orbit, both for satellite communication and observation. Operators focused on communication are generally referred to as SATCOM operators, with communications satellites used to relay signals across the globe. Operators focused on observation are generally referred to as Earth Observation (EO) operators, with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites that collect data from earth.

## Data analytics Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)

Data analytics independent software vendors aggregate and analyze insights based on satellite data. These companies use proprietary data analysis and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offerings to help customers unlock insights from the data collected by earth observation satellites.

## Ground station providers

Ground station providers provide antennas to contact satellites in orbit, enabling the downlinking of data collected by the satellites. It's important for antennas on the ground to continually monitor the status of satellites, and by providing a large network of stations across the globe, ground station providers help ensure that access.

## Enterprises

In this context, enterprises refers to non-satellite-operating businesses that need to harness the data and communication capabilities of satellites. These enterprises can be found across industries and represent an important end customer for space solutions. Examples of non-satellite-operating businesses include agricultural companies looking to perform more precise monitoring of crop health, government and financial firms who need to automate risk analysis, and logistics companies looking to identify supply chain issues more quickly.

While Azure Space products will be relevant to all key players within the industry, the portfolio is focused primarily on providing value for two: Satellite Operators and Enterprises. In the next unit, we'll examine the value propositions for them.
