The Azure Space portfolio consists of products that fall under the Azure Orbital umbrella. There are three principles that are foundational to the Azure Orbital offerings:

- **Connect**: Connect to the cloud anywhere and at any security level.
- **Analyze**: Turn space data into knowledge and insights.
- **Develop**: Enable rapid development.

## Connect

Products that fall under this category help meet needs around space-based connectivity. Some of the key Azure capabilities are:

- Access to connect through space to the Microsoft cloud, with access to Azure through satellite communications.
- Multi-vendor, multi-orbit satellite connectivity.
- A fully cloud-based ground segment to communicate with satellites.
- Co-location services, networking services and a platform for virtualization.

## Analyze

Products that fall under this category help end users create insights from space data. Some of the key Azure capabilities are:

- Connect spacecraft to Azure with the ability to command satellites and downlink to the cloud.
- A fully managed satellite ground network to provide global coverage for earth observation and remote-sensing satellites.
- A single control plane to manage antennas from one powerful application.
- Rapid data processing to derive insights and create clarity.
- Use Azure to create analytics pipelines.

## Develop

Products that fall under this category enable developers to do more with space data. Some of the key Azure capabilities are:

- The ability to build applications in the cloud and then deploy on spacecraft.
- A software architecture for hosting on-orbit applications, with common services that can be extended by satellite operators.

In the next unit, we'll examine some real-world examples of what Azure Orbital can look like in action.
