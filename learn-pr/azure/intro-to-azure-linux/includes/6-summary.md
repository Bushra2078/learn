Azure supports running Linux applications and workloads in the cloud with virtual Linux infrastructure and Linux-based service platforms.

With Linux infrastructure as a service (IaaS), you can deploy Linux applications to Azure virtual machines that run the Linux flavor of your choice. Choose from among thousands of ready-to-run images across multiple Linux distributions, many with preloaded software packages, or create and deploy your own custom images. Specify and provision your virtual machines and virtual network infrastructure with Azure Resource Manager. Scale and load-balance workloads across hundreds of identical VM instances with scale sets. Add value to your Linux-based applications with Azure services. Migrate on-premises workloads directly to Azure VMs with Azure Migrate.

Alternatively, you can use Linux-based service platforms (PaaS) like Azure App Service and Azure Kubernetes Service, which provide Linux compatibility. Azure PaaS can simplify management and maintenance of your Linux-based applications, without sacrificing the flexibility and control that a Linux foundation provides.

Regardless of your choice, Azure provides many services, features, and tools you can integrate with your applications. All of which can help you reduce your maintenance burden, accelerate development, and improve your visibility into your workloads.
