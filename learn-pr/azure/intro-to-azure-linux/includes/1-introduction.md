Microsoft Azure is a growing collection of integrated public cloud services. Including, virtual machines, networking, storage, databases, analytics, mobile, and web services. It enables you to build, manage, and deploy applications globally and at scale, by using your preferred tools and frameworks. But it's not just about Microsoft software: if your organization uses Linux-based development environments and runs production software on Linux, there's a place for you on Azure.

With Azure, you can power your applications with your preferred Linux distribution on Azure virtual machines and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, for elasticity based on demand. The virtual network infrastructure of Azure, and its tools and applications, can add value to your Linux-based apps. You can also take full advantage of the unique managed service platforms (platform as a service) on Azure. These platforms enable you to reduce the management burden of your applications without sacrificing the Linux foundation that you rely on. Microsoft is a neutral technology provider, working with all major Linux distribution partners and community distributions to offer you the most comprehensive choice of Linux and Linux-based apps.

In this module, you see what it means to run Linux on Azure, and how to think about moving your Linux applications and workloads to the cloud. You learn about the value of the Azure virtual Linux infrastructure and Linux-based service platforms, and how and when to think about taking advantage of both.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Differentiate between Linux on Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) computing, and assess the value of each.
- Describe Azure tools and services that bring extra value to Linux workloads.
- Explain the components of Linux virtual infrastructure in Azure, and the role of Microsoft in supporting different Linux distributions.
- Describe the value of Linux-based service platforms on Azure.
- Envision building new Linux-based workloads and migrating existing workloads to Azure.
- Evaluate whether Linux on Azure is the right choice for your solutions.

## Prerequisite

Beginner-level familiarity with the fundamental concepts of cloud computing, including IaaS and PaaS. You can find an overview of these concepts in [Discuss Azure fundamental concepts](/training/modules/fundamental-azure-concepts/).
