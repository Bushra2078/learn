So far, we've discussed what it really means to use Linux on Azure, and how to build solutions that take advantage of it and all of the other products and services that Azure has to offer. Here, we'll look at some of the factors in making a decision to use Linux on Azure.

|||
| --- | --- |
| **Current development and deployment platform** | If your organization already uses Linux to develop and deploy software, Linux on Azure provides a native experience for your workloads. |
| **Simplified maintenance** | Whether you use IaaS or PaaS, or a mixture of both, Azure can simplify management and reduce the infrastructure operation and maintenance overhead of your Linux-based applications. |
| **Elasticity** | Give your Linux applications instant scalability by deploying to virtual machine scale sets or scalable Azure PaaS platforms like App Service for Linux. |
| **Simplified and reduced costs** | Enjoy flexible payment options for your business including pay as you go, pre-paid software plans, Enterprise Agreement, reserved instances or bring your own license to leverage your existing investments more cost-effectively. |
| **Support** | Take advantage of technical experts directly from your Linux distribution publisher with integrated co-located support from Red Hat and SUSE. The one-ticket-to-solution approach reduces your frustration of multiple contact points and speeds up troubleshooting. |
| **Jointly-developed solutions for specialized scenarios** | Solutions like SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP and for HPC are available as ready-to-run VM images. Value-added services built with partners such as Azure Oracle interconnect and Azure Red Hat OpenShift make your onboarding to the cloud smoother, and you can offload the infrastructure maintenance to Microsoft and the Linux partner ecosystem. |
| **Neutral technology partner** | Microsoft is a neutral technology partner that does not aim to build services that compete with its customers. |
