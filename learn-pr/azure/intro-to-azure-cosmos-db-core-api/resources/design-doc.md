## Outline

1. **Introduction**
    - Suppose you work as the lead developer at a retail company. Your team is building your online storefront. The new storefront will be designed to be accessible across various devices including mobile. The team expects a spike in demand when the storefront is published and various "grand opening" sales begin.
    - As the lead developer, you have been tasked with identifying a database platform. The database platforms you consider should be able to service the data your team will generate and collect over time. The selected database should also be able to handle a large variety of data, at high volumes and velocity. Your database solution needs to scale quickly and with little friction in order to handle this demand that is both growing and variable.
