Let's start with a few definitions and a quick tour through Azure Cosmos DB SQL API. This overview should help you see whether Azure Cosmos DB might be a good fit for your work.

## What is a NoSQL database?

Many modern applications require high performance for operations and high-availability for mission critical workloads. NoSQL databases are designed to meet these needs. NoSQL databases generally do not enforce relational constraints or put locks on data, making writes fast. They are also often horizontally scalable via sharding or partitioning, which allows them to maintain high-performance regardless of size.

## Why use a scale-out database?

High transaction workloads can necessitate that a data workload is manually scaled out across multiple data stores in various regions or datacenters. Manual scaling out a database is a time consuming and difficult process to implement. *Scale-out databases* are NoSQL database solutions that are designed, from the onset, to be distributed across multiple compute and storage nodes in a manner that can be scaled.

NoSQL databases are often distributed, both by storing data in multiple local replicas and storing data across large distances over a network, providing resiliency to both local failures and regional outages.

> [!TIP]
> Maintenance of a distributed database can still be a costly and time-consuming factor. When considering a distributed database system, consider how much maintenance is involved in managing all aspects of the system.

## What is Azure Cosmos DB SQL API?

Azure Cosmos DB is a NoSQL database service that offers rich querying over diverse data, helps deliver configurable and reliable performance, is globally distributed, and enables rapid development.

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database service for modern app development that provides guaranteed single-digit millisecond response times and 99.999-percent availability, backed by SLAs with automatic and instant scalability.

- **No NoSQL administration experience required**: No one on your team will need to manage deployments, maintain database servers, manually scale instances, or patch servers.
- **Global distribution**: Distributing your data to multiple regions around the globe is merely a low friction option in the Azure portal.
- **Elastic scale**: As your data needs grow, you can elastically store more data and increase throughput without the need to deploy new servers.
- **Comprehensive SLAs**: Azure Cosmos DB offers comprehensive 99.99% SLAs that covers guarantees in four different areas; Throughput, consistency, availability, and latency.

Azure Cosmos DB achieves these advantages through a managed platform thatâ€™s backed by the power and reach of Microsoft Azure. Azure Cosmos DB is uniquely positioned to handle these challenges because of it's global reach, automatic and instant scale, open-source APIs for existing NoSQL engines, and SLA-backed speed and availability.

Azure Cosmos DB simplifies development by integrating with key Azure services, existing database APIs or SDKs, and automatically distributing and indexing data. Azure Cosmos DB is also fully managed minimizing the amount of effort required to maintain your globally distributed data. Additionally, Azure Cosmos DB offers multiple service models and throughput options to accommodate a wide variety of workloads, data types, and performance requirements.

## What is a JSON document?

JavaScript Object Notation, or [JSON](https://www.json.org), is a lightweight data format. JSON was built to be highly compatible with the literal notation of an object in the JavaScript language. Many frameworks, browsers, and even databases support JavaScript natively making JSON a popular format for transmitting and storing data.

## What is Azure Cosmos DB SQL API?

The Azure Cosmos DB SQL API is the native API for the database platform. Applications can arbitrarily store native JSON documents with flexible schema. Data is indexed automatically and is available for query using a flavor of the SQL query language designed for JSON data. the SQL API also supports cross-document transactions written in JavaScript and executed server-side. The SQL API can be accessed using SDKs for popular frameworks such as [.NET](/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sdk-dotnet-standard), [Python](/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sdk-python), [Java](/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sdk-java-v4), and [Node.js](/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sdk-node). The SQL API can also be accessed using a [RESTful HTTP API](/rest/api/cosmos-db/) endpoint.
