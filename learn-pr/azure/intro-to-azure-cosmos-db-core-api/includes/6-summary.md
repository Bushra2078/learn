Your development team has given you the responsibility of identifying a database platform that can service the variety, volume, and velocity of data your team will generate as part of it's retail storefront.

Azure Cosmos DB SQL API is a great choice for this scenario. Azure Cosmos DB SQL API will allow you to get the store's database launched with relatively little friction and will grow with your company as your needs evolve.

Imagine how difficult it would be to implement a schema to support all the different telemetric data from orders, notifications, inventory, and fulfillment. Further, imagine how challenging it would be to provision and dispose of databases in real time to match the number of customers that are shopping at your storefront at any point-in-time. Even more, imagine the massive maintenance challenge that would occur if there was an exponentially increase in demand for a product overnight.

Azure Cosmos DB SQL API eases many of these pain points by offering an elastic and globally distributed database platform. Azure Cosmos DB SQL API will scale up-and-down to meet your real-world usage. The SQL API for Azure Cosmos DB SQL API is the built-in native API with the widest variety of SDK options for developers in your organization. The SQL API also natively uses JSON documents enabling your team to store a wide variety of data formats in your database.

Now, your team can move forward and create a new Azure Cosmos DB SQL API account for your storefront.
