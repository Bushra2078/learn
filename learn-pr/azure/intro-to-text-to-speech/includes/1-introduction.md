Text-to-speech converts text into human-like speech. It helps create immersive applications while making information accessible to a broad spectrum of users by enabling text to be read to them. When used in combination with other Azure Cognitive Services such as Translator, you can dramatically increase the potential audience of users.

You can tailor the speech output to fit your needs, with more than 215 built-in voices, 60 languages and dialects, and custom voices. These functions eliminate usersâ€™ need to read large amounts of text, and can generate speech in multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
