With the rising awareness around the importance of accessibility, Text-to-speech is becoming more popular as it helps you reach a wider audience by overcoming the traditional limitations of written text. Further, Text-to-speech is increasingly being used in business-customer interactions through devices like phones, smart speakers, TVs, laptops, and cars to improve customers experience.

## Assistive Technology

**Neural voice** provides clear, natural sounding speech, with the ability to adjust pitch, tone, rhythm, and speaking styles. This customization means individuals can find the sound that best suits their character or preferred gender presentation. Overall resulting in individuals being able to find their voice and make it their own.

Further, neural voices are shown to significantly reduce listening fatigue, making them ideal for repetitive announcements and in-car navigation use. This is especially true for long-haul drivers, as neural voices can help drivers stay more alert and ensures they don't tune out the alerts they receive.

Text-to-speech can also improve the accessibility of apps for people with visual impairments and other diverse needs. For learning differences such as dyslexia, Text-to-speech promotes independent learning by synthesizing audio in real-time. Further, the Long Audio API can open up a world of literature that may otherwise be inaccessible.

## Public service announcements

Broadcasts to the public have to be easily understood and trusted. Text-to-speech can partner with services such as translator to help organizations quickly release information to the public. Text-to-speech also offers multiple dialects creating wider accessibility and understanding in multilingual regions. This wider understanding can result in a deeper public trust of the government systems in place, and the knowledge that groups aren't being left out of vital information announcements.

## Online learning

Educational courses can use the customizability of Text-to-speech with SSML and Custom voice to satisfy the complex requirements of some subjects. Text-to-speech supports abbreviations, acronym expansions, and date/time interpretations. What's more, unique voices allow multi-character scenarios. For instance, medical triage training may require the pronunciation of complex medical language, and an obvious separation between the voices of a doctor and a patient.

## Audiobooks

By leveraging the **Long audio API** and **neural** or **custom voices**, authors and publishers can convert digital text, such as e-books, into audiobooks, making literature more accessible to a wider range of users.

## Customer service chatbots

Conversational AI chatbots can automate some call center operations, with Text-to-speech providing human-sounding voices that you can tailor to more friendly and conversational tones. These speech options reduce friction when customers are interacting with AI services as shown by organizations, such as the BBC and Progressive Insurance, which have had success creating one-of-a-kind voices using custom neural voice.
