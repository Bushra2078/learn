Text-to-speech converts text into human-sounding speech using Artificial Intelligence. The service can function on many platforms, and is capable of a range of voices and languages, including regional and gendered voices. You're also able to customize the voices to your particular requirements, with voice style, speaking speed, and pitch to create unique voices for each application. Further, you can get facial pose events and facial position information to animate a virtual face in your app. This feature adds more interactive aspects to your application, along with increasing accessibility through lip reading capabilities.

## Types of voices

**Standard voice** is the simplest and most cost-effective type of voice. In the past few years standard voice has improved considerably to provide a human-like voice in multiple regional dialects, such as Hindi or Irish English. Regional dialects provide greater clarity of pronunciation of region-specific words or phrases, making for more understandable and accessible accents.

**Neural voice** is a new type of synthesized speech that’s nearly indistinguishable from human recordings. Powered by deep neural networks, neural voices sound more natural than standard voices by producing human-like speech patterns, such as stress and loudness of individual words. Because of this human-like speech, you end up with a more precise articulation of words, along with a significant reduction in listening fatigue when users interact with AI systems.

For example, if Text-to-speech was used in an airport for flight information, neural voice could potentially reduce the number of missed announcements because of the ability to add emphasis and inflections. Meaning that you can add more or less stress for different announcements depending on their purpose, which can help minimize passengers automatically tuning out important messages and reduce listening fatigue for workers.

**Custom neural voice** uses your own audio data to create a one-of-a-kind customized synthetic voice. Custom neural voice has the deepest level of voice personalization, with realistic speech that can be used to represent brands, personify machines, and allow users to interact with applications conversationally.

> [!NOTE]
> **What if it’s a long body of text?**
> The Long Audio API allows long-form text, such as documents or news articles, to be converted into speech. The Long Audio API can create synthesized audio longer than 10 minutes, making it ideal for those wishing to create more accessible content and reach a wider audience.
