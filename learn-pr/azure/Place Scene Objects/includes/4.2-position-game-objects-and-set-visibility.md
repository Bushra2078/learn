## Position game objects and set visibility

There are numerous situations when you want to position your game objects in an appropriate place or order. Unity assists you in moving, rotating, and scaling the game object.

You can use the highlighted options to move, rotate, scale, RectTransform, and Transform, respectively. RectTransform is used for changing the position of 2D objects such as sprites. Transform combines move, rotate, and scale tools. Positioning the game objects on the scene is a crucial step, as it helps you decide where your holograms must be placed in the surrounding. An experienced unity developer used this all the time to place objects on the scene systematically. It is frequently used to adjust the placements of objects and place them in their rightful position. This is one practice that all developers must use during the development phase.

## Parent Object

In Unity, objects use a hierarchy system where objects can become "parents" of other objects. You can create game objects when you want that object to perform all the transform changes concerning the parent game object instead of the game world. You can create a parent game object by simply dragging and dropping the game object you want as a child object onto the object you want as a parent game object. Parent game objects are created frequently while developing anything in Unity.

## Prefab

Prefabs are distinct components that allow completely configured game objects to be retained in a project for future use. They are crucial elements used to carry out broad changes across the project; any edits that you make to a Prefab Asset are automatically reflected in the instances of that Prefab. These prefabs can be shared between scenes or even other projects without configuring them again. It is good practice to form prefabs while working in unity to avoid rework in the future.

## Scene Visibility

Scene Visibility control allows you to hide and show game objects in the scene without changing the in-game visibility. Scene Visibility is helpful while working on complex scenes with a lot of game objects. Using visibility is a preferred option over deactivating the game objects because visibility only affects the scene view, implying that you cannot accidentally remove game objects from a fully rendered scene. You can hide the game objects by simply clicking on the “eye” icon present beside its name in the hierarchy window, as shown in the figure.
