In the scenario for this module, the startup retailer you work for uses Elastic on-premises to manage sales transactions. The company asked you to migrate the Elastic workload to the cloud to improve data accessibility for remote workers from other departments and reduce the IT burden of maintaining infrastructure. 

Using the Elasticsearch (self-managed) template from the Azure Marketplace, you deployed Elastic on Azure VMs. This method allowed you to deploy Elastic using built-in best practices through an intuitive UI template. With Elastic deployed on the cloud, you can now begin your data migration.
