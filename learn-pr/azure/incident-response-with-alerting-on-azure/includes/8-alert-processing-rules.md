Alert processing rules allow you to apply processing on fired alerts, such as adding or suppressing an action group in a fired alert. 

Alert processing rules are different from alert rules. Alert rules generate new alerts. Alert processing rules modify the fired alerts as they're being fired.

You can apply alert processing rules to different resource scopes, from a single resource, or to an entire subscription. You can also use them to apply various filters or have the rule work on a predefined schedule.

You can use alert processing rules to:

- Suppress notifications during planned maintenance
- Implement management at scale
- Add an action group to all alert types
