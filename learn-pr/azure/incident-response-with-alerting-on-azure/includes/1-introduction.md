Microsoft Azure provides a robust alerting and monitoring solution: Azure Monitor. You use Azure Monitor to configure notifications and alerts for your key systems and applications. These alerts will ensure the correct team knows when a problem arises.  

You work for a large shipping company that recently deployed several web applications to the Azure platform. Due to a configuration error the customer facing order tracker was offline. The issue wasn't identified until customers started complaining they were unable to track their orders. As a consequence, there was a large drop in customer satisfaction with your service.

As your company's Azure solution architect, you need to find a solution that detects problems in your environments in real time. The correct team will be notified, enabling them to then resolve any problems before they become an issue for your customers.
