  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which of the following don't need to be part of recovery steps in your DR plan?'
    choices:
    - content: 'How to restore backups.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The steps to restore backups are a critical piece of a recovery plan.'
    - content: 'How to fail over to replicated systems.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The process to fail over to replicated systems is a critical piece of a recovery plan.'
    - content: 'How to reestablish network connectivity to on-premises or external networks.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The steps to reestablish network connectivity to on-premises or external networks are critical pieces of a recovery plan.'
    - content: 'How to implement replication from scratch.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'You don't implement replication from scratch. Most fully featured database products and services include some kind of replication as a tightly integrated feature.'

  - content: "Are data replication and data backup the same thing?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Yes.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both data replication and data backup copy your data, but replication creates copies of live data for failover, while backup creates long-lived, read-only data snapshots to use for recovery."
    - content: 'No.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Replication creates real-time or near-real-time copies of live data to use in failover, while backup creates long-lived, read-only snapshots of data to use in recovery."
