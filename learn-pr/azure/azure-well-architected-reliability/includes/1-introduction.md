Your business relies on access to the systems and data that make it run. Every minute that your customers or your internal teams don’t have access to what they need can result in a loss of revenue. It is our job to make sure that doesn’t happen.

As we learn about the *Reliability* pillar of the Azure Well-Architected framework, we'll see how one fictional Azure customer puts these principles to work. Lamna Healthcare is a national healthcare provider. Their IT organization has recently started to move the majority of their IT systems to Azure. They have a mixture of custom apps, open-source apps, and off-the-shelf applications, with varying architectures and technology platforms. We'll learn what they need to do to migrate to the cloud while keeping their systems and data secure.

The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud. For more details on the Azure Well-Architected framework visit the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework?azure-portal=true) as you start planning and designing your architecture.
