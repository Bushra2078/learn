Your business relies on access to its systems and data. Each moment that a customer or internal team can't access what they need can result in a loss of revenue. It's your job to prevent that by designing and implementing reliable systems. In this module, you learn about the [Reliability](/azure/well-architected/resiliency) pillar of the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected).

The concepts this module discusses aren't all-inclusive, but represent some of the most important reliability considerations for building cloud solutions. For more guidance on designing and implementing well-architected Azure solutions, see the [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture).
