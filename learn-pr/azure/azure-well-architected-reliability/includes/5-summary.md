We've discussed some key principles of the Reliability pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework. You've seen how to make your application available and recoverable by architecting for high availability, disaster recovery, and backups. 

You've seen how to use availability sets and availability zones on Azure to provide HA for VM workloads. You can use load balancing services such as Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Application Gateway, and Azure Load Balancer to distribute load across available systems. PaaS services have HA built in, so leverage these services in your architecture where possible

You've learned about disaster recovery, and how to define RPO and RTO for your application. You've learned about Azure Site Recovery and how it can provide recovery capabilities for your applications. You now understand the importance of testing your recovery plans to ensure they provide sufficient protection for your applications.

You also learned about incorporating backup and restore into your recovery strategy for protection for isolated data loss scenarios. You've seen how you can use Azure Backup for virtual machines, and about the backup and restore capabilities for several PaaS services.
