  questions:
  - content: "Why is an SLA important to define for your application?"
    choices:
    - content: "An SLA helps you determine your backup retention requirements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Backup retention is important to define, but it isn't driven by SLA."
    - content: "An SLA helps you determine the availability level that you commit to for your customers."

      explanation: "A highly available architecture uses load balancing to distribute load to available systems and remove failed systems from the load."
    - content: "Availability zones."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A highly available architecture uses availability zones to distribute systems across multiple datacenters within a region."
    - content: "Availability sets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A highly available architecture uses availability sets to minimize the impact from localized failures and maintenance events."
    - content: "Recovery Services vaults."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Recovery Services vaults provide a destination for backups, but they aren't part of a highly available architecture."
