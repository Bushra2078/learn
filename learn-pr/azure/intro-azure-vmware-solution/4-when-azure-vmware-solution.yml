  questions:
  - content: "Which data import method is best for importing daily traffic-camera video data when you have moderate to high network bandwidth?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data Box Gateway"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Data Box Gateway is ideally suited to continuous ingestion scenarios."
    - content: "Data Box Edge"
