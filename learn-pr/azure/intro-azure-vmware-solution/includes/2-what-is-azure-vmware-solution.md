## Discover Azure VMware Solution

Every company is in a different place when it comes to its digital transformation journey and use of the cloud.  In partnership with VMware, Microsoft has created the Azure VMware Solution (AVS). AVS enables organizations to efficiently move existing VMware apps to Azure.

With the Azure VMware Solution, you run your VMware estate or a single app on dedicated Azure infrastructure. AVS becomes a platform by which VMware workloads easily be modernized through integration with Azure services such as Azure Active Directory, Azure AI, and Analytics enabling new, intelligent experiences. 

AVS provides value to customers in six  core pillars:

**Unified Azure experience** Single portal interface on Azure with no connection to any third-party services. Allows customers to take advantage of a consistent Azure experience and benefits from the continual improvements to that experience over time

**Use Existing VMware investments** You can use all of your existing investments in VMware:
- Training
- Process management
- Change management
- Tooling

**Azure Native Integration** Connect to Azure services endpoints easily and natively. For example, use Azure Active Directory as the VMware vCenter SSO identity source

**Single Point of Support** Azure VMware Solution is Microsoft developed, operated, and supported. Microsoft is the first and only contact and coordinates support with VMware as required

**Unified Licensing and Consumption** Avoid licensing complexity by working with a single vendor for licensing and resource consumption. Track VMware licensing directly with resource nodes as they are deployed and decommissioned

**Azure Hybrid Use Benefits** Maximize the value of existing Windows Server and SQL Server licenses. Save up to 80% with AHUB and Azure Reserved Instances

## What is Azure VMware Solution

Azure VMware Solution is a VMware validated solution with on-going certification and testing of enhancements and upgrades. Microsoft manages and maintains the infrastructure and software, allowing you to focus on developing and running workloads that are critical to your business.

Azure VMware Solution (AVS) provides you with a dedicated, private cloud that contains VMware vSphere clusters built from bare-metal Azure infrastructure. The minimum initial deployment is three hosts, per VMware production best-practices, and more hosts can be added, up to a maximum of 16 hosts per cluster. You can have multiple clusters deployed into different Azure regions. All provisioned private clouds have standard, supported versions of VMware vCenter Server, vSAN, vSphere, and NSX-T included and fully licensed. You can migrate workloads from your on-premises environments, deploy new virtual machines (VMs), and connect workloads directly to Azure services.


The diagram above illustrates the relationship between private clouds and networks in Azure, Azure services, and on-premises environments. Network access from AVS to Azure services or networks provides reliable, high-speed integration of Azure service endpoints. ExpressRoute Global Reach connects your on-premises environment to your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, providing a unified experience for users and customers accessing AVS-based workloads.
