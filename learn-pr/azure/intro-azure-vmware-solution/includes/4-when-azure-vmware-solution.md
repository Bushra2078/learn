Organizations are using the Azure VMware Solution in many different ways to extend the value of their existing investments while getting started with the cloud. The migration to AVS gives access to Azure services and tools to modernize your data center and applications. 

This unit you will walk you the different use cases for deploying AVS, provide integration examples, and customer success stories.

### Azure VMware Solution use cases
With the Azure VMware Solution, you can run your VMware estate—or a single app—on dedicated Azure infrastructure. The solution provides a fast path to adopt the cloud, without the added work of having to reformat existing assets to work in the new cloud environment. AVS use cases:

- New VMware VM workloads in the cloud
- VM workload bursting to the cloud (on-premises to Azure VMware Solution only)
- VM workload migration to the cloud (on-premises to Azure VMware Solution only)
- Disaster recovery (Azure VMware Solution to Azure VMware Solution or on-premises to Azure VMware Solution)
- Consumption of Azure services

### Azure native integration

The Azure VMware Solution provides a fast path to adopt the cloud without the added pain of having to reformat existing assets to work in the new cloud environment. AVS removes that challenge by making it possible to run your VMware estate on Azure as if it were on-premises. Organizations are using the Azure VMware Solution many different ways to extend the value of their existing investments while getting started with the cloud.

- Log Analytics workspace: Log Analytics workspace is a unique environment to store log data. Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration. Data sources and solutions are configured to store their data in a specific workspace.
- Azure Security Center: Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system. It strengthens security of data centers, and provides advanced threat protection across hybrid workloads in the cloud or on premises.
- Azure Sentinel: Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) solution. It provides security analytics, alert detection, and automated threat response across an environment.
- Integrate Azure NetApp Files with Azure VMware Solution. Azure NetApp Files shares can be mounted from VMs that are created in the Azure VMware Solution environment. Azure NetApp Files supports Server Message Block (SMB) and Network File System (NFS) protocols. This support means the volumes can be mounted on the Linux client and can be mapped on Windows client. 
- Back up VMware VMs with Azure Backup Server. Using Azure Backup Server (MABS) back-up VMware VMs running on VMware ESXi hosts/vCenter Server to Azure.
- Monitor and manage Azure VMware Solution VMs. Microsoft Azure native tools allow you to monitor and manage your virtual machines (VMs) in the Azure environment. Yet they also allow you to monitor and manage your VMs on Azure VMware Solution and your on-premises VMs.
- Protect web apps on Azure VMware Solution with Azure Application Gateway. Azure Application Gateway is a layer 7 web traffic load balancer that lets you manage traffic to your web applications
- Deploy Traffic Manager to balance Azure VMware Solution workloads. The integration balances application workloads across multiple endpoints

### Customer success story

Azure VMware Solution has provided organizations across different industries a way to rapidly scale their infrastructure without large upfront costs. This flexibility can provide an edge to organizations.
