### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, the learner will be able to:

1. Evaluate the suitability of the Azure VMware Solution to solve existing business problems
2. Identify the key differences between Azure VMware Service and running VMware on-premises.
3. Analyze how the Azure VMware Solution can reduce licensing costs for customers.

## Create context for your module with a real-world scenario

Imagine you work for a healthcare company who runs much of their production workloads on a VMware platform. IT operations are spread between a number of different offices and there are a few trends that have surfaced in recent months. A number of different offices have equipment nearing end of life, so hardware refresh decisions need to be made in short order. Additionally, your company is not able to procure new infrastructure quickly enough to meet requests for hardware refreshes and new applications. The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take at least 4 to 6 months, if not longer. One avenue your company is interested in involves migrating VMware workloads to the cloud without changing virtualization platforms or altering existing operational patterns.


1. **Introduction**

Azure VMware Solution lets you migrate entire VMware clusters intact to Azure, and take advantage of the depth and breadth of Azure without requiring a wholesale change of operational processes.

The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take at least 4 to 6 months, if not longer. One avenue your company is interested in exploring involves Azure VMware Solution. You've been tasked with determining if this solution is a viable option for both migration and future expansion.

In this module, you will explore the business value of Azure VMware Solution and learn about the use cases that drive its adoption. You will learn the basic components of the service and the options for inter-datacenter connectivity, and will evaluate the impact of the service on existing licensing using the Azure Hybrid Benefits.  

By the end of this module, you will be able to evaluate if Azure VMware solution is the proper next step for your company's journey to the cloud.

1. **Summary**

    You need to evaluate options for migrating your production workloads out of your on-premises data center. You need to maintain your existing investments in training and operational processes, but want to avoid incurring more datacenter and hardware ownership costs, and you need to move quickly.

    *The Azure VMware Solution allowed you to redeploy your VMware environment as-is, including all automation and operational knowledge, and scale the size of the environment dynamically.*

    What used to take days, or even weeks, to deploy was now available on-demand across multiple Azure regions, and capable of scaling to meet the needs to all production workloads. With connectivity options to suit your deployment, integration with many Azure services that can improve performance and capabilities, full Microsoft support, and clear licensing benefits, Azure VMware Solution dramatically reduced the challenges of deploying a VMware Private Cloud environment.
