## Create context for your module with a real-world scenario

Imagine you work for a healthcare company. IT operations is spread between a number of different offices and there are a few trends that have surfaced in recent months. A number of different offices have equipment nearing end of life, so hardware refresh decisions need to be made in short order. Additionally, your company is not able to procure new infrastructure quickly enough to meet requests for hardware refreshes and new applications. The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take at least 4 to 6 months, if not longer. One avenue your company is interested in involves migrating VMware workloads to the cloud without changing virtualization platforms or altering existing operational patterns.


## Break up your module into units
Take your main exercise (which will be the same as your scenario) and split it into 2-3 high-level tasks. 

| Unit Task   | Conceptual unit title | Practice unit title |
| :---------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| 1. Scenario | Introduction          | N/A                 |
| 2. TODO     | TODO                  | TODO                |
| 3. TODO     | TODO                  | TODO                |
| 4. TODO     | TODO                  | TODO                |
| 5. Summary  | Summary               | N/A                 |




## Outline the content for each unit

Here, we'll create a quick outline to think through what content is needed for the learner to be able to accomplish the task.

1. **Introduction**

Azure VMware Solution lets you migrate entire VMware clusters intact to Azure, and take advantage of the depth and breadth of Azure without requiring a wholesale change of operational processes.

Imagine you work for a healthcare company. IT operations is spread between a number of different offices and there are a few trends that have surfaced in recent months. A number of different offices have equipment nearing end of life, so hardware refresh decisions need to be made in short order. Additionally, your company is not able to procure new infrastructure quickly enough to meet requests for hardware refreshes and new applications. The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take at least 4 to 6 months, if not longer. One avenue your company is interested in exploring involves Azure VMware Solution. You've been tasked with determining if this solution is a viable option for both migration and future expansion.

In this module you will explore the business value of Azure VMware Solution and learn about the use cases that drive its adoption. You will learn the basic components of the service and the options for inter-datacenter connectivity, and will evaluate the impact of the service on existing licensing using the Azure Hybrid Benefits.  

By the end of this module, you will be able to evaluate if Azure VMware solution is the proper next step for your company's journey to the cloud.
