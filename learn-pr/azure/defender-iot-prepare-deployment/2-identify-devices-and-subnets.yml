  questions:
  
  - content: "Figure A shows a network diagram depicting three floors, each with endpoints and switches. Floor three also houses  firewalls, core switches, a server, and routers. The blue dotted line depicts traffic traveling outside of the IP segment and the red line depicts interesting traffic.  Where should you put a Defender for IoT sensor?"
    choices:
    - content: "A" 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It is recommended to place sensors to stream interesting traffic to Defender for IoT."
    - content: "B"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it could be useful to capture traffic traveling outside of the IP segment, placing a sensor in location B would not transfer interesting traffic to Defender for IoT."
    - content: "C"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it could be useful to capture traffic traveling outside of the IP segment, placing a sensor in location C would not transfer interesting traffic to Defender for IoT."  

  - content: "What at factors should you consider when choosing a traffic mirroring method for each sensor?"
    choices:
    - content: "Place your sensor where you can see all or most of your OT traffic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Your sensor should be placed to see all or most of your OT traffic, typically between level 2 and 3 or 3 and 3.5 on the Purdue model."
    - content: "Place your sensor where you can see all or most of your IT traffic."
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "You are trying to monitor OT traffic so your sensor should be placed where you can see all or most of your OT traffic."
    - content: "Place your sensor where you can see all or most of your OT and IT traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You are trying to monitor OT traffic so your sensor should be placed where you can see all or most of your OT traffic."
