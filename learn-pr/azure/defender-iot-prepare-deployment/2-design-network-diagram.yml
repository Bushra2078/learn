  questions:
  
  - content: "What can your network diagram help you determine?"
    choices:
    - content: "The most interesting traffic for security and operational risks. network segments you should monitor (subnets/VLANs)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The most interesting traffic is one among many things your network diagram can help you determine."
    - content: "The most popular devices in your network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you might be able to determine the most popular devices in your network, your network diagram is intended to help you figure out where to install Defender for IoT sensors."
    - content: "The ideal temperature to run a subnet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Your network diagram is intended to help you determine where to implement your Defender for IoT sensors."  

  - content: "Where on the Purdue model would be a likely place to place your Defender for IoT sensor?"
    choices:
    - content: "Between levels 4 and 5."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Level 4 and 5 on the Purdue model represents IT resources. You want to monitor OT traffic."
    - content: "Between levels 2 and 3."
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "You're trying to monitor OT traffic so your sensor should be placed where you can see all or most of your OT traffic."
    - content: "Between levels 1 and 2."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Defenders for IoT sensors are typically placed where they can collect a greater amount of interesting traffic. Placing the sensor between level 1 and 2 wouldn't allow the sensor to collect necessary interesting traffic."
