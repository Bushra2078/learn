 To deploy Defender for IoT for OT monitoring in your car manufacturer across global locations, requires preparation in addition to planning. Preparation is part of the first stage of your OT monitoring deployment path. 

## Defender for IoT for OT deployment path

The phases include:

- Plan and prepare, done by your architecture teams
- Onboard your planned sensors, done by your deployment teams
- Site networking setup, done by your connectivity teams
- Deploy sensors, done by your deployment teams
- Calibrate and fine-tune, done by your deployment teams

At the end of your deployment, baseline learning ends with a set of learned network traffic, and operation mode begins.

## OT site deployment preparation phase

This module describes the prepare phase, which is part of the *plan and prepare* phase of deployment. You already completed your deployment plan. Including how you'll segment your network into sites and zones, the sensor connection methods to use, and the types of users and roles you'll want for each sensor.

In the planning phase, you examine your network diagram to determine which subnets and devices to monitor for traffic. You use this information in order to create a list of the OT sensors you need and where. You prepare the traffic mirroring method to use for each OT sensor, and prepare to choose the appliances you'll need for your sensor choices. The next units will cover these preparation steps.
