In this module, you prepared your OT site for Defender for IoT implementation. Including:

- Deciding what devices and subnets to monitor
- Choosing the best traffic monitoring methods for your sensors
- Deciding what appliances to use for your sensors

In order to prepare you:

- Analyzed your site diagram to determine which devices and subnets to monitor
- Checked the types of sensors you'd be using and matched them to traffic monitoring methods such as TAP or ERSPAN
- Mapped pre-configured or self-configured physical appliances or virtual appliances to the types of sensors you would be using

Preparing brings you closer to deploying your Defender for IoT implementation.
