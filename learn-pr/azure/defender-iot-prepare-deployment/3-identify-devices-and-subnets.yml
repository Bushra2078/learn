  questions:
  
  - content: "Figure A shows a network diagram depicting three floors, each with endpoints and switches. Floor three also houses  firewalls, core switches, a server, and routers. The blue dotted line depicts traffic traveling outside of the IP segment and the red line depicts interesting traffic.  Where should you put a Defender for IoT sensor?"
    choices:
    - content: "A" 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It's recommended to place sensors to stream interesting traffic to Defender for IoT."
    - content: "B"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it could be useful to capture traffic traveling outside of the IP segment, placing a sensor in location B wouldn't transfer interesting traffic to Defender for IoT."
    - content: "C"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it could be useful to capture traffic traveling outside of the IP segment, placing a sensor in location C wouldn't transfer interesting traffic to Defender for IoT."  

  - content: "Which would be an interesting traffic point to identify?"
    choices:
    - content: "Traffic that isn't uni-directional."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Traffic that travels in two directions is interesting to monitor."
    - content: "Traffic that isn't broadcast or multicast."
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Broadcast or multicast traffic are considered interesting traffic points to monitor."
    - content: "Traffic that doesn't pose a risk to the network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You're interested in monitoring traffic that could pose a risk to your network."
