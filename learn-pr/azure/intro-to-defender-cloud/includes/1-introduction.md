Suppose you work for Contoso, an online clothing retailer that is developing a new e-commerce website in order to sell its clothes. Contoso's new clothing website will be made up of several parts, all of which will be hosted in a multicloud environment consisting of Microsoft's Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). There will be backend Linux servers that are used to run the website's application. The website will also require SQL databases to store data.

The clothing retailer will want to ensure that its servers and data are all secure. Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers various plans, that ensure the proper levels of security are in place for the website. For example in this situation, in order to protect the company's website, they would want to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud to protect them from cyberattacks, through the Defender for Servers and Defender for SQL plans.

Some of the protections that will be provided include:

| Type of protections | Benefits |
|--|--|
