## CSPM

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) is a proactive system by which organizations can identify and remediate misconfigurations, threats, misuse and compliance violations across a multicloud infrastructure.

Defender for Cloud uses a secure score to inform you about the state of your overall security posture.
