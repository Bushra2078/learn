Here, we'll discuss how Defender for Cloud works to protect your multicloud environments. You'll learn how to access Defender for Cloud via the Azure portal and use it to strengthen your Secure Score and overall security posture.

## CSPM

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) is a proactive system by which organizations can identify and remediate misconfigurations, threats, misuse and compliance violations across a multicloud infrastructure.

Defender for Cloud uses a Secure Score to tell you about the state of your overall security posture.

The Overview page provides Contoso a birds eye view of their multicloud environments and how secure their systems are. Contoso will be able to review the provided recommendations and have their SOC team remediate them. For example, Contoso will find out if their servers are being protected by firewalls, and if the proper protocols are in place.

Contoso will also be able to review if their required policies and compliance standards are being met and ensure they have all of their regulatory compliance standards in place, such as a PCI-DSS, which is a necessary compliance standard needed when accepting payments online.

Vulnerability assessment is also available and provides alerts and recommendations regarding vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that may exist on your databases or servers.

By following all of the provided recommendations and alerts, you can reduce your attack surface and limit your vulnerabilities from cyberattacks.

## CWP

Cloud workload protection is the reactive part of Defender for Cloud. Defender for Servers will send you alerts informing you about potential cyberattacks such as brute-force attacks. You can also set up automatic protections should Defender for Cloud detect a cyberattack against your environments.

Alerts are generated through Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Advanced Threat Protection functionality. Alerts are available on the Alerts page in Defender for Cloud. The Alerts page informs you via alerts, about possible cyberattacks or potential malicious actions taken against your resources.
