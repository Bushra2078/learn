Remember that your company wants to develop a new e-commerce website in order to sell clothing online. You need to determine which Defender for Cloud plans are the most appropriate to protect your company's resources.

## Decision criteria

When you're choosing which plans to activate you need to consider which resources your company will be using and what regulatory requirements your business may work under. Your companies requirements are:

- Protection for their servers.
- Protection for their databases.
- Remediate issues that may arise.

### Protect your servers

The company's server is where most of its information will be stored. Applications can run off of it and it's susceptible to attacks.

The Defender for Servers plan offer advance threat protection, vulnerability assessment, adaptive network hardening and adaptive application controls.

All of these features will work to strengthen your company's security posture and protect their servers.

### Protect your databases

Each database may contain sensitive information that no company would want exposed to the outside world. some examples could be saved usernames and passwords along with credit card information and home shipping addresses. The databases can also contain information such as profit reports and other important financial information.

The Defender for SQL plan along with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, was designed to protect the following databases:

- SQL
- SQL on machines
- MariaDB
- MySQL
- PostGreSQL
- Cosmos DB

Knowing where your databases are and how best to protect them is always the best way to secure your security posture.

### Remediate issues that arise

Just because you're aware of lapses in your security doesn't always mean you know exactly how to fix them. Even if you do know about potential risk factors and threats against your environments, you'll still need to fix those issues.
