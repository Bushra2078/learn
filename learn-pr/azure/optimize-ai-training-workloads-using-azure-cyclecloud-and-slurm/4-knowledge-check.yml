  questions:
  - content: "What occurs when a node fails node health checks in an Azure CycleCloud cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "The user must resubmit the job."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Resubmitting the job doesn't fix the unhealthy nodes."
    - content: "The user must terminate the cluster and recreate it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Terminating and recreating the cluster isn't necessary as overprovisioning allocates a healthy node to the cluster."
    - content: "Overprovisioning allocates a healthy node to the cluster in place."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The node fails in health checks in a CycleCloud cluster when it's overprovisioned."
  - content: "When can a user run the Node Health Check in an Azure CycleCloud cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "During Slurm cluster creation via the CycleCloud web portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Users can't manually run the NHC during cluster creation as NHC automatically run when new nodes are added to the cluster."
    - content: "After submitting a job to the cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Users can't manually run the NHC after submitting a job to the cluster as NHC  automatically run when new nodes are added to the cluster."  
    - content: "Whenever a node experiences downtime."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Users can't manually run the NHC when nodes are down as NHC automatically run when new nodes are added to the cluster."
    - content: "Node health checks run automatically when new nodes are added to the cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "NHCs can't be run manually and are automatically run when new nodes are added to the cluster when it's enabled during cluster creation."
  - content: "Which Azure service is designed for handling the most demanding, high-performance, low-latency workloads requiring advanced data management capabilities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure files are not suitable for HPC, low latency workloads. They provide cloud-based file storage, allowing users to create and manage file shares accessible over SMB and NFS, suitable for replacing on-premises file servers."
    - content: "Azure NetApp Files (ANF)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Answers B & C both apply."  
    - content: "Azure Managed Lustre File System (AMLFS)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Answers B & C both apply."
    - content: "Azure Blob Storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Blob Storage primarily serves as an object storage solution for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and backups."
    - content: "B & C"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Both ANF and AMLFS are suitable for handling the workloads requiring the advanced data management capabilities."      
  - content: "What are the essential compute requirements for running AI training workloads in an Azure CycleCloud and Slurm environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Distributed training requires a multi-node environment with a minimum of 4 GPUs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To run AI training workloads, it requires multi-node environment with a minimum 4 high performing GPUs."
    - content: "Single-node environments are sufficient for AI training workloads."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "AI Training workloads require multi node environments due to the compute requirements of these workloads."  
    - content: "Premium SSDs aren't necessary for OS disks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Premium SSDs are required for OS disks as they provide low latency solutions for your high performance workloads."
    - content: "InfiniBand connectivity is optional for AI training clusters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "InfiniBand is essential for HPC and AI workloads due to its low latency, high bandwidth, and RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) capability."
  - content: "What are the benefits of choosing a Premium SSD option for your AI training workload?"
    choices:
    - content: "Faster data access and reduced latency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All of the answers A, B, C & D apply to be benefits for choosing a Premium SSD for your AI training workload."
    - content: "Shorter training times and faster model convergence."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All of the answers A, B, C & D apply to be benefits for choosing a Premium SSD for your AI training workload."  
    - content: "Improved scalability and parallelism."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All of the answers A, B, C & D apply to be benefits for choosing a Premium SSD for your AI training workload."
    - content: "Enhanced support for generative AI and large language models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All of the answers A, B, C & D apply to be benefits for choosing a Premium SSD for your AI training workload."
    - content: "All of the Above."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Choosing Premium SSD option enables faster data access, reduced latency with shorter training times, and faster model convergence. It proces improved calability and parallelism with enhanced support for generative AI and LLMs."
