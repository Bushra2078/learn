Your organization needed a recovery strategy for their applications. Your organization was running workloads in the cloud and on-premises. Your organization needed you to select appropriate solutions based on its requirements and keep costs and complexity down.

You developed a business continuity and disaster recovery plan. You used Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup as part of your plan. You then explored how you can build resilience for your applications to ensure they can keep running. You also looked at how you can build resilience for your data that your applications rely on to make sure your applications have access to the data they need.

Imagine if you didn't have a disaster recovery solution in place. Your organization's applications would be continually at risk. Your data would also be at risk. In the event of a failure, your organization would have likely incurred massive costs,  potential legal repercussions, and possible loss of reputation.

By the end of this module, you were able to put together a disaster recovery solution to help keep your organizations' applications running in the event of a failure, whether small or catastrophic. You've learned how to use several Azure tools together as part of your solution to meet your organization's requirements.
