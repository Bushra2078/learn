## Notes from design doc
**Build resilience into your data services**

*   Cosmos DB - with replication in multiple regions
*   SQL Automated backups
*   SQL Server Auto-failover groups
*   SQL Server Always on Availability groups

**Knowledge check**

*   You can't lose any data in your online transactional SQL database, how should you architect its resilience?

    *   Geo-replication ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-designing-cloud-solutions-for-disaster-recovery#scenario-2-azure-regions-for-business-continuity-with-maximum-data-preservation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-designing-cloud-solutions-for-disaster-recovery#scenario-2-azure-regions-for-business-continuity-with-maximum-data-preservation))
*   What are the benefits of moving your data workloads to Cosmos DB now that your online store is moving to multiple regions?
