## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Design you site recovery solution on Azure*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

    You are a solution architect for a retailer and have been tasked with designing your site recovery strategy for your applications. The organization runs a hybrid environment, with some workloads running in the cloud and some remaining on-premises. You need to select the proper solutions to meet your recovery requirements, while keeping costs and complexity down.

## Notes

This module should detail how to design a site recovery solution for your application, and what solutions to use to meet your requirements based on workload. Also needs to consider things like network, PaaS services, secrets and keys, and ops (monitoring, logging). Includes both on-premises and cloud workloads. Due to the breadth of content, this will likely mostly be topical in nature, so we'll want to use case studies and quiz questions for interactivity.
