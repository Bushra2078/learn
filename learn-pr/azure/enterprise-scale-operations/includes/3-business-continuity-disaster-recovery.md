Business continuity and disaster recovery requirements at the application layer will drive platform-level capabilities. These capabilities must be available for consumption by application teams to meet their availability targets and recovery targets. Availability targets are typically measured by service-level objectives (SLO) and service-level agreements (SLA). Recovery targets are typically measured with recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO). These targets should be well understood by central IT and must inform many of the platform-level architectural decisions. A platform that cannot meet application availability targets and recovery targets puts the business at risk.

## High availability

High availability (HA) is the ability to handle the loss or severe degradation of a component of a system. From the platform perspective, ensuring an application team can meet their availability targets means understanding the application's HA patterns and the infrastructure required to implement the patterns. These patterns often include multiregion deployments, Availability Zones, load balancing, distributed consensus, and geo-replication. Key components in the platform design for HA include a network architecture that supports the organization's HA patterns, HA shared services, and region selection.

## Disaster recovery

Disaster recovery (DR) is the ability to recover from high-impact events that result in downtime and data loss. A disaster is a major event with an impact much larger and long-lasting than the application can mitigate through the HA portion of its design.

From the platform perspective, ensuring an application team can meet their recovery targets means understanding the organization's application DR strategies and their supporting infrastructure. Typical DR strategies require multiregion network redundancy, geo-replication, and recovery automation. As with HA, network architecture and region selection are critical. The network design must provide both the redundancy and throughput necessary to support replication requirements and survive disaster scenarios. Region selection must include planning for service availability, data replication, and capacity.
