Operationalizing the Azure estate is critical. It ensures that the organization maintains full visibility and control over the platform. It also provides the business with a secure, unhindered path to the cloud.

For central teams to maintain operational visibility within a large-scale Azure estate, organizations must establish a centralized approach to management and monitoring. We recommend that organizations enforce management and monitoring configurations across the Azure estate. This approach:

- Ensures that there are no unintended gaps in observability.
- Provides application teams with easily consumable management capabilities.
- Gives central teams the ability to enforce controls that are necessary to meet governance and compliance requirements.

To provide a platform that meets application requirements for high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR), you must have a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that application teams use to achieve their goals. The platform team is responsible for connectivity and for guiding region selection for platform-replication capabilities.

A secure Azure estate provides central teams with real-time visibility into changes in the environment. This visibility is critical to meeting governance and compliance requirements. To achieve this goal, use Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel for real-time insights, and use Azure Policy to enforce approved resource configurations.
