Operationalizing the Azure estate is critical to ensuring customers maintain full visibility and control over the platform while providing the business a secure, unhindered path to the cloud.

For central teams to maintain operational visibility within a large-scale Azure estate, a centralized approach to management and monitoring must be established. Organizations should enforce management and monitoring configurations across the Azure estate. This will ensure there are no unintended gaps in observability, will empower the application teams with easily consumable management capabilities, and will provide central teams with the ability to enforce controls necessary to meet governance and compliance requirements.

Providing a platform that meets application requirements for HA and DR requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms used by the application teams to achieve their goals. The platform team will be responsible for connectivity and guiding region selection for platform replication capabilities.

Securing the Azure estate and providing central teams with real time visibility into the changes occurring within the environment are critical to maintaining an environment that meets governance and compliance requirements. Approved resource configurations should be enforced with Azure Policy, and Azure Security Center and Azure Sentinel should be used for real-time insights.

And finally, organizing teams with clearly defined roles and responsibilities will ensure the organization is able strike the right balance between centralized platform control and empowering the business.
