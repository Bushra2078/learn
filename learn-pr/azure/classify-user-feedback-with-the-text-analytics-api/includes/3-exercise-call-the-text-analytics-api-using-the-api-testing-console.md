To see the Text Analytics API in action, let's make some calls using the built-in API testing console tool located in the online reference documentation. Before we do that, we'll need an access key to make those calls.

## Create an access key

Every call to Text Analytics API requires a subscription key. Often called an access key, it is used to validate that you have access to make the call. We'll use the Azure portal to grab a key.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you used to activate the sandbox.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, under **Azure services**, select **Create a resource**. The **Create a resource** pane appears.

1. In the search box, enter *Text Analytics*, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Select **Text Analytics** in the search results. The **Text Analytics** pane appears.

1. Select **Create**. The **Select additional features** pane appears.

1. Select **Continue to create yoru resource**. The **Create** pane appears for *Text Analytics*.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting  | Value  | Description  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    | **Project details**| |
    | Subscription  |  Concierge Subscription  | Subscription under which this new Cognitive Services API account with **Text Analytics API** is created.   |
    |Resource group    |  From the dropdown list, select *<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>*       |  Name for the new resource group in which to create your Cognitive Services Text Analytics API account.       |
    | **Instance details**| |
    |Region     |  From the dropdown list, choose a region close to you. |  Choose a region near you or near other services your functions access.  |
    |Name     |  Enter a unique name for your Cognitive Dervices account.   |  Name of the Cognitive Services account. We recommend using a descriptive name. Valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`. |
    |Pricing tier     | From the dropdown list, select **F0 Free**. |  Cost of your Cognitive Services account depends on the actual usage and the options you choose. We recommend selecting the free tier for our purposes here.      |

    > [!TIP]
    > Remember the location you selected when creating the Text Analytics cognitive services account. You'll use it to make API calls shortly.

1. Select **Review + create** to start the account creation process, and then select **Create**.

    Watch for a notification that the deployment is in progress. You'll then get a notification that the account has been deployed successfully to your resource group.

## Get the access key

Now that we have our Cognitive Services account, let's find the access key so we can start calling the API.

1. Select **Go to resource**. This action opens the Quick start account.

1. In the left menu bar, under **RESOURCE MANAGEMENT**, select **Keys and Endpoint**. The **Keys and Endpoint** pane appears.

1. Copy one of the keys by selecting the *Copy to clipboard* icon at the end of one of the **KEY** fields.

    ![Manage keys user interface showing the name of the Cognitive Services account and the Key 1 and Key 2 entries.](../media/manage-keys.PNG)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Always keep your access keys safe and never share them.

1. Store this key for the rest of this module. We'll use it shortly to make API calls from the testing console and throughout the rest of the module.

## Call the API from the testing console

Now that we have our key, we can head over to the testing console and take the API for a spin.

1. Go to the following URL in your favorite browser. Replace `[location]` with the location you selected when creating the Text Analytics cognitive services account earlier in this unit. For example, if you created the account in *eastus*, you'd replace `[location]` with `eastus` in the URL.

    ```bash
    https://[location].dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0
    ```

    The landing page displays a menu on the left and content to the right. The menu lists the POST methods you can call on the Text Analytics API. These endpoints are **Detect Language**, **Entities**, **Key Phrases**, and **Sentiment**. To call one of these operations, we need to do a few things.

    - Select the method we want to call.
    - Add the access key that we saved earlier in the lesson to each call.

1. From the left menu pane, select **Sentiment**. This selection opens the Sentiment documentation to the right. As the documentation shows, we'll be making a REST call in the following format.  

    `https://[location].api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/sentiment`

     `[location]` is replaced with the location that you selected when you created the Text Analytics account.

    We'll pass in our subscription key, or access key, in the **ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key** header.

## Make some API calls

1. In the **Sentiment** section of this pane, select the button corresponding to the location or region in which you created the Cognitive Services account. Selecting this button opens the live, interactive, API console.

1. Paste the access key you saved earlier into the field labeled **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**. Notice that the key is written automatically into the HTTP request window as a header value.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the pane, and select **Send**.

    Let's examine the sections of this screen in more detail.

    In the Headers section of the user interface, we set the access, or subscription key in the header of our request.

    Next, we have the *Request body* section, which holds a **documents** array. Each document in the array has three properties. The properties are *"language"*, *"id"*, and *"text"*. The *"id"* is a number in this example, but it can be anything you want as long as it's unique in the documents array. In this example, we're also passing in documents written in three different languages. Over 15 languages are supported in the Sentiment feature of the Text Analytics API. For more information, check out [Supported languages in the Text Analytics API](/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/text-analytics-supported-languages). The maximum size of a single document is 5,000 characters, and one request can have up to 1,000 documents.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-marker.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Request Body section." loc-scope="azure-text-analytics":::

    The complete request, including the headers and the request URL appear in the next section. In this example, you can see that the requests are routed to a URL that begins with `westus`. The URL differs depending on the location you selected when you created your Text Analytics account.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-marker.png" alt-text="Screenshot of section number four showing the request URL." loc-scope="azure-text-analytics":::

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-marker.png" alt-text="Screenshot of section number five showing the detailed HTTP request." loc-scope="azure-text-analytics":::

    Next, we have information about the response. In this example, we see that the request was a success and code `200` was returned.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-marker.png" alt-text="Screenshot of section number five showing the response status." loc-scope="azure-text-analytics":::

    Finally, we see the response to our request. The response holds the insight the Text Analytics API had about our documents. An array of documents is returned to us, without the original text. We get back an *"id"* and *"score"* for each document. The API returns a numeric score between 0 and 1. Scores close to 1 indicate positive sentiment, while scores close to 0 indicate negative sentiment. A score of 0.5 indicates the lack of sentiment, a neutral statement. In this example, we have two fairly positive documents and one negative document.

Congratulations! You've made your first call to the Text Analytics API without writing a line of code. Feel free to stay in the console and try out more calls. Here are some suggestions:

- Change the documents in the *Request body* and see what the API returns.
- Try the other methods, **Detect Language**, **Entities**, and **Key Phrases**, using the same subscription key.
- Try to make a call from a different region with your subscription and observe what happens.

The API testing console is a great way to explore the capabilities of this API. Now that you've explored for yourself, let's move on to putting this intelligence into a real-world scenario.
