This exercise takes you through the process of implementing CI/CD of a sample IoT application to Azure IoT Edge. As in the previous exercise, you'll use Azure DevOps Starter for this purpose. However, you'll rely on Azure DevOps to provide the code repository and implement the corresponding CI/CD pipelines.

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise illustrates how to use Azure DevOps Starter (which simplifies the process for implementing CI/CD pipelines considerably). For detailed information regarding authoring pipelines in Azure DevOps and GitHub, refer to the references provided at the end of this module.

In this exercise, you'll:

* Implement an IoT Edge CI/CD pipeline by using Azure DevOps Starter.
* Validate the CI/CD functionality.
* Delete deployed resources.

## Prerequisites

To perform this exercise, you need:

* An Azure subscription.
* A Microsoft account, or an Azure AD account with the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription and with the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription.
* An Azure DevOps organization associated with the Microsoft account or the Azure AD account referenced in the previous prerequisite. To create an Azure DevOps organization, follow the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true).
* At least one concurrent pipeline in your Azure DevOps organization.

> [!NOTE]
> This requirement results from changes to the policy governing free grants of concurrent pipelines to Azure DevOps projects. For more information, refer to [Change in Azure Pipelines Grant for Public Projects](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/change-in-azure-pipelines-grant-for-public-projects/). You'll find there a link to the form that you can use to request the free grant of parallel jobs in Azure Pipelines. The response is expected within 2-3 business days.

## Validate the CI/CD functionality

Now that the GitHub workflow and the corresponding Azure resources are fully deployed, you'll validate the CI/CD functionality.

1. In the **All pipelines > cna-devops-07-iothub - CD** pane, on the menu, select **Repos**, and then in the repository's folder hierarchy, select **edgeSmokeTest.sh**.
1. In the pane displaying the **edgeSmokeTest.sh** file content, select **Edit**.
1. Replace both occurrences of `azure-cli-iot-ext` with `azure-iot`. Add the `# ` string to the front of the line **91** --> `validateDevicesModulesRunning`, and then select **Commit**.
1. In the **Commit** pane, select **Commit** again.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **validateDevicesModulesRunning:** function fails due to an issue with the underlying module. By commenting it out, you'll be able to observe the successful completion of the release pipeline to the **dev** stage. In real-world scenarios, you should troubleshoot the deployed module's status. But for this exercise, the focus is on the CI/CD functionality.

## Delete deployed resources

Your testing of CI/CD by using GitHub workflows is complete. To avoid unnecessary costs associated with the use of Azure resources, you'll now delete the resources you provisioned in this exercise.

1. In the web browser displaying the Azure portal, on the **cna-devops-07-rg** resource group blade, from the toolbar, select **Delete resource group**.
1. In the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** text box, enter the name of the resource group, and then select **Delete**.

## Results

Congratulations! You've completed the third and final exercise of this module. In this exercise, you went through the process of implementing a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys an IoT application to Azure IoT Edge. As in the previous exercise, you used Azure DevOps Starter for this purpose. But this time, you used Azure DevOps to provide the code repository and implement the corresponding CI/CD pipelines. After you completed your testing, you deleted the Azure resources deployed in this exercise to avoid extra charges.
