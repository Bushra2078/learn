This exercise takes you through the process of implementing continuous integration and CI/CD of a sample containerized Node.js web app into an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. You also test this functionality by directly modifying one of the app files to trigger the automatic build and deployment processes.

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise illustrates how to use Azure DevOps Starter (which simplifies the process for implementing CI/CD pipelines considerably). For detailed information regarding authoring pipelines in Azure DevOps and GitHub, refer to the references provided at the end of this module.

In this exercise, you:

- Prepare for deploying Azure resources.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline by using Azure DevOps Starter.
- Validate the CI/CD functionality.
- Delete deployed resources.

## Prerequisites

To perform this exercise, you need:

- An Azure subscription.
- A Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra account. The Global Administrator role in the Microsoft Entra tenant should be associated with the Azure subscription and with the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription.
- An Azure DevOps organization associated with the Microsoft account or the Microsoft Entra account referenced in the previous prerequisite. To create an Azure DevOps organization, refer to the link provided at the end of the module.
- A GitHub account associated with the Microsoft account or the Microsoft Entra account referenced in the previous prerequisite. To create a GitHub account, follow the instructions available at [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

## Prepare for deploying Azure resources

Before you can proceed with deploying Azure resources by using GitHub actions, you need to register the **Microsoft.AlertsManagement** resource provider because the workflow references it during AKS cluster provisioning.

1. If needed, start a web browser.
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in to access the Azure subscription you're using in this module.
1. In the Azure portal, open a **Cloud Shell** Bash session by selecting its icon in the toolbar next to the search text box.
1. Within the Bash session in the Azure Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to register the **Microsoft.AlertsManagement** resource provider.

    ```bash
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.AlertsManagement
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify the registration state of the **Microsoft.AlertsManagement** resource provider.

    ```bash
    az provider show --namespace Microsoft.AlertsManagement --query registrationState
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Wait until the command returns the **Registered** value before you proceed to the next task. If necessary, rerun the command.

## Implement a CI/CD pipeline by using Azure DevOps Starter

Now you're ready to proceed with implementing a CI/CD pipeline by using Azure DevOps Starter.

1. In the web browser displaying the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the beginning of the Azure portal page to search for **DevOps Starter**. From the list of results, in the **Services** section, select **DevOps Starter**.
1. On the **DevOps Starter** menu, select **+ Create**.
1. On the **Start fresh with a new application** tab, verify the presence of the **Setting up DevOps starter with GitHub** label. If the label states **Setting up DevOps starter with Azure DevOps**, select the **here** link, select **GitHub**, and then select **Done**.
1. On the **Start fresh with a new application** page, select the **Node.js** tile, and then select **Next: Framework >**.

## Validate the CI/CD functionality

Now that the GitHub workflow and the corresponding Azure resources are fully deployed, validate the CI/CD functionality.

1. In the web browser displaying the Azure portal, navigate to the **cna-devops-05-rg** resource group.
1. On the **cna-devops-05-rg** blade, select the entry representing the **cna-devops-05** Kubernetes service.

1. On the **cna-devops-05 \| Services and ingresses** blade, in the list of services, select the **sampleapp** entry.
1. On the **sampleapp \| Overview** blade, note the values of the external IP address and the port entries.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The sampleapp listens to incoming HTTP requests on TCP port 8080.

1. Open a new browser window and navigate to the URL, which consists of the `http://` prefix followed by the value of the IP address you identified in the previous step and ending with the `:8080` suffix.
1. Verify that the web browser displays the **Success!** page.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-sampleapp-original.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Success page for the sample web app in its original form." border="false":::

1. After the deployment completes, switch to the browser window displaying the sample web app.
1. Refresh the webpage, and verify that it contains the text **GitHub repository has been successfully updated**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-sampleapp-updated.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the success page with a message that the GitHub repository has been successfully updated." border="false":::

## Delete deployed resources

Your testing of CI/CD by using GitHub workflows is complete. To avoid unnecessary costs associated with using Azure resources, delete the resources you provisioned in this exercise.

1. In the web browser displaying the Azure portal, on the **cna-devops-05-rg** resource group page, select **Delete resource group** on the toolbar.
1. In the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** text box, enter the name of the resource group, and then select **Delete**.
1. Repeat the previous two steps for any other resource groups created during this exercise.

## Results

Congratulations! You completed the second exercise of this module. In this exercise, you went through the process of implementing CI/CD for a sample containerized Node.js web app into an AKS cluster. You also tested this functionality by directly modifying one of the app files to trigger the automatic build and deployment processes. After you completed your testing, you deleted the Azure resources deployed in this exercise to avoid extra charges.
