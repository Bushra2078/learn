Applying DevOps principles to development, deployment, monitoring, and management of cloud-native applications helps you maximize their availability, stability, and performance. You can also enhance their functionality through the expedited delivery of new features.

## Scenario: Set up apps for authentication

Suppose you work for Adatum Corporation, which is a manufacturer of devices such as refrigerators and air-conditioning units. You lead a small development team, and you've been tasked with building a multiple-feature app for smart refrigerators.

Your team has developed a refrigerator inventory service that businesses can use to easily identify what items they need to restock. They can also set up this service to reorder needed items automatically. For this purpose, you used a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster-hosted Node.js app<!-- ID/SME:This is a lot of adjectives in a row, which Acrolinx won't like. Can we break it up? -->. This app processes messages from refrigerators, and then sends them on to a management web app.

In parallel, your team has developed another set of smart refrigerator-related components that collect and process Internet of Things (IoT) telemetry data generated by onboard sensors. The telemetry data allows customers to track the refrigerators' temperatures over time and alert the maintenance staff if an issue occurs. The corresponding IoT pipeline delivers row metrics to Azure Data Lake Storage. Aggregated content is then routed via Azure Event Hubs and Azure Functions to Azure Cosmos DB.

Now your primary challenge is to streamline the build, testing, and deployment of updates. These updates will go to components that constitute your cloud-native application-based solution. Your intention is to adhere to DevOps principles, and use whenever applicable, managed cloud services such as GitHub, Azure DevOps, Azure IoT Hub, AKS, and Application Insights.
