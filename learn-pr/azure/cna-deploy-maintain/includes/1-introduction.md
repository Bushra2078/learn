By applying DevOps principles to the development, deployment, monitoring, and management of cloud-native applications, you can maximize their availability, stability, and performance, while enhancing their functionality through expedited delivery of new features.

## Scenario: Set up apps for authentication

Suppose you work for Adatum Corporation, which is a manufacturer of devices such as refrigerators and air conditioning units. You lead a small development team, and you've been tasked with building a multiple-feature app for smart refrigerators. 

Your team has developed a refrigerator inventory service that businesses can use to easily identify what items they need to restock. They can also set up this service to automatically reorder required items. For this purpose, you used an AKS cluster-hosted Node.js app, which processes messages from refrigerators and sends them to a management web app. 

In parallel, your team has developed another set of smart refrigerator-related components that collect and process IoT telemetry data generated by onboard sensors. The telemetry data allows customers to keep track of the temperature of the refrigerators over time and alert their maintenance staff in case of an issue. The corresponding IoT pipeline delivers row metrics to Azure Data Lake Storage. Aggregated content is routed via Azure Event Hubs and Azure Functions to Cosmos DB. 

Now, your primary challenge is to streamline the build, testing, and deployment of updates to components that constitute your cloud-native application-based solution. Your intention is to adhere to DevOps principles and use, whenever applicable, managed cloud services, such as GitHub, Azure DevOps, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure IoT Hub, and Application Insights.
