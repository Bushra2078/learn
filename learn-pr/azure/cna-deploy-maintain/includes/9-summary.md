You've successfully validated the benefits of Azure DevOps in implementing cloud-native applications. You're confident that this functionality will allow you to further enhance the agility and resiliency of your solution, while increasing its value to customers through more frequent feature updates.

In this module, you learned about the characteristics of CI/CD implemented by using GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines. You started by using GitHub Actions to provision IaC and followed by extending that scenario by incorporating into it the building, testing, and deployment of containerized applications. You also implemented CI/CD for IoT Edge applications by using Azure DevOps.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

* Describe the principles of DevOps and their implementation in cloud-native application scenarios.
* Implement DevOps principles by using GitHub repositories, actions, and workflows.
* Build and deploy infrastructure and applications by using GitHub workflows.
