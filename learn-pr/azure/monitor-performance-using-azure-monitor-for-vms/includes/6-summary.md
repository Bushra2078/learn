In this module, you explored the native Azure monitoring tools and gained a better understanding of how everything fits together from a tooling perspective. You then deployed 2 virtual machines and a Log Analytics workspace. From there, you onboarded both machines to Azure Monitor for VMs.

Next, you explored log queries, which are a great way to drill deeper into log data generated by Azure resources. You learned how to take simple queries and add additional operators that help filter data in a meaningful way. From there, you experimented with a query in the query pane for average CPU usage. Afterward, you edited the existing query to return the maximum CPU usage.

By learning about Azure Monitor Logs and Azure Monitor for VMs, you now have a better understanding on how to help your firm out as they continue to provision resources in Azure.
