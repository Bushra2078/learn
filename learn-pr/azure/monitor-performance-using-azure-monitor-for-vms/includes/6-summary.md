In this module, you explored the native Azure monitoring tools and gained a better understanding of how everything fits together from a tooling perspective. You then deployed two virtual machines and a Log Analytics workspace. From there, you onboarded both machines to Azure Monitor VM Insights.

Next, you explored log queries, which are a great way to drill deeper into log data generated by Azure resources. You learned how to take simple queries and add more operators to help filter data in a meaningful way. From there, you experimented with a query in the query pane for average CPU usage. Afterward, you edited the existing query to return the maximum CPU usage.

By learning about Azure Monitor Logs and Azure Monitor VM Insights, you now have a better understanding of how to help out your firm as it continues to provision resources in Azure.
