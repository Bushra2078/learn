Cloud adoption is a change management exercise. There will be a number of technical decisions and efforts along the way. But the ultimate success of any cloud adoption effort will be defined by the quality of your cloud adoption plan.

In this module, you'll learn how to build rich, data-driven cloud adoption plans.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create an actionable cloud adoption plan
- Understand your digital estate
- Assess the digital estate with Azure Migrate & refine your plan
- Establish a skills readiness plan to prepare the team

## Prerequisites

- Foundational understanding of cloud adoption
- Understanding of your organizationâ€™s adoption strategy and the types of efforts you need to complete
- Basic familiarity with Azure DevOps or other tools used to manage tasks to create a plan
- To complete the hands-on portion of the assessment unit, you will need a functioning version of Azure Migrate with data regarding local servers, applications, and data. If one is not already available, complete [set up Azure Migrate for server migration](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/m365-azure-migrate-set-up/?azure-portal=true) to provide the necessary environment. For project manager roles, you can skip the hands-on tooling section of that unit.
