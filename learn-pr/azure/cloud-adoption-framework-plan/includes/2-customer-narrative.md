We shared the narrative for Tailwind Traders in the Getting Started module and other Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) Learn modules. Specific to this module about planning for cloud adoption, there are two key activities that will drive this module. The central operations and infrastructure team is preparing to migrate a number of workloads to the cloud. The CTO and Developer team are also building out new innovations leveraging data, IoT on the edge, and mobile applications.

## Planning for Tailwind Traders' migration effort

In this module, we will build out a plan for tailwind's migration efforts. Below is an excerpt of the current state environment that will be migrated.

Tailwind Traders currently has three datacenters. One is located within the same office building in which their employees work; the company owns this building and datacenter. The two other datacenters are in separate locations and are leased from datacenter providers. Their datacenters are a mix of physical and virtual servers. The virtualization platforms that they use are a mix between Hyper-V and VMware, as they've had different people with different strategy ideas leading their IT department over the years.

Their servers primarily run Windows Server, with a mix of Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012, and Windows Server 2016. They have only a few Windows Server 2019 instances. Upgrading the operating systems to the latest version or following a consistent strategy has never been a priority for the organization, despite various IT team members trying to push that goal.

There are a few Linux and other open-source servers. The IT operations team isn't familiar with the servers, as the development team has introduced them without collaboration between the teams.

The leases for the two datacenters are due to run out in 18 months and 2 years. The IT manager and finance director have been talking, and they don't want to renew the leases instead looking at doing a project that will upgrade, consolidate, and use the cloud as a replacement datacenter. The new CIO is using this project as an opportunity to rethink IT operations.

## Planning for Tailwind Traders' new innovation effort

Additionally, the Retail Innovation Team will be updating their devops pipelines to deploy new innovative solutions to the cloud. We will use the same migration assessment tools to overcome some documentation challenges amongst the Innovation team's past efforts. We will also use migration tools to test the compatibility of those solutions with basic Azure services. The inventory of data structures, applications, and other services will help to validate the team's devops deployments.

## Building the cloud adoption plan(s)

To keep all of their cloud adoption efforts on track the Tailwind Trader's CIO and Project Managers will create a set of cloud adoption plans to manage their various activities & share progress across the organization.

The exercises in the remaining units of this module will walk through each step of translating the current adoption strategy and future efforts into an actionable cloud adoption plan using the following steps:

1) Prerequisites: Confirm that all prerequisite steps have been completed before you create your plan.
2) Define and prioritize workloads: Prioritize your first 10 workloads to establish an initial adoption backlog.
3) Align assets to workloads: Identify which assets (proposed or existing) are required to support the prioritized workloads.
4) Review rationalization decisions: Review rationalization decisions to refine adoption path decisions: migrate or innovate.

After this module, you may want to also experiment with establishing iterations, release plans, and timelines. A link to that continued learning will be provided in the summary when you complete this module.
