Trial restores are a key component of any disaster recovery strategy.

You want to reassure yourself that you can restore a backed up database to a specific point-in-time should it become necessary. You also want to investigate how long a restore operation will take so that, if the worst happens, you can inform stake holders and manage their expectations correctly. 

Here, you will perform trial restores from automated Azure SQL Database backups.

> [!NOTE]
> The first automatic backup operation must be complete before your can restore a database. Don't start this exercise until 15 minutes or so after you completed the exercise in unit 3.

## Add a new table to the database

Let's start by simulating a mistaken database modification:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), click **All resources** and then click the **sql-erp-db** database.
1. Click **Query editor**, and then sign in with the username **dbadmin** and the password **P4ssw0rd**.
1. To create a new table, in the **Query 1** window, run this command:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Company
    (
        PersonId INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        CompanyName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    )
    ```

1. To check the tables in the database, click **New Query**, and then in the **Query 2** window, run this command:

    ```sql
    SELECT schema_name(t.schema_id) as schema_name,
        t.name as table_name
    FROM sys.tables t
    ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;
    ```

## Run a point-in-time backups

The **Company** table has been mistakenly created. Now, let's restore the database to it's previous state:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), click **All resources** and then click the **sql-erp-db** database.
1. At the top of the **Overview** page, click **Restore**.
1. Complete the **Restore** page with these values, and then click **OK**:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Select source | Point-in-time |
    | Database name | sql-erp-db-restored |
    | Restore point | Select a time ten minutes ago, before you added the **Company** table |
    | Target server | ERPServer |
    | Elastic pool | None |
    | Pricing tier | Default value |
    | | |

## View the restored database

The restored database should not contain the **Company** table. You can check that in the portal:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), click **All resources** and then click the **sql-erp-db-restored** database.
1. Click **Query editor**, and then sign in with the username **dbadmin** and the password **P4ssw0rd**.
1. To check the tables in the database, in the **Query 1** window, run this command:

    ```sql
    SELECT schema_name(t.schema_id) as schema_name,
        t.name as table_name
    FROM sys.tables t
    ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;
    ```
     
1. Examine the results. The **Company** table should not be present.
