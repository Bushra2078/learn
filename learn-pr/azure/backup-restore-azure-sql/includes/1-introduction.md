The data an organization stores in Azure SQL Database is frequently critical and it's often essential to implement a complete backup and restore regime.

Suppose that your retail organization has recently moved their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) database to Azure SQL Database. This database holds critical operational data, and must be protected from data loss or corruption. The company needs to set up backup and retention policies to ensure they have the ability to recover from disasters, and must be familiar with the steps and options to recover, should the need arise.
