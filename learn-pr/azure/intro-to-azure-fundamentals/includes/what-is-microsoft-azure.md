If we decide to scrap the [Core Cloud Services - Introduction to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure/) module in favor of this module, then the answer would be *Yes*. Otherwise, we should still consider it.

## What can I do with Azure?

Azure provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines that run in Azure. While migrating your existing apps to virtual machines is a good start, the cloud is more than just "a different place to run your virtual machines".

For example, Azure provides AI and machine-learning services that can naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing, and speech. It also provides storage solutions that dynamically grow to accommodate massive amounts of data. Azure services enable solutions that are not feasible without the power of the cloud.

The following illustration provides a big-picture view for some of the services and features that are available in Azure.
