Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services range from simple web servies for hosting your business presence in the cloud, to running fully virtualized computers for you to run your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of cloud based services like remote storage, database hosting, centralized account management, and new capabilities like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT).
