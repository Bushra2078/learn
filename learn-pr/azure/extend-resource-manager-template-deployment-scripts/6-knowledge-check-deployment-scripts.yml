    choices:
      - content: "Deployment scripts can access template parameters."

        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Deployment scripts are not associated to Azure Automation or Azure Functions (which are more general ways to execute automation in Azure). A storage account (either pre-existing or created by the deployment scripts resource) is required."
