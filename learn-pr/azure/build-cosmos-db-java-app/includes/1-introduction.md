Imagine you're managing storage for an online retailer. You need tools to create, update, and delete your user and product data.

In this module, you will build a Java console application to create, update, and delete user records and query your data using Java.

We have provided a GitHub repo which you may use as a template for your application.

We will use the Maven package manager to structure our project and pull in dependencies.
