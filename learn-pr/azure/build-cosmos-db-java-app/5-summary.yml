  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "Which of the following are convenient ways to get the URI and master key for your account into your project?"
    choices:
    - content: "The client will infer the connection string when it connects to the server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You must specify the access credentials for you Azure Cosmos DB account."
    - content: "From the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can find the URI and key in the **Keys** blade of the Azure Portal."
    - content: "Using the Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "While this is a good choice, especially since Visual Studio Code has a built-in terminal, it does require knowledge of the required commands. This may not be as convenient as the Visual Studio Code extension."
 
  - content: "When working with Azure Cosmos DB's SQL API, which of these can be used to perform CRUD operations from a Java application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK is designed for the SQL APII."
    - content: "Apache Cassandra client libraries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Apache Cassandra libraries can work with Azure Cosmos DBâ€™s Cassandra API but not with the SQL API."
    - content: "Azure Table Storage libraries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Table Storage libraries can work with Azure Cosmos DB's Table API but not with the SQL API."
 
  - content: "When working with the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK User class, you use a NoSQL model. What is the best way to change the firstName field of a Person Document from 'Ann' to 'Fran'?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call upsertItem with FirstName=Fran"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While the SDK does have an upsertItem method, there is currently not a patch API to update specific fields"
    - content: "Call upsertItem with an updated Person object"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this would work, it isn't the minimum necessary access to meet our requirements. Upsert operations will replace a document if its key already exists or add a new document if not. We don't want to add a new one, so using this method risks introducing subtle, hard to track bugs."
    - content: "Call replaceItem with an updated Person object"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "replaceItem will replace the existing document with the new one. In this case we'd intend the old and new to be the same other than firstName."
