Your role as a mixed reality engineer for a truck manufacturer is to create solutions that support manufacturing logistics. Your company is currently designing a new engine to replace their current production model, and has created a 3D model of the new engine. This model enables the automotive engineering team to view and refine the engine design specifications.

However, viewing the model on a computer screen doesn't allow a full-scale detailed 3D view of the engine and its internal mechanics. An application that provides this capability would help complete a design review of the engine.

In this module, you learn how to create a remote rendering session, load a 3D model into the session, and render the model. You create an Azure Remote Rendering account and session. You load the 3D engine model in Unity and connect your local Unity runtime to the remote session. The model is then available for viewing untethered at full detail.

## Learning objectives

- Create an Azure Remote Rendering session.
- Load a 3D model in Unity.
- Render the 3D model in the remote rendering session.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 version 1903 or higher, or Windows 11. Windows 32-bit versions aren't supported.
- Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later, or Windows 11 SDK.
- Unity 2019.4.X or higher installed, with Unity Hub.
- Visual Studio 2019 or higher with the following workloads installed:
  - .NET desktop development
  - Desktop development with C++
  - Universal Windows Platform (UWP) development with C++ (v142) Universal Windows Platform tools
  - Game development with Unity
- Ideally, some familiarity with C# and Unity scripting and development.
