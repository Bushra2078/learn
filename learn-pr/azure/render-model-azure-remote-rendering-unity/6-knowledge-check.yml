    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: "What is decimation and how does it impact viewing 3D content on untethered devices?"
      choices:
        - content: "Decimation compresses a model and removes textures. Decimated models aren't rendered with full detail."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Decimation doesn't remove model textures."
        - content: "Decimation improves the quality of a model for rendering on an untethered device."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "When a model is decimated, the rendering quality is diminished."
        - content: "Decimation compresses a model and removes polygons. Decimated models aren't rendered with full detail."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Decimation reduces the quality of a model. Therefore, when the model is rendered, it isn't rendered with full detail."
    - content: "How long does a sessionID persist?"
      choices:
        - content: "The sessionID persists for 24 hours."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The sessionID persists for longer than 24 hours."
        - content: "The sessionID persists for 30 days."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The sessionID persists for 30 days. Within those 30 days, the sessionID can be used to query information about the scene."
        - content: "The sessionID persists for 12 months."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The sessionID expires in less than 12 months."
    - content: "How many devices can connect to a session at a time?"
      choices:
        - content: "Only one can connect to a session at a time."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Only a single device may connect to a session at a time. Every Azure Remote Rendering host only serves one client device at a time. As such, when a client connects to a session, it has exclusive control over the rendered content."
        - content: "Up to five devices can connect to a session at a time."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Attempts by multiple to connect will fail."
        - content: "Any number of devices can connect to a session at a time."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Attempts by multiple to connect will fail."
