Architectural patterns for IT solutions are critical to success – a hub and spoke model is just one pattern that exists to help organizations. A hub and spoke consists of a centralized architecture connecting to multiple spokes. The hub and spoke term is derived from the aerospace industry – it's been used for decades as a system to route air traffic. A major airport is a central point (hub) for coordinating air traffic to and from other airports (spokes).

You work for a large insurance organization planning a migration to Azure. Your head office currently hosts all the company's public facing websites and its insure quote app. Your company headquarters and multiple satellite offices around the country will still need to access internal resources that were migrated to Azure, and the back-office area of the quote app. Your VM infrastructure has central dependencies – Azure Active Directory and DNS – that should be accessible.

In this module, you'll look at a hub and spoke topology in Azure that allows for growth and flexibility, planning and designing virtual networks, and how to ensure your architectural design is secure. The final design will provide for isolation of resources, have a low administrative overhead, and allow communication from on-premises resources.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify the requirements and components for a hub and spoke network in Azure.
- Identify the components and limitations for connectivity to on-premises networks.
- Identify methods to secure connectivity in a hub and spoke network.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of networking concepts in traditional and cloud networks.
