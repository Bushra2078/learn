Architectural patterns for IT solutions are critical to success, a hub and spoke model is just one pattern that exists which helps organizations. A hub and spoke consists of a centralized architecture connecting to multiple spokes. The term hub and spoke was derived from the aerospace industry, it's been used for decades as a system to route air traffic. A major airport is a central point (hub) for coordinating air traffic to and from other airports (spokes).

You work for a large organization planning a migration to Azure. You'll need to integrate multiple locations around the country to head office. Your VM infrastructure has central dependencies (AD, DNS, tooling services) that will need to be isolated but still allow other offices access to. Your company also has internet-facing resources, and on-premises connectivity that you need to include in the design.

In this module, you'll look at a hub and spoke topology in Azure that allows for growth and flexibility, planning and designing virtual networks, and how to ensure your architectural design is secure. The final design will provide for isolation of critical resources, have a low administrative overhead, and allow communication with on-premises network resources.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify the requirements and components for a hub and spoke network in Azure
- Identify the components and limitations for connectivity to on-premises networks
- Identify methods to secure connectivity in a hub and spoke network

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of networking concepts in traditional and cloud networks
