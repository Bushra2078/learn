You work for a large insurance organization that's planning a migration to Azure. Your head office currently hosts all the company's public-facing websites and its insurance quote app. Your company headquarters and satellite offices around the country/region will still need to access internal resources that were migrated to Azure, and the back-office area of the quote app. Your virtual machine infrastructure has central dependencies, such as Active Directory and DNS, that should be accessible.

In this module, you'll look at a hub-spoke topology in Azure designed for:

- Growth and flexibility
- Planning and designing virtual networks
- Securing your architectural design

The final design will provide for isolation of resources, have a low administrative overhead, and allow communication from on-premises resources.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify the requirements and components for a hub-spoke network in Azure.
- Identify the components and limitations for connectivity to on-premises networks.
- Identify methods to secure connectivity in a hub-spoke network.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of networking concepts in traditional and cloud networks.
