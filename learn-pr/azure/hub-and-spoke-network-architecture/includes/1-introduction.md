You work for a large insurance organization planning a migration to Azure. Your head office currently hosts all the company's public facing websites and its insurance quote app. Your company headquarters and multiple satellite offices around the country will still need to access internal resources that were migrated to Azure, and the back-office area of the quote app. Your VM infrastructure has central dependencies such as Active Directory and DNS that should be accessible.

In this module, you'll look at a hub and spoke topology in Azure that allows for growth and flexibility, planning and designing virtual networks, and how to ensure your architectural design is secure. The final design will provide for isolation of resources, have a low administrative overhead, and allow communication from on-premises resources.

- Identify the requirements and components for a hub and spoke network in Azure.
- Identify the components and limitations for connectivity to on-premises networks.
