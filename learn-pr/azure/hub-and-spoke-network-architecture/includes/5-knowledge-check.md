## Scenario

Your company is planning a migration of on-premises resources to Azure. As part of this migration, there's a central data center based in your headquarters that will remain on-premises â€“ it will need connectivity to Azure. Your smaller branch offices need to integrate with the headquarters, with central dependencies such as Azure Active Directory and Azure DNS. The goal for the migration is to implement a virtual data center in Azure.
