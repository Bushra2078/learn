In this module, you explored different techniques to log and audit events generated by a Web app. You enabled app logging, ran an instrumented Web app, monitored the live log stream, and retrieved logs from Azure.

App logging provides a quick low-overhead way to see how your app is working, and is useful as you start development of a new Web app.
