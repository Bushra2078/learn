      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The eight principles are independent of application domain, organization size or type, cloud vendor or self-hosted, and programming language or framework."
    - content: "Application domain, Optimization scale or tenant, Cloud vendor or self-hosted, Programming language or framework"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The eight principles are independent of application domain, organization size or type, cloud vendor or self-hosted, and programming language or framework."
    - content: "Application domain, Organization size or type, Cloud vendor or self-hosted, Programming language or framework"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The eight principles are independent of application domain, organization size or type, cloud vendor or self-hosted, and programming language or framework."
  - content: "True or False: to be carbon-efficient is to minimize the amount of carbon emitted per unit of work."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "As discussed under Principle 1: Carbon, the focus of sustainable software engineering is to build applications that are carbon efficient to minimize the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "As discussed under Principle 1: Carbon, the focus of sustainable software engineering is to build applications that are carbon efficient to minimize the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere."
  - content: "What is the single most significant cause of carbon emissions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Agriculture"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Energy supply is the single most significant cause of carbon emission at 29.3% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture is responsible for 11.3% of greenhouse gas emissions."
    - content: "Industry"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Energy supply is the single most significant cause of carbon emission at 29.3% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Industry is responsible for 19% of greenhouse gas emissions."
    - content: "Energy supply"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Energy supply is the single most significant cause of carbon emission at 29.3% of all greenhouse gas emissions."
    - content: "Waste management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Energy supply is the single most significant cause of carbon emission at 29.3% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Waste management is responsible for 3.2% of greenhouse gas emissions."
    - content: "International aviation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Energy supply is the single most significant cause of carbon emission at 29.3% of all greenhouse gas emissions. International aviation is responsible for 3% of greenhouse gas emissions."
  - content: "True or False: reducing the amount of electricity consumed in your application can decrease the carbon intensity of the local grids energy mix."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "From the applications running on your smartphone to the training of machine learning models running in data centers, all software consumes electricity in its execution. One of the best ways to reduce electricity consumption and the subsequent emissions of carbon pollution made by software is to make applications more energy-efficient. Therefore, the second principle of Sustainable Software Engineering is to build applications that are energy-efficient."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
