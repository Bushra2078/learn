Imagine you’re a Java developer, building and deploying applications that will run on on-premises servers. Orchestrating these servers, dependencies, and scale, are all challenging processes. Containerizing applications has many benefits, some of which will alleviate the challenges mentioned above, such as deploying at scale. With Containers, you’ll ensure your applications, and any dependencies, are always isolated in Docker image(s) and ready for on demand deployment and scale.

In this module you’ll first containerize a Java application. For convenience, we’ve selected an existing Java application from the open internet. [Turkish Airlines](https://github.com/chtrembl/Flight-Booking-System-JavaServlets_App), a fully responsive web-based Flight Booking System for Turkish Airlines based on the Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture made using Java Servlets, Java Server Pages (JSPs).

You’ll then construct a Docker file and write the Docker instructions needed to build a Docker image.

You’ll then run the Docker image locally and test the application.

You’ll then push the Docker image into Azure Container Registry and deploy it to Azure Container Registry.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to containerize a Java application, push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry, and then deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service.

You'll use your own Azure subscription to deploy the resources in this module. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/java/?azure-portal=true&WT.mc_id=java-10785-chtrembl) before you begin.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid unnecessary charges in your Azure subscription, remember to deprovision your Azure resources when you finish this module.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Containerize an existing Java application using Docker
- Build a Docker image for the Java application
- Run the Docker image locally
- Push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry
- Deploy the Docker image to Azure Kubernetes Service

## Prerequisites

As a Java developer, you're already familiar with building applications. As you complete the exercises in this module, you'll use a personal Azure account. Make sure that you have the following resources:
  
- An Azure subscription
- Local installations of Java JDK (1.8 or later), Maven (3.0 or later), Docker CLI, Git CLI, and the Azure CLI (2.12 or later)
