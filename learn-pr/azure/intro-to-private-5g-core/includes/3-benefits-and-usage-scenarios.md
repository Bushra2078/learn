Deploying a private mobile network using Azure Private 5G Core at the enterprise edge ensures complete ownership of all data by the enterprise. It also positions the packet core instance as close as possible to the devices it serves, removing any reliance on cloud connectivity. This allows it to deliver low latency levels through local data processing when combined with application logic in the same location. This provides many valuable benefits:

- **Machine to machine automation** - Ultra reliable low latency connectivity (URLLC) for command and control messages from automated systems (like robots or automated guide vehicles). These messages can be processed in real time to prevent stalling, enabling high productivity.
- **Massive IoT telemetry** - Secure cloud connectivity for data collection from a large density and volume of IoT sensors and devices. Data for health assessment and automated systems can be processed in real time to prevent accidents and ensure on-site safety.
- **Real-time analytics** - Local processing of real-time operational and diagnostics data. For example, live video feeds can be processed at the edge at minimal expense using AI, ensuring vital actions aren't delayed.

Azure Private 5G Core is able to leverage this low latency with the security and high bandwidth offered by private 5G networks. This puts it in the optimal position to support Industry 4.0 use cases, such as the following:

- **Manufacturing** - Production-line analytics and warehouse automation with robots.
- **Public safety** - Mobility and connectivity for emergency workers and disaster recovery operatives.
- **Energy and utilities** - Backhaul networks for smart meters and network slicing/control.
- **Defense** - Connected command posts and battlefield with real-time analytics.
- **Smart farms** - Connected equipment for farm operation.
