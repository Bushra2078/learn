Deploying a private mobile network using Azure Private 5G Core at the enterprise edge ensures that the enterprise has complete ownership of all data. It also positions the packet core instance as close as possible to the devices it serves, removing any reliance on cloud connectivity. Additionally, local data processing can ensure low latency levels for IoT applications.

## Key benefits

Azure Private 5G Core provides the following key benefits:

- **Complete 5G core network functions**

  Each *packet core* instance deployed by Azure Private 5G Core is a complete set of 5G network functions. These network functions include the subscriber database, policy control, control plane, and user plane.

  You can also configure packet core instances to operate in 4G mode to support Private Long-Term Evolution (LTE) use cases.

- **Azure service management**
  
  Azure Private 5G Core provides a centralized software lifecycle and service management for the private mobile network across multiple sites. You can use the Azure portal and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) APIs to carry out all management and monitoring tasks.

- **Azure visibility**

  Azure Private 5G Core integrates with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics to collect data from across the sites and provide real-time monitoring of the entire private mobile network.

## Usage scenarios

The following videos introduce several private MEC application scenarios, in which Azure Private 5G Core plays a key role:

TBD: A video that introduces several private MEC application scenarios

As discussed in the video, you can typically use private MEC solutions with Azure Private 5G Core in these areas:

- **Machine to machine automation** - Ultra reliable low latency connectivity (URLLC) for command and control messages from automated systems like robots or automated guide vehicles.
- **Massive IoT telemetry** - Secure cloud connectivity for data collection from a large density and volume of IoT sensors and devices.
- **Real-time analytics** - Local processing of real-time operational and diagnostics data. 

The low latency levels, combined with the security and high bandwidth offered by private 5G networks, put Azure Private 5G Core in the optimal position to support Industry 4.0 use cases, such as the following:

- **Manufacturing** - Production-line analytics and warehouse automation with robots.
- **Public safety** - Mobility and connectivity for emergency workers and disaster recovery operatives.
- **Energy and utilities** - Backhaul networks for smart meters and network slicing/control.
- **Defense** - Connected command posts and battlefield with real-time analytics.
- **Smart farms** - Connected equipment for farm operation.
