Deploying a private mobile network using Azure Private 5G Core at the enterprise edge ensures that the enterprise has complete ownership of all data. It also positions the packet core instance as close as possible to the devices it serves, removing any reliance on cloud connectivity. Additionally, local data processing can ensure low latency levels and reduced backhaul for IoT applications.

## Key benefits

Azure Private 5G Core provides the following key benefits:

- **5G core network functions**

  Each *packet core* instance that Azure Private 5G Core deploys is a set of 5G network functions. These network functions include the subscriber database, policy control, control plane, and user plane.

  You can also configure a packet core instance to operate in 4G mode to support Private Long-Term Evolution (LTE) use cases.

- **Centralized service management**
  
  Azure Private 5G Core provides a centralized software lifecycle and service management for the private mobile network across multiple sites. You can use the Azure portal and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) APIs to carry out provisioning, orchestration, monitoring tasks.

- **Log Analytics integration**

  Azure Private 5G Core integrates with Azure Log Analytics to collect data from all sites and provide comprehensive monitoring and data analytics for the private mobile network. Log Analytics also allows you to collect data from other network elements, such as the RAN or the applications in the data network. With that, you'll be able to monitor the whole solution from a central point.

  Enterprises can use queries to retrieve records and visualize data in charts, either remotely through Azure or locally through other applications.

  Azure Private 5G Core provides proactive, real-time analysis of all message traffic, including NGAP/NAS messages and HTTP requests and responses. With this analysis, you can diagnose many common configuration, network, and interoperability problems affecting relevant services.

The low latency levels, combined with the security and high bandwidth offered by private 5G networks, put Azure Private 5G Core in the optimal position to support Industry 4.0 use cases, such as the following applications:

- **Automation** - Production-line analytics and warehouse automation with robots.
- **Video analytics** - Video analytics for worker safety, airport safety, or drone applications.
- **Remote edge deployments** - Remote private mobile network deployments to remote oil or gas sites.
- **Defense** - Connected command posts and battlefield with real-time analytics.
