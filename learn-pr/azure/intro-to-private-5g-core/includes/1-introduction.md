As Internet of Things (IoT) devices typically need to respond to requests or data changes quickly, they usually require low-latency and high-performance network connectivity. Additionally, many IoT applications in enterprises may have strict data privacy requirements. 

To satisfy the performance and security needs of IoT applications, Azure Private 5G Core offers simple, scalable, and secure deployment of private 5G core networks on an Azure edge platform. While ensuring high performance with local data processing, Azure Private 5G Core also allows you to manage private 5G networks either locally or centrally across global sites through the Azure portal.

Suppose you work in a logistics company, which has sets of cameras installed at different zones in its warehouse. Each camera set performs its own task, such as scanning package labels or monitoring package movement. For example, cameras at zone 1 scan large boxes on conveyor belt 1, cameras at zone 2 scan small boxes taken out from the large boxes on conveyor belts 2, while cameras at zone 3 scan individual items take out from the small boxes on conveyor belt 3. With packages scanned at each step, the company can ensure that all the items are correctly unpacked. They can also use the collected data to assess their unpacking performance.

As the logistics company needs to process incoming/outgoing items continuously, this system requires the data from each camera to be transferred and processed in a fast manner. In addition, as the company may have warehouses at different geographic locations, they may also require the system to be monitored both locally at each site and centrally from the headquarter.

In this case, the company can use Azure Private 5G core to deploy a private mobile network consisting of multiple sites. Azure Private 5G Core ensures high-speed data transfer and processing with 5G bandwidth and local data processing. It also allows the company to monitor its warehouse either locally with packet core dashboards or remotely with Azure Log Analytics. To process data from the cameras, they can deploy computer vision applications together with Azure Private 5G Core.

The following diagram illustrates an example configuration that the warehouse can use:
