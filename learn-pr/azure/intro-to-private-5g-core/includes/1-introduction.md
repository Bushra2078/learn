As Internet of Things (IoT) devices typically need to respond to requests or data changes quickly, they usually require low-latency and high-performance network connectivity. Additionally, many IoT applications in enterprises may have strict data privacy requirements. 

To satisfy the performance and security needs of IoT applications, Azure Private 5G Core offers simple, scalable, and secure deployment of private 5G core networks on an Azure edge platform. While ensuring high performance with local data processing, Azure Private 5G Core allows you to deploy and manage private 5G networks centrally across global sites through the Azure portal. It also allows you to monitor the sites in a private mobile network either remotely with platform metrics or locally with packet core dashboards.

Different from Wi-Fi, the 5G service offered by Azure Private 5G Core overcomes the communication issues caused by noisy radio frequency (RF) environment or large distances.

Suppose you work in a logistics company, which has sets of cameras installed at different packaging zones in its warehouse. At each packaging stage, the cameras scan the labels on the packages. With packages scanned at each step, the company can ensure that all the items are correctly packaged. They can also use the collected data to assess their packaging performance.

As the logistics company needs to process incoming/outgoing items continuously, this system requires the data from each camera to be transferred and processed in a fast manner. In addition, as the company may have warehouses at different geographic locations, they may also require the system to be monitored both locally at each site and centrally from the headquarters.

In this case, the company can use Azure Private 5G core to deploy a private mobile network consisting of multiple sites. Azure Private 5G Core ensures high-speed data transfer and processing with 5G bandwidth and local data processing. It also allows the company to monitor its warehouse either locally with packet core dashboards or remotely with platform metrics. To process data from the cameras, they can deploy computer vision applications together with Azure Private 5G Core.

The following diagram illustrates an example configuration that the warehouse can use:
