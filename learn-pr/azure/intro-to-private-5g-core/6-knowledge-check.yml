  questions:
  - content: "In which of the following situations should Azure Private 5G Core be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "Artificial intelligence support in IoT devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Private 5G Core doesn't provide artificial intelligence functionalities for IoT devices."
    - content: "Mobility and connectivity for disaster recovery operatives."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To recover from disaster and respond to possible emergencies, recovery operatives typically require local mobile network connectivity and fast local data processing. Azure Private 5G Core provides functionalities that satisfy these requirements."
    - content: "Virtual machine provisioning in private networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Enterprises can use Azure Private 5G Core to deploy private mobile networks but can't use it to provision virtual machines in the network."
  - content: "Which of the following features does Azure Private 5G Core provide?"
    choices:
    - content: "Docker-compatible containers to run business logic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Private 5G Core can work together with applications that run business logic but doesn't provide containers for running business logic itself."
    - content: "5G network functions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The packet core instance that Azure Private 5G Core deploys at each site is a complete set of 5G network functions."
    - content: "Threat protection for IoT devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Enterprises can use Azure Private 5G Core to deploy private mobile network that hosts IoT devices. However, Azure Private 5G Core doesn't provide threat protection for each IoT device."
  - content: "How does Azure Private 5G Core provide integration with Azure private multi-access edge compute (MEC) partners?"
    choices:
    - content: "It exposes an N2 and N3 interface respectively for the 5G control plane and user plane."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Private 5G Core complies with 3GPP technical specifications for the N2 and N3 interface, which allows it to be integrated with a wide range of RAN models."
    - content: "It uses a fully managed event-routing service with a publish-subscribe model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Private 5G Core doesn't use any event-routing service for integration."
    - content: "It shares data with other applications through a central database server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Private 5G Core doesn't use any database server to share data."
