Imagine you're a lead web developer at a costume rental company. You launched in one city several months ago and are planning to expand into additional regions. You're developing a new web application to support this expansion and want to understand its behavior under load. You have some basic data from your initial launch and now want to verify that your new application can meet performance targets for peak traffic that you expect based on your initial data.

In this module, you'll learn how to create a load test in the Azure portal, run it and check the results, then customize the test in Azure DevOps.

- Review the gathered performance metrics to understand any performance issues
- Customize and reconfigure tests in Azure DevOps

## Prerequisites

- Understand how to build basic websites
- Know how to navigate resources in the Azure portal
