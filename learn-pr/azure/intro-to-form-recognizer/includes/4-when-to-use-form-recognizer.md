Understanding there may be many scenarios where form analysis is required, we present a few considerations here that offer insight into some applications of Form Recognizer. Using these scenarios, you may come up with other ideas on how you might integrate the Form Recognizer into your applications.

## Bulk Data Extraction

Organizations often receive various types of forms, which can be difficult to parse through and take up valuable time. By extracting the data from forms and combining it with existing operational systems and data storage services, organizations can get insights and deliver value to their customers and business users.

For example, Form Recognizer’s custom model function is being utilized by insurance providers to extract the key data needed without heavy manual intervention, resulting in claims being processed quicker. Being able to integrate into existing systems and add functionality can be vital during disruptive events, such as pandemics, that result both in more claims being lodged and fewer people to go through the forms.

## Integration with Cognitive Search

Many organizations sit on troves of historical data, and Azure Cognitive Search provides a sophisticated, effective way to search for that data. By integrating Form Recognizer with Cognitive Search, it's possible to combine the capabilities of both services - automatically searching, retrieving, and analyzing information that would normally stay hidden within files not easily searched, such as photographs of documents.

This process of retrieving data from file types that would normally require each file to be manually reviewed is known as “knowledge mining”, which you can learn more about in MS Learn Knowledge Mining articles in Unit 7 - Summary.

## Augmenting manual data entry

Many transactional use cases require manual intervention, yet, data entry can be tedious and lead to errors. Form Recognizer can integrate into existing applications and provide a standard JSON response, allowing developers to check manual data entry with Form Recognizer. The standard responses allow simple logic to check if data points from the manual data entry and Form Recognizer are different—for example, if a decimal place was missed during manual data entry. This extra check can help to reduce errors and increase accountability in businesses, like bank loan services to make sure that people aren't getting loans they shouldn’t be, or aren't being denied over small human errors.
