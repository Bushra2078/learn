Form Recognizer is a cognitive service that uses machine learning to automatically read information from images and PDFs. Form Recognizer identifies and extracts data from your documents and organizes the information for you.

Form Recognizer can be integrated into applications, allowing you to enhance existing workflows with unstructured data from paper-based or digital documents. Previously, this functionality would have required manual extraction or a custom machine learning system.

You quickly get accurate results that are tailored to your specific content without heavy manual intervention or extensive data science expertise. Using Form Recognizer allows for quicker, more secure and accurate data extraction.
