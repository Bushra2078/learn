  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What are the characteristics of OLTP workloads?'
    choices:
    - content: "High numbers of transactions with large amounts of data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Analytical workloads tend to have high amounts of data. OLTP workloads have high numbers of transactions, but not large amounts of data."
    - content: "Business intelligence and analytical workloads"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. OLTP workloads tend to be high numbers of transactions, not analytical workloads."
    - content: "Time series data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Time series data is one of many data types usable in OLTP workloads."
    - content: "High numbers of transactions with low amounts of data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. OLTP workloads tend to have low amounts of data, with a high number of transactions, like text messages or purchasing items online."
  - content: 'Why do multi-tenant applications provide massive cost savings?'
    choices:
    - content: "OLAP workloads involve low amounts of data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multi-tenant applications usually have OLTP workloads, with large numbers of tenants."
    - content: "The combined workloads of multiple tenants is low"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multi-tenant applications don't necessarily have low workloads, but the overall workload can be low on average with resources being shared between tenants."
    - content: "Many customers share resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Multi-tenant applications allow for high numbers of users sharing resources, which can provide savings per user."
    - content: "Recent cloud advances in storing large amounts of data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While the cost of cloud storage has fallen, there are other resources other than storage to take into account."
  - content: 'What is a benefit of sharding?'
    choices:
    - content: "OLAP workloads only need to access a single node to run queries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sharding can provide extra performance to OLAP workloads by combining the resources of multiple nodes, which reduces latency."
    - content: "Sharding allows efficient distribution of your data to multiple servers, allowing a level of performance that is impossible to achieve on a single server."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Sharding allows your data to be distributed among nodes, which can leverage more resources than a single node."
    - content: "Queries can be combined into a single, master query."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sharding allows for intelligent distribution of data, not combining queries."
    - content: "Sharding allows applications to directly query worker nodes, removing the need for a coordinator node."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When sharding has distributed data to worker nodes, applications can't directly connect to worker nodes. Queries are routed through the coordinator node."
