Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical design topic in the overall landing zone architecture. Implementing a DNS solution on Azure through virtual machines could require too much effort in comparison with a native solution, running on top of the Azure Platform. 

Azure DNS private resolver bridges on-premesis DNS namespaces with private DNS zones hosted on Azure DNS without the burden of deploying VM-based custom DNS servers. You can resolve DNS queries from on-premesis networks and do conditional forwarding to on-premesis DNS zones.
