<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: state what's in this unit and how it aligns to the 'describe' learning objective.

    Pattern:
        One paragraph of 2-3 sentences:
            Sentence 1: State that this unit addresses ("how it works").
            Sentence 2: State that this unit targets this learning objective: "Describe how (features) of (product) work to (solve problem)."
            Sentence 3-4 (optional): Give the rationale ("helps you decide if it will meet your needs").
        Table-of-contents as a bulleted list (do not simply list every heading you'll have on the page, group them into about 3 high-level areas).

    Heading: none

    Example: "Here, we'll discuss how Logic Apps works behind the scenes. You'll learn about all the pieces of Logic apps and see how they fit together into an app. This knowledge will help you decide whether Logic Apps will work for you without any customization. In cases where you do need to create custom components, you'll be able to determine how difficult it will be.
        * Connectors, triggers, actions
        * Control actions
        * Logic Apps Designer"

Suppose you run all your workloads natively on Azure and register your Virtual Machine DNS records, and Private Endpoint DNS records on Azure Private DNS Zones. Youâ€™ll want to connect from on-prem or VPN and for that you need to be able to resolve the names hosted in Azure Private DNS Zones. 

You would provision Azure DNS Private Resolver on an Azure Virtual Network, provision an inbound endpoint which will have a private IP address from your Virtual Network address space and conditionally forward your queries from on-prem to this IP address. This will enable you to resolve DNS names with a native cloud service. 


<!-- 2. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        Cover the components of (product) and how they work.
        Repeat this pattern multiple times as needed.

    Pattern:
        Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
            1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk.
            2. 1-3 paragraphs of text, with a strong lead sentence in the first paragraph.
            3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote.
