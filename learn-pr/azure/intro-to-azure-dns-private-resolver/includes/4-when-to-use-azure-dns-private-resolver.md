## When to use Azure DNS Private Resolver

Azure DNS private resolver enables users to query Azure DNS private zones from on-prem environment and vice versa without deploying VM based DNS servers. 

Imagine you have hybrid environment where users in on-premises would like to perform a name resolution to connect to the SQL database running in Azure SQL with private endpoint enabled (query Azure private DNS from on-premises). Or an infrastructure running in Azure using Azure private DNS would like to perform name resolution for a service with fqdn running on-premises. 

Azure DNS private resolver enables users to query Azure DNS private zones from on-prem environment and vice versa without deploying VM based DNS servers.
