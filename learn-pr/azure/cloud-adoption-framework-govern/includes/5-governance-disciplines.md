With any cloud platform, there are common governance disciplines that help inform policies and align toolchains. These disciplines guide decisions about the proper level of automation and enforcement of corporate policy across cloud platforms.

## Governance disciplines

The following table summarizes each of the governance disciplines

|  |  |
|--|--|
| <br> ![Cost Management](../_images/govern/cost-management.png) | <br> [Cost Management](./cost-management/index.md): Cost is a primary concern for cloud users. Develop policies for cost control for all cloud platforms. |
| <br> ![Security Baseline](../_images/govern/security-baseline.png) | <br> [Security Baseline](./security-baseline/index.md): Security is a complex subject, unique to each company. Once security requirements are established, cloud governance policies and enforcement apply those requirements across network, data, and asset configurations.|
| <br> ![Identity Baseline](../_images/govern/identity-baseline.png) | <br> [Identity Baseline](./identity-baseline/index.md): Inconsistencies in the application of identity requirements can increase the risk of breach. The Identity Baseline discipline focuses ensuring that identity is consistently applied across cloud adoption efforts. |
| <br> ![Resource Consistency](../_images/govern/resource-consistency.png) | <br> [Resource Consistency](./resource-consistency/index.md): Cloud operations depend on consistent resource configuration. Through governance tooling, resources can be configured consistently to manage risks related to onboarding, drift, discoverability, and recovery. |
| <br> ![Deployment Acceleration](../_images/govern/deployment-acceleration.png) | <br> [Deployment Acceleration](./deployment-acceleration/index.md): Centralization, standardization, and consistency in approaches to deployment and configuration improve governance practices. When provided through cloud-based governance tooling, they create a cloud factor that can accelerate deployment activities. |

## Resource Consistency

Resource consistency focuses on the initial organization of resources required to establish a foundation for governance. Longer term, this discipline focuses on proper on-boarding processes to ensure that all assets meet any operational support requirements.

A subsequent unit in this module will apply this discipline to the early needs of our customer narrative, Tailwind Traders.

## Cost Management

This discipline focuses on scaling the operational best practices for cost management, across all workloads and assets in your portfolio.

A subsequent unit in this module will demonstrate how Tailwind Traders can expand their governance foundation to add cost controls to their governance foundation.

## Security Baseline

This discipline focuses on automating the application of security principles to ensure consistency across your environment.

## Identity Baseline

Once you've established identity and access requirements for your cloud environment, this discipline ensures that those requirements are consistently applied to all workloads and assets.

## Deployment Acceleration

Automation of governance leads to automation in adoption. Providing infrastructure-as-code templates to the various adoption teams, allows them to quickly deploy workloads into compliant, well-managed environments.
