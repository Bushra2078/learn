    - content: Update the existing corporate policy to outline concerns, risks, triggers, and actions.

    - content: Deploy cost management controls and processes.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! In this narrative, the CIO expresses concerns with cost. Addressing those concerns by adding cost management controls will build confidence.
    - content: Deploy security baseline controls and processes.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The CIO added cost risks and concerns to the list, and the existing policy had nothing to do with cost. It's also a message that the CIO shares throughout the narrative.
