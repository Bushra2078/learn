Now that your organization is using Bicep so frequently, they needed to find a way to automate the publishing of reusable Bicep code. You had prepared some Bicep files to deploy security-hardened complete solutions as well as individual components for your colleagues to reuse.

In this module, you learned about the approaches to automate the publishing of template specs and Bicep modules to registries. You learned about the differences between publishing reusable code and deploying regular Bicep files, and you learned how some aspects of deployment workflows can be repurposed for publishing reusable code. You also learned how to consider designing your deployment workflows, and how you can add versioning to your reusable Bicep code from within your workflows.

By automating the publishing of your reusable Bicep code, you can ensure the benefits of automation apply throughout your set of Bicep code. You can also easily modify your reusable Bicep code and have increased confidence that the code is valid and that your organization's processes are followed.
