Before you start to publish your toy company's reusable Bicep code, you need to configure your environment. In this section, you make sure that your Azure and GitHub environments are set up to complete the rest of this module.

To meet these objectives, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up a GitHub repository for this module.
> * Clone the repository to your computer.
> * Create a resource group in Azure.
> * Create a secret in GitHub.

## Get the GitHub repository

Here you make sure that your GitHub repository is set up to complete the rest of this module. You set it up by creating a new repository based on a template repository. The template repository contains the files you need to get started for this module. 

The modules in this learning path are part of a progression. For learning purposes, each module has an associated GitHub template repository.

> [!TIP]
> Even if you completed the previous module in the learning path, please follow these instructions to create a new repository and ensure that you give it a new name.

### Start from the template repository

Run a template that sets up your GitHub repository.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Run the template](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-publish-reusable-bicep-code-using-github-actions?azure-portal=true)

On the GitHub site, follow these steps to create a repository from the template:

1. Select **Use this template**. 

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface showing the template repo, with the 'Use this template' button highlighted.":::

1. Enter a name for your new project, such as *toy-reusable*.

1. Select the **Public** option.

   When you create your own repositories, you might want to make them private. In this module, you'll work with some features of GitHub that only work with public repositories and with GitHub Enterprise accounts.

1. Select **Create repository from template**. 

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-repo-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface showing the repo creation page.":::

[!include[](../../includes/cleanup-steps.md)]

## Clone the repository

You now have a copy of the template repository in your own account. You will now clone this repository locally so you can start work in it. 

1. Select **Code** and select the copy icon.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-github-repository-clipboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface showing the new repository, with the repository U R L copy button highlighted.":::

1. Open Visual Studio Code. 

1. Open a Visual Studio Code terminal window by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal**. The window usually opens at the bottom of the screen.

1. Navigate in the terminal to the directory where you want to clone the GitHub repository on your local computer. For example, to clone the repository to the _toys-reusable_ folder, run the following command:

   ```bash
   cd toys-reusable
   ```

1. Type `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied earlier, which looks something like this:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mygithubuser/toys-reusable.git
   ```

1. Reopen Visual Studio Code in the repository folder by running the following command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```bash
   code -r toys-reusable
   ```

## Sign in to Azure

::: zone pivot="cli"

To work with resource groups in Azure, sign in to your Azure account from the Visual Studio Code terminal. Be sure that you've installed the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?azure-portal=true) tools.

1. To open a Visual Studio Code terminal window, select **Terminal** > **New Terminal**. The window usually opens at the bottom of your screen.

1. If the dropdown control on the right displays **bash**, the correct shell is open and you can skip to the next section.

   :::image type="content" source="../../includes/media/bash.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code terminal window, with bash displayed in the dropdown control.":::

   If **bash** isn't displayed, select the dropdown control, choose **Select Default Shell**, and then select **bash**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../includes/media/select-shell.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code terminal window that displays the dropdown list for selecting a preferred terminal shell.":::

1. In the terminal, select the plus sign (**+**) to create a new terminal with Bash as the shell.

### Sign in to Azure by using the Azure CLI

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, run the following command to sign in to Azure:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

1. In the browser that opens, sign in to your Azure account.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

To work with resource groups in Azure, sign in to your Azure account from the Visual Studio Code terminal. Be sure that you've [installed Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?azure-portal=true).

1. To open a Visual Studio Code terminal window, select **Terminal** > **New Terminal**. The window usually opens at the bottom of your screen.

1. If the dropdown control at the right displays **pwsh** or **PowerShell**, the correct shell is open and you can skip to the next section.

   :::image type="content" source="../../includes/media/pwsh.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code terminal window, with text signifying PowerShell displayed in the dropdown control.":::

   If **pwsh** or **PowerShell** isn't displayed, select the dropdown control, choose **Select Default Shell**, and then select **pwsh** or **PowerShell**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../includes/media/select-shell.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code terminal window that displays the dropdown list for selecting your preferred terminal shell.":::

1. In the terminal, select the plus sign (**+**) to create a new terminal with pwsh or PowerShell as the shell.

### Sign in to Azure by using Azure PowerShell

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, run the following command to sign in to Azure:

   ```azurepowershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

1. In the browser that opens, sign in to your Azure account.

::: zone-end

## Create a resource group in Azure

::: zone pivot="cli"

1. To create a new resource group, run this Azure CLI command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name ToyReusable --location westus
   ```

1. Look at the JSON output from the command. It includes an `id` property, which is the resource group's ID.

   Copy the resource group ID somewhere safe. You'll use it soon.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

1. To create a resource group, run this Azure PowerShell command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```azurepowershell
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name ToyReusable -Location westus
   ```

1. Look at the output from the command. It includes a `ResourceId`, which is the resource group's fully qualified ID.

   Copy the resource group ID somewhere safe. You'll use it soon.

::: zone-end

## Create a service principal and grant it access to the resource group

::: zone pivot="cli"

1. To create a service principal and assign it the Contributor role for your resource group, run the following Azure CLI command in the Visual Studio Code terminal. Replace the `RESOURCE_GROUP_ID` placeholder with the resource group ID you copied in the last step.

   ```azurecli
   az ad sp create-for-rbac \
     --name ToyWebsiteTest \
     --role Contributor \
     --scopes RESOURCE_GROUP_ID \
     --sdk-auth
   ```

   [!INCLUDE [](../../includes/azure-template-bicep-exercise-cli-unique-display-name.md)]

1. Select the JSON output from the previous command. It looks like this:

   ```json
   {
     "clientId": "c6bf233f-d1b8-480a-9cf7-27e2186345d2",
     "clientSecret": "<secret value>",
     "subscriptionId": "f0750bbe-ea75-4ae5-b24d-a92ca601da2c",

   ```

   Copy the entire output somewhere safe, including the curly braces. You'll use it soon. 

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

1. To create a service principal and assign it the Contributor role for your resource group, run the following Azure PowerShell code in the Visual Studio Code terminal. Replace the `RESOURCE_GROUP_ID` placeholder with the resource group ID you copied in the last step.

   ```azurepowershell
   $resourceGroupId = 'RESOURCE_GROUP_ID'

   $azureContext = Get-AzContext
   $servicePrincipal = New-AzADServicePrincipal `
   -DisplayName ToyWebsiteTest `
   -Role Contributor `
   -Scope $resourceGroupId

   $output = @{
      clientId = $($servicePrincipal.ApplicationId)
      clientSecret = $([System.Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', $servicePrincipal.Secret).Password)
      subscriptionId = $($azureContext.Subscription.Id)
      tenantId = $($azureContext.Tenant.Id)
