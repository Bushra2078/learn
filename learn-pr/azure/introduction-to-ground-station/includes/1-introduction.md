Azure Orbital Ground Station provides satellite operators with pay-as-you-go access to a global network of ground stations.

In the past, downlinking data from satellites required expensive upfront investments. But now, with Azure Orbital Ground Station, satellite operators can avoid that up-front investment and create a new business model based on consumption, the OPEX model, rather than upfront costs, the CAPEX model.

This can make space data more accessible and impactful across a wide array of industries.
