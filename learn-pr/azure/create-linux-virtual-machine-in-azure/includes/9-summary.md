In this module, you learned how to create a Linux VM using the Azure portal. You then connected to the public IP address of the VM and managed it with an SSH connection.

You learned that while SSH allows us to interact with the operating system and the software of the virtual machine, the portal will let us configure the virtual hardware and connectivity. We also could've used PowerShell or the Azure CLI if we preferred a command-line or scriptable environment.
