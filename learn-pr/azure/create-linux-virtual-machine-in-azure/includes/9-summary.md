In this module, you learned how to create a Linux VM using the Azure portal. You then connected to the public IP address of the VM and managed it with an SSH connection. 

You learned that while SSH allows us to interact with the operating system and software of the virtual machine, the portal will enable us to configure the virtual hardware and connectivity. We also could have used PowerShell or the Azure CLI, if a command-line or scriptable environment were preferred.

## Clean up resources
 In this module you created resources using your Azure subscription. You want to clean up these resources so that you will not continue to be charged for them.

 1. In Azure, select **Resource groups** on the left.

 1. Find the **learn-create-linux-vm-rg** resource group, or whatever resource group name you used,  and select it.

 1. In the **Overview** tab of the resource group, select **Delete resource group**.

 1. This opens a new dialog box. Type the name of the resource group  again and select **Delete**. This will delete all of the resources we created in this module.
