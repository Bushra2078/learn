  questions:
    - content: "What's the difference between CI and CD?"
      choices:
        - content: "CI is related to integration and testing, and CD is related to packaging and deployment."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. CI is related to the integration of a team's code, and CD is more related to the packaging and deployment of the code."
        - content: "There's no difference between them; CI and CD are two names for the same practice."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Despite small differences, it's possible to have CI without CD and CD without CI. So, they can't be considered the same."
        - content: "CI is related to the people who build the code, and CD is related to tooling."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Both concepts focus on tooling (and both are related only indirectly to people)."
    - content: "What is a CI pipeline?"
      choices:
        - content: "A file that contains instructions for running automated tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The CI pipeline is composed of those files, but it's not the definition of a CI pipeline."
        - content: "The act of running a specific set of automated tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A CI pipeline does run a specific set of tasks, but it's not the definition of a CI pipeline."
        - content: "The set of processes that run when a new code change is detected."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The set of processes that are triggered by a code change is called a pipeline."
