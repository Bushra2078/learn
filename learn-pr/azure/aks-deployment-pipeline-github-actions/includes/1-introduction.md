Imagine that you work for a video production company whose technology stack has migrated to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You want to reduce your development team's time spent on building container images and deploying applications by using pipelines to deploy to AKS. You decide to create a proof of concept by using the company's new website. 

In this module, you learn how to deploy Kubernetes workloads to an AKS cluster by using GitHub Actions.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you can:
- Describe a continuous integration and continuous deployment process that uses GitHub Actions.
- Create a deployment pipeline by using GitHub Actions and Azure.
- Deploy a cloud-native application to AKS by using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

- Your own GitHub account. If you don't already have a GitHub account, create a [free account](https://github.com?azure-portal=true) before you begin.
- Your own Azure subscription. You might incur charges. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) before you begin.
- Familiarity with [Kubernetes concepts](https://azure.microsoft.com/topic/what-is-kubernetes/?azure-portal=true&WT.mc_id=akspipeline_intro-learn-ludossan).
