Now that we have all the understanding about what we need to do, let's start by creating our resources and publish our pipeline.

## Set up the project

1. Fork [this sample repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-deployment-pipeline-github-actions) to your account.

    You're forking the repository so you can create your own GitHub Actions pipeline. This wouldn't be possible if you were using the hosted sample version, because you wouldn't have the correct write access to it.

1. Sign in to Azure Cloud Shell with the account you want to deploy resources into.

    > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
    > [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/?azure-portal=true)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > We'll run all the scripts with Bash, so if you haven't created a Cloud Shell yet, select "Bash" as the running shell.

1. Clone the forked repository by issuing the following command. By the end of the execution you should have a new directory called `mslearn-aks-deployment-pipeline-github-actions`.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/mslearn-aks-deployment-pipeline-github-actions
    ```

1. Enter the newly created directory with `cd mslearn-aks-deployment-pipeline-github-actions`.

1. Execute the `init.sh` file located in the root of the project

    This `init.sh` file will be responsible for:

    1. Set up environment variables `AKS_NAME`, `DNS_NAME`, `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`, and `ACR_NAME`, which are the names given to the resources you'll be creating

    1. Create a new resource group

    1. Create a new AKS Cluster and set up Kubectl to access it

    1. Create a new ACR repository and link it to your AKS cluster

By the end of the execution, the script will give you a list of variables. __Copy and store them__, we'll be using those names in the next steps.

## Check the work

To test if all the resources have been created:

1. Issue `az group list -o table` and check if the resource group listed by the script is shown

1. Issue `az acr list -o table` and check if the ACR the script named is listed
