  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What is a Docker image?"
      choices:
        - content: "A zipped directory with code we can download and run on any platform or computer by using Docker."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Application images are composed of more than just the application code."
        - content: "A standalone, lightweight package that includes all that's needed to run the application in a container."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. An application image is the template that Docker uses to create its containers that hold your application."
        - content: "A snapshot of our current working directory hosted in the cloud."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although an image contains libraries from the OS, an image isn't a snapshot of our computer."

    - content: "What are the main advantages of using a Docker image?"
      choices:
        - content: "Despite being much heavier than standard VMs, Docker images are simpler and faster to deploy."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Images are faster, that's correct. But, they're not heavier than a standard VM, because they don't contain the entire guest OS."
        - content: "The only advantage is that images can be hosted by using container registers, so they're easier to download and run."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Hosting outside the local machine is an advantage, but the option also is possible with standard VMs."
        - content: "Images are smaller and much faster than a VM, and they don't contain useless OS data."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Docker images share libraries with each other through existing containers. They also don't include the entire operating system, which means they're smaller and faster to download and run than a VM."
