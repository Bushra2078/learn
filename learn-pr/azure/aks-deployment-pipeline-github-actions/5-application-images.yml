  questions:
    - content: "What is a Docker Image?"
      choices:
        - content: "It's a zipped directory with code we can download and run in any platform or computer using Docker"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Application images are composed of more than just the application code."
        - content: "It's a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a Docker container"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, an application image is the template Docker uses to create its containers with your application"
        - content: "It's a snapshot of our current working directory hosted in the cloud"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While containing the libraries from the OS, images are not a snapshot of our computer."

    - content: "Why use Docker Images?"
      choices:
        - content: "Because, despite being way heavier than usual VMs, images are simpler and faster to deploy"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Images are faster, that's correct, but they're not heavier than a usual VM because they do not contain the whole guest OS"
        - content: "The only advantage is that images can be hosted using container registers, and thus, are easier to download and run"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Being able to be hosted outside of the local machine is an advantage, but this is also possible with usual VMs"
        - content: "Images are smaller and way faster than a VM and they don't contain useless OS data"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, Docker images share libraries with each other through existing containers, they also don't include the whole operating system, which means they're smaller and faster to download and run than a VM"
