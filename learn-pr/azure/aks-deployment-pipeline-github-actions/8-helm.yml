    - content: "Why is Helm useful in a CI pipeline?"
      choices:
        - content: "We can use Helm charts to provide easier access to our hosted Docker images."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Helm is not used to provide faster or easier access to Docker images."
        - content: "Helm allows us to better version our Kubernetes' manifest YAML files."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This can be done without Helm, too."
        - content: "Because Helm provides several features such as templating which are not present in Kubernetes templates."
