The first step in any learning process is being able to define the core concept in simple terms. In our case, we need to pin down exactly what Mixed Reality means at its most basic level:

*Mixed Reality is a spectrum of immersive experiences, connecting and blending physical and digital worlds together in augmented and virtual reality applications.*

In visual terms, image Mixed Reality as a creative space that exists anywhere between the extremes of the physical and digital world. This can include experiences that overlay virtual content over objects or places in the physical world, like in augmented reality apps, or an entirely immersive virtual experience where the user doesn’t have any input from the real-world, as in VR apps.

Because Mixed Reality covers such a broad range of possible user experiences, it comes with a set of coexisting features that are entirely unique, including but not limited to:

* **Environmental input** – capturing a user’s position in the world, mapping surfaces and boundaries in the area
* **Spatialized sound** – 3D sound that has position and depth in a virtual space, just like in the real-world
* **Locations, positions, and persistence** of objects in real and virtual spaces 

These features are part of a relationship between human and computer input known as human computer interaction, or HCI as it’s referred to in research circles. Human input covers the more familiar ways of interacting with technology, such as using a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, or your own voice. As sensors and processing power has increased in our computers, so too has this new area of computer input from the environment. The interaction between computers and environment is called perception. 

The intersection of computer processing, human input, and environmental understanding is where Mixed Reality lives, where it’s power, creativity, and emerging capabilities comes to life. Movement through the physical world can translate to movement in the digital world. Boundaries in the physical world can influence application experiences, such as game play, in the digital world. Without environmental input, experiences can't blend between physical and digital realities.

As a historical footnote, the term Mixed Realty was introduced in a 1994 paper entitled [A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Displays](https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e77-d_12_1321), written by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino. While not the version of Mixed Reality we have today, their paper did explore the concept of a virtuality continuum and the categorization of taxonomy applied to displays.
