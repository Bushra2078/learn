When you're developing mixed-reality content, you'll likely run into scenarios where you need to store object placement information or render complex 3D models. Or you need to take advantage of cognitive services like speech translation and computer vision. 

## Mixed-reality cloud services

You can use *Azure Remote Rendering* to render highly complex 3D models in real time and stream them directly to a device by moving the rendering workload to high-end GPUs in the cloud. This service is especially important for applications that you might be developing for untethered devices, because they have less computational rendering power.

You can use *Azure Spatial Anchors* to build spatially aware applications. That means you can map, persist, and share holographic content across multiple devices at real-world scale. This service is cross-platform and is uniquely suited to wayfinding, multiuser experiences, and saving your object information.

Microsoft has several *cognitive services* that can be integrated into mixed-reality applications. For example, the Speech service enables the integration of speech-processing capabilities into any app or service. You can convert spoken language into text or produce natural-sounding speech from text by using standard (or customizable) voice fonts.

Another example is the Vision service, which lets your app recognize, identify, caption, index, and moderate your pictures, videos, and digital ink content. It's even possible for your apps to accurately identify and analyze content within an image or video.

## Dynamics 365 mixed-reality applications

The *Dynamics 365 Remote Assist* application allows your users to get help or collaborate efficiently from different physical locations by using HoloLens, HoloLens 2, Android, or iOS devices. This feature is highly valuable in scenarios like maintenance and repair, remote inspections, or training sessions.

*Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides* is a mixed-reality application for Microsoft HoloLens that lets operators learn during the flow of work by providing holographic instructions when and where they're needed. These instruction cards are visually tethered to the place where the work must be done. They can include images, videos, and 3D holographic models.
