In the beginning, computing happened with the creation of mainframe computers: computers that, at times, occupied a whole room. Mainframes were used by large organizations such as NASA for critical applications that process data. Then came the wave of Personal Computers(PC), becoming widely available and connecting people in exponential numbers.

Currently, we have access to a variety of devices that manage data, including IoT sensors and Mixed Reality devices. We have more data than ever before, and leveraging or applying that data through Machine Learning or with Artificial Intelligence has never been more powerful. To be able to process the data and make informed decisions, we need to have access to the data in the right time and right place. In the future, we'll be looking to Mixed Reality to bring that data into our context, real world.

## Common use-cases

- *Design & Prototyping:* Enables real-time collaborative iteration of 3D physical and virtual models across cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- *Training & Development:* Provides instructors with better tools to facilitate teaching/coaching sessions. It offers trainees an enhanced and engaging learning experiences through 3D visualizations and interactivity.
- *Geospatial Planning:* Enables the assessment and planning of indoor and outdoor environments, for instance future construction sites, new store locations, interior designs) and removing the need for manual execution.
- *Sales Assistance:* Improves the effectiveness of individuals in sales-oriented roles by providing tools such as 3D catalogs and virtual product experiences that increase customer engagement and strengthen buyer confidence.
- *Field Service:* Improves the first-visit resolution and customer satisfaction of customer support issues. It is typically used for complex products that would otherwise require a field visit. It can serve as a platform for targeted up-sell opportunities, as well.
- *Productivity & Collaboration:* Transform the space around you into a shared augmented workplace. Remote users can collaborate, search, brainstorm, and share content as if they were in the same room
