When you’re developing Mixed Reality content, there’s a high chance that you’ll run into scenarios where you need to store object placement information, render complex 3D models, or take advantage of cognitive services like speech translation and computer vision. 

Mixed Reality cloud services like **Azure Remote Rendering** and **Azure Spatial Anchors** help developers build compelling immersive experiences on a variety of platforms. These services allow you to integrate spatial awareness into your projects when you're making applications for 3D training, predictive equipment maintenance, and design review, all in the context of your users’ environments.

## Azure Remote Rendering

Azure Remote Rendering lets you render highly complex 3D models in real-time and stream them directly to a device by moving the rendering workload to high-end GPUs in the cloud. This service is especially important for applications that you may be developing for untethered devices, as they have less computational rendering power.

## Azure Spatial Anchors

Azure Spatial Anchors lets you build spatially aware applications, meaning you can map, persist, and share holographic content across multiple devices at real-world scale. This service is cross-platform and is uniquely suited to way-finding, multi-user experiences, and saving your object information.
