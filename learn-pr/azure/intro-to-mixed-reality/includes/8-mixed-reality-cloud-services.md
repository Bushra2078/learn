When you’re developing Mixed Reality content, there’s a high chance that you’ll run into scenarios where you need to store object placement information, render complex 3D models, or take advantage of cognitive services like speech translation and computer vision. 

Mixed Reality cloud services like **Azure Remote Rendering** and **Azure Spatial Anchors** help developers build compelling immersive experiences on a variety of platforms. These services allow you to integrate spatial awareness into your projects when you're making applications for 3D training, predictive equipment maintenance, and design review, all in the context of your users’ environments.

## Azure Remote Rendering

Azure Remote Rendering lets you render highly complex 3D models in real-time and stream them directly to a device by moving the rendering workload to high-end GPUs in the cloud. This service is especially important for applications that you may be developing for untethered devices, as they have less computational rendering power.

## Azure Spatial Anchors

Azure Spatial Anchors lets you build spatially aware applications, meaning you can map, persist, and share holographic content across multiple devices at real-world scale. This service is cross-platform and is uniquely suited to way-finding, multi-user experiences, and saving your object information.

## Cognitive Services

Microsoft has several cognitive services that can be integrated into Mixed Reality applications. For example, the Speech service enables the integration of speech processing capabilities into any app or service. You can convert spoken language into text or produce natural sounding speech from text using standard (or customizable) voice fonts.

Another example is the Vision service, which lets your app recognize, identify, caption, index, and moderate your pictures, videos, and digital ink content. It’s even possible for your apps to accurately identify and analyze content within an image or video.

## Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

Remote Assist is part of the Dynamics 365 product family, allowing your users to get help or collaborate efficiently from different physical locations using HoloLens, HoloLens 2, Android, or iOS devices. This feature is highly valuable in scenarios like maintenance and repair, remote inspections, or training sessions.

## Dynamics 365 Guides

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides is a mixed-reality application for Microsoft HoloLens that lets operators learn during the flow of work by providing holographic instructions when and where they’re needed. These instruction cards are visually tethered to the place where the work must be done, and can include images, videos, and 3D holographic models.
