  questions:
  - content: "What is Mixed Reality?"
    choices:
    - content: "A set of virtual reality hardware devices sold by Microsoft"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual reality hardware devices are only a part of Mixed Reality."
    - content: "A spectrum of immersive experiences, connecting and blending physical and digital worlds together "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Mixed Reality can include experiences that overlay virtual content over objects or places in the physical world, like in augmented reality apps, or an immersive virtual experience where the user doesn’t have any input from the real-world, as in VR apps."
    - content: "An augmented reality platform application that comes with Microsoft HoloLens" 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Mixed Reality is not limited to augmented reality or the Microsoft HoloLens."
  - content: "What is the difference between virtual reality and augmented reality experiences?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual reality fully immerses a user in a digital environment, while augmented reality keeps users in their physical environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Virtual reality users aren't aware of their real-world surroundings, but augmented reality relies on the surrounding environment."
    - content: "Augmented reality fully immerses a user in a digital environment, while virtual reality keeps users in their physical environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Augmented reality applications use the surrounding real-world environment, while virtual reality content is totally immersive."
    - content: "Virtual reality content is only available on holographic devices, while augmented reality content can only run on immersive equipment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual reality content is run on immersive headsets, while augmented reality content is run on holographic devices."
  - content: "How would you describe a hologram?"
    choices:
    - content: "Immersive 3D objects made of opaque pixels."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Holograms are rendered over the real-world and are not opaque."
    - content: "Physical objects that react to digital content."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Holograms are purely digital objects, not physical."
    - content: "Digital objects made of light and sound."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Holograms are digital objects rendered in front of the users view when wearing a HoloLens device."
  - content: "What tool would a design team use to prototype Mixed Reality digital interactions, objects, and UI using crafting materials?"
    choices:
    - content: "Storyboarding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Storyboarding is a 2D design process that is better suited to advertising content to non-technical team members or stakeholders."
    - content: "Whiteboarding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Whiteboarding is a 2D design process that is better suited to non-Mixed Reality prototyping."
    - content: "Bodystorming"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Bodystorming allows you to try out the proposed interactions, features, and mechanics without having to fully prototype them."
  - content: "Mixed Reality exists at the crossroads of which of the following?"
    choices:
    - content: "Humans, computers, and environments."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The intersection of computer processing, human input, and environmental understanding is where Mixed Reality lives, where it’s power, creativity, and emerging capabilities comes to life."
    - content: "Hardware, software, and industry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While hardware, software, and the tech industry are important to Mixed Reality, they are not the core of what makes Mixed Reality possible."
    - content: "Manufacturing, education, and training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Manufacturing, education, and training are common industry use-cases and applications for Mixed Reality."
