Microsoft offers previews of Azure features for evaluation purposes. With *Azure Preview Features*, you can test beta and other pre-release features, products, services, software, and regions.

Some of the common areas you will see previews for include:

- New storage types
- New Azure services, such as Machine Learning enhancements
- New or enhanced integration with other platforms
- New APIs for services

Azure feature previews are available under certain terms and conditions that are specific to each particular Azure preview. Also, some previews are not covered by customer support.

Once a feature has been evaluated and tested successfully, it might be released to customers as part of Azure's default product set. This release is referred to as **General Availability** (GA).

### Feature preview categories

There are two types of previews available:

- **Private Preview**. An Azure feature marked "private preview" is available to *specific* Azure customers for evaluation purposes. This is typically by invite only, and issued directly by the product team responsible for the feature or service.
- **Public Preview**. An Azure feature marked "public preview" is available to *all* Azure customers for evaluation purposes. These previews can be turned on through the preview features page as detailed below.
