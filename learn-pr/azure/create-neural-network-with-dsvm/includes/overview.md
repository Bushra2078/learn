The **Data Science Virtual Machine** for Linux is a virtual-machine image that simplifies getting started with data science. Multiple tools are already built, installed, and configured in order to get you up and running quickly. The NVIDIA GPU driver, NVIDIA CUDA, and NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) library are also included, as are Jupyter and TensorFlow. All pre-installed frameworks are GPU-enabled but work on CPUs as well.

## What is covered in this lab?

 In this lab, you will
* Create a Linux Data Science Virtual Machine in Azure
* Connect to the DSVM via remote desktop
* Train a TensorFlow model to classify images as ones containing hot dogs and ones NOT containing hot dogs
* Use the model in a Python app

In order to complete this lab you will need an Azure subscription and a Xfce remote-desktop client. Please see the prerequisite section for more details. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin, or you can click the `Hands-on Lab` button below to launch the lab on Hands-on Lab site for integrated instruction, we will provide you the necessary resources, including a temporary Azure subscription for the purpose of this lab.
