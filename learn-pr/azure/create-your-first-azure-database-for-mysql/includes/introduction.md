Azure Database for MySQL is a fully managed, scalable MYSQL database service on Azure. It simplifies database deployment, management, and maintenance, while providing compatibility with existing MySQL database workloads.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a large financial services company as a developer, working primarily with LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) software stack-based solutions. You’re developing a web-based app that will utilize MySQL as its data store. You’ve already created a proof-of-concept version that uses an on-premises database server. The company is continuing development, with plans to pilot the app in a few branch offices.
As you continue working on your app, you begin to realize that the existing on-premises database server won’t be able to accommodate the high volume of transactions that you expect the app to generate. You recognize that, to optimize your implementation, the database will need to scale both from the capacity and performance standpoint beyond what's currently available in your local datacenter. You’re also concerned about the resiliency of the current implementation. 
To address these challenges, you’re considering leveraging the public cloud capabilities and deploying MySQL into Microsoft Azure. You want to be able to focus on programming, so you decide to evaluate the Azure Database for MySQL–managed offering, rather than using MySQL on Azure virtual machines (VMs).

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you’ll start by exploring the core functionality of Azure Database for MySQL. You’ll then use this newly acquired knowledge to set up an instance of Azure Database for MySQL and connect to it. 

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to create and connect to an instance of Azure Database for MySQL.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll will learn more about:

- Azure shared disks.
- Using Azure shared disks with virtual machines (VMs).
- Benefits and limitations of Azure shared disks.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure Disk Storage.
- Basic knowledge of Azure VMs.
- Experience using the Azure portal.
