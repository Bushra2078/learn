In the previous module on Azure Container Instances you learnt the basics: how to create containers, define environment variables and mount Azure Files shares and some troubleshooting techniques. In this module you will go one step further, and you will learn some advanced tools that you can use with Azure Container Instances.

With Azure Container Instances you can launch singles containers in Azure, but you can as well leverage advanced functionality to address sophisticated networking and security requirements.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Deploy Azure Container Instances in Azure Virtual Networks
- Configure the Azure Container Instances using YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)
- Include sidecar containers in the YAML definition
- Include initialization containers in the YAML definition
