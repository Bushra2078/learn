  questions:
  - content: 'Where can you build a Custom Commands application?'
    choices:
    - content: "The Cognitive services Speech Software development kit (SDK)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Custom Commands applications can be accessed from the Speech SDK running in an UWP application but cannot be built with just the Speech SDK."
    - content: "The Speech CLI (Command-line interface)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The CLI is built for accessing Speech recognition, speech synthesis, and speech translation services through .bat or shell scripts."
    - content: "The Speech Studio Portal or Windows voice application client"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Custom Command applications can be built quickly using the Speech Studio Portal or Windows voice application."
  - content: 'What can you modify in Custom commands?'
    choices:
    - content: "The timing of the responses by Custom Commands."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can create conditional responses that can react to changes in things like time of day—allowing responses like ‘Good morning’—however, adjusting the time until the system responds is not possible."
    - content: "The Custom Commands response voice"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can choose from over 100 voices for your Custom Commands responses with Custom Voices in the Speech SDK."
    - content: "Actions in response to requests or questions that don't have a defined set of variables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Custom Commands is optimized for voice to actions scenarios and requires well-defined variables for the system to understand and react to. So, asking the assistant the meaning of life may prove fruitless."

    choices:
    - content: "LUIS – Microsoft’s Language Understanding Intelligence Service"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Custom Commands uses LUIS, a cloud-based conversational AI, to understand your commands"
    - content: "Speech-to-text"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Speech-to-text capabilities are used to transcribe your commands to the voice assistant"
    - content: "Text-to-speech"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Text-to-speech capabilities are used to allow the voice assistant to respond to your requests."
