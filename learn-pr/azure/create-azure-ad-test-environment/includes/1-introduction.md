<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: orient the learner to the area covered in this module

    Heading: none

    Example: "Azure Logic Apps let you automate your business processes and run them in the cloud."

    Recommended: visual like an image, table, list, etc. that supports the topic sentence(s)

An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant includes the tenant's users, groups, and apps and is used to perform identity and access management functions for tenant resources.  You can create different tenants and resources to represent different application environments, such as production and test.

<!--TODO: add a visual element -->

<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts

    Heading: "## Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company on the marketing team. You're launching a new basketball shoe created by a celebrity athlete. Previous launches resulted in a social media frenzy as people shared stories and photos of themselves wearing their new shoes. The marketing team wants to monitor hundreds of social media sites, blogs, and websites to determine consumer reaction. There will be more data than you can process manually. You would like a cloud-hosted system that automates monitoring, text analytics, database storage, and email notifications."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario, use the image markdown extension (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/markdown-reference?branch=main#images)

    Optional: a "scenario video" that visualizes the scenario

## Example scenario

Suppose you work on a development team that creates internal apps for a retail company. Your team recently released a sales team dashboard for sales managers to manage their direct reports and help them meet their targets. The initial release of the dashboard app went well, but now management and internal customers are requesting new features and bug fixes in advance of the coming holiday season. You and your team have been manually building, testing, and deploying the web app to Azure App Service.  This process has been labor intensive and is affecting your ability to deliver quality updates on time. The configuration of web app authentication, creation of Azure AD test environments and users, and execution of integration tests have been especially time consuming. You need a CI/CD pipeline that uses an Azure AD test environment to automate the deployment of a web app, the configuration of Azure App Service authentication, and the execution of integration tests as a user.

In this module, your team will set up an Azure AD test environment to help move your web app through the development, test, and production lifecycle.  You'll need an Azure AD tenant which contains app registrations to represent your application and test clients, test users, and optionally policies to protect resources.

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Here, you'll create a business workflow using Azure Logic Apps to automate the processing of tweets:
                * **Launch**: when a new tweet is available
                * **Process**: determine if the sentiment of the tweet is positive or negative
                * **Route**: branch based on the sentiment score"

 -->
## What will we be doing?

In this module, you will:

- Decide whether to use a production Azure AD tenant or a separate tenant for your test environment
- Setup a dedicated test tenant in Azure AD
- Create a test user in the test tenant
- Create an app registration to use as a test client for your web app
- Add policies to the test tenant

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: This is a restatement of the module title into a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to create workflows which route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its built-in connectors."

 -->
## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to setup a test environment in Azure AD for testing Azure applications.
