## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

1. Evaluate whether you need a dedicated test Azure AD tenant or production tenant for your application test environment.
1. Set up a test environment in a separate tenant

1. Introduction

    Suppose you work on a development team that creates internal apps for a retail company. Your team recently released a sales team dashboard for sales managers to manage their direct reports and help them meet their targets. The initial release of the dashboard app went well, but now management and internal customers are requesting new features and bug fixes in advance of the coming holiday season. You and your team have been manually building, testing, and deploying the web app to Azure App Service.  This process has been labor intensive and is affecting your ability to deliver quality updates on time. The configuration of web app authentication, creation of Azure AD test environments and users, and execution of integration tests have been especially time consuming. You need a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of a web app, the configuration of an Azure AD test environment, the configuration of Azure App Service authentication, and the execution of integration tests as users.

    In this module, your team will set up an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) test environment to help move your web app through the development, test, and production lifecycle.  You'll create a separate test tenant which contains app registrations to represent your application and test clients, test users, and optionally policies to protect resources.

1. Plan your Azure Active Directory test environment

    List the content that will enable the learner to complete the subtask:

    - Evaluate whether you need a dedicated test tenant or production Azure AD tenant for your application test environment.
        - Your application uses settings that require tenant-wide uniqueness. For example, your app might need to access tenant resources as itself, not on behalf of a user, by using app-only permissions. App-only access requires admin consent which applies to the entire tenant. Such permissions are hard to scope down safely within a tenant boundary.
        - You have low tolerance of risk for potential unauthorized access of test resources by tenant members.
        - Configuration changes could negatively impact the critical operation of your production environment.
        - You're unable to create users or other test data in your production tenant.
        - Policies are enabled in your production tenant that require user interaction during authentication. For example, if multi-factor authentication is required for all users, you can't use automated sign-ins for integration testing.
        - Adding non-production resources and/or workload to your production tenant would exceed service or throttling limits for the tenant.

1. Exercise - Setup a dedicated test Azure AD tenant

    List the steps that apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Get a test tenant
        1. Join the Microsoft 365 Developer Program (recommended), or
        1. Manually create a tenant
    1. Get an Azure AD subscription (optional)

1. Knowledge check

    What types of questions will test the learning objective? [(Knowledge check guidance)](/help/learn/id-guidance-knowledge-check)

    - (Evaluate) Suppose you have a web application hosted on Azure that signs in users and provides users access to personal medical information.  You need to create or configure a test environment in Azure AD.  Which of the following are good reasons for creating a separate test tenant instead of using your production tenant? 1- You have low tolerance of risk for potential unauthorized access of test resources by tenant members. 2- You can create a tenant for free through the Microsoft 365 Developer Program and can have test user accounts and sample data packs automatically added to the tenant. 3- Policies are enabled in your production tenant that require user interaction during authentication. For example, multi-factor authentication.
    - (Analyze) When creating a separate test tenant in Azure AD, what are some benefits to joining the Microsoft 365 Developer Program instead of manually creating a tenant? 1- It is free and you can have test user accounts and sample data packs automatically added to the tenant. 2- You can only get a free trial of Azure AD Premium1 or Premium 2 licenses through the Microsoft 365 Developer Program. 3-  It includes a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription that you can use to create your own sandbox and develop solutions independent of your production environment.

1. Summary

    Great work!  You've successfully setup a dedicated test tenant in Azure AD.  You've also created a test user and app registrations for test clients. Next, your team will move on to implementing the configuration of Azure App Service authentication for the web app in Azure Pipelines.
