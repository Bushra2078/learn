The Azure Cosmos DB service (`CosmosDbService`) manages querying, creating, deleting, and updating sessions and messages in your AI assistant application. To manage all of these operations, the service is required to implement multiple methods for each potential operation using various features of the .NET SDK.

There are multiple key requirements to tackle in this exercise:

- Implement operations to create a session or message
- Implement queries to retrieve multiple sessions or messages
- Implement an operation to update a single session or batch update multiple messages
- Implement an operation to query and delete multiple related sessions and messages

## Create a session or message

## Retrieve multiple sessions or messages

## Update one or more messages

## Remove a session and all related messages

Now, your application has a full implementation of Azure OpenAI and Azure Cosmos DB. You can test the application end-to-end by debugging the solution.
