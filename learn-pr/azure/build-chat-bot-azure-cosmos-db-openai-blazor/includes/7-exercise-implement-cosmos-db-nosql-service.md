The Azure Cosmos DB service (`CosmosDbService`) manages querying, creating, deleting, and updating sessions and messages in your AI assistant application. To manage all of these operations, the service is required to implement multiple methods for each potential operation using various features of the .NET SDK.

There are multiple key requirements to tackle in this exercise:

- Implement operations to create a session or message
- Implement queries to retrieve multiple sessions or messages
- Implement an operation to update a single session
- Implement an operation to batch update multiple messages
- Implement an operation to query and delete multiple related sessions and messages
