The `CosmosDbService` class contains a stub implementation of a service similar to the `OpenAiService` class you worked on previously in this module. The difference here's that this class uses the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB, which works slightly different.

There are a few key requirements we try to tackle in this exercise:

- Import the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
- Add the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL endpoint and key to the application settings
- Modify the service class with various members and a client instance
