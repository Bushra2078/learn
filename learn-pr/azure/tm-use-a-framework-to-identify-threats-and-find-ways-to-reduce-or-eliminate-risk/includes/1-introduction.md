A threat modeling framework helps you generate a list of potential threats and find ways to reduce or eliminate risk.

Microsoft engineers use the STRIDE framework to find design security issues using the six major threat categories that make up its acronym:

|Category|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Spoofing|Pretending to be someone or something else|
|Tampering|Changing data without authorization|
|Repudiation|Not claiming responsibility for an action taken|
|Information Disclosure|Seeing data without permission|
|Denial of Service|Overwhelming the system|
|Elevation of Privilege|Having permissions I should not have|

In this module, you'll learn about each threat category with their corresponding security controls.

> [!TIP]
> Did You Know? There are many other frameworks you can use to accomplish different goals. Examples include using LINDDUN for privacy threats and attack trees for penetration testing teams to determine how an attack can take place with an "assumed breach" mentality.
