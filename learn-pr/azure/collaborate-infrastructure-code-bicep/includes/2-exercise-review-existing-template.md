You have an existing template that has been working for you so far. It deploys correctly all resources the project needs. You sit down with another team member to talk over the template and some planned changes for the next phase of the project.

As you work your way through the template, your colleague starts to get confused. Maybe your template needs some improvement to help them understand what's happening.

Take a look at the template now, and see how many issues you can spot. You're seeing the template for the first time - do you understand what everything's doing? What could be done to improve the template?

Throughout this module, you'll improve the template to follow best practices and to make it clearer, more understandable, and easier for your colleagues to work with.
