Bicep enables you to collaborate effectively as a team. You can define a clear structure, ensure your infrastructure code is documented, and share it in a version control system.

## Example scenario

Imagine you're working as the Azure administrator in a toy company. You've been asked to help out another team, who is building a website for a new toy. You've worked with Bicep a lot already, so you managed to create a Bicep template and use it to provision all of the resources for the team's website.

So far, you've been working alone, but the project team is growing, and the website is a key part of the team's strategy. You want to ensure new team members can be easily onboarded and can contribute to the project, and even reuse the code for other projects. You've decided to rethink the way you designed, structured, and authored your Bicep code, since you want to enable team collaboration and improve the efficiency of working with the Bicep files.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll be provided with an existing Bicep template that you need to refactor and optimize for team collaboration. You will:

- Break down your Bicep code into reusable modules.
- Define your template structure and authoring style.
- Use comments and other metadata to document your code.
- Enable version control and publish your Bicep code on GitHub.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to author Bicep templates in a way they're modular, reusable, and well documented. You'll also be able to publish your templates on GitHub and enable better collaboration through standard Git-based workflows.

## Prerequisites

- You should have familiarity with creating and deploying Bicep templates.
- You should have some familiarity with Azure, including the Azure portal, subscriptions, resource groups, and resource definitions.
- You should have a basic understanding of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and its benefits.
- You should be familiar with basic concepts and commands of using Git as a distributed version control system (VCS).
- You should have a basic experience with using GitHub.

To follow along with the exercises in the module, you'll need:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed locally.
- The [Bicep extension for Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep) installed.
- GitHub account
- The [Git client](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installed locally
- Either:
  - The latest [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) tools installed locally.
  - The latest version of [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) installed locally.
