The next step is to define the type of organizational structure that best fits your operating model.

The following organizational structures don't necessarily have to map to an organizational chart, or org chart. Org charts generally reflect command and control management structures. Conversely, the following organizational structures are designed to capture alignment of roles and responsibilities. In an agile, matrix organization, these structures might be best represented as virtual teams. There's no limitation suggesting that these organizational structures can't be represented in an org chart. However, it's not necessary to produce an effective operating model.

The first step of managing organizational alignment is to determine how the following organizational structures will be fulfilled:

- **Org chart alignment**: Management hierarchies, manager responsibilities, and staff alignment will align to organizational structures.
- **Virtual teams**: Management structures and org charts remain unchanged. Instead, virtual teams will be created and tasked with the required functions.
- **Mixed model**: More commonly, a mixture of org chart and virtual team alignment will be required to deliver on transformation goals.

## Understand required cloud functions

This list contains the functions required to succeed at cloud adoption and longer-term operating models. After you're familiar with these functions, you can align them to organizational structures based on staffing and maturity.

- [Cloud strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-strategy): A cloud strategy team defines motivations and business outcomes and validates and maintains alignment between business priorities and cloud adoption efforts.
- [Cloud adoption:](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-adoption) Cloud adoption functions enable the implementation of technical solutions in the cloud. Cloud adoption teams are the modern-day equivalent of technical implementation teams or project teams.
- [Cloud governance](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-governance): The cloud governance team ensures that risks and risk tolerance are properly evaluated and managed. The people on this team convert risks into governing corporate policies.
- [Central IT team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it): Adapts existing IT practices to ensure adoption efforts result in well-governed, well-managed environments in the cloud.
- [Cloud operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-operations): An operations team focuses on monitoring, repairing, and remediation of issues related to traditional IT operations and assets.
- [Cloud center of excellence](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence): IT serves as a broker, partner, or representative to the business. This model is a paradigm shift away from the traditional view of IT as an operations unit or abstraction layer between the business and IT assets.
- [Cloud platform](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-platform): Usually provided by a select group of architects who focus on learning about the cloud platform. These architects then aid others in decision making and the proper application of controls to cloud environments.
- [Cloud automation](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-automation): Unlock the potential of DevOps and a cloud-native approach. Expertise in each of these areas can accelerate adoption and innovation.
- [Cloud data](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-data): Multiple audiences involved in managing data and enabling analytics solutions, including the typical seller, database architect, and infrastructure team.
- [Cloud security](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security): The organizational functions required to manage information security risk in an enterprise. These roles and responsibilities form the human portion of an overall cybersecurity system.

To some degree, each of these functions are delivered in every cloud adoption effort. The delivery is either explicit or follows a defined team structure.

As adoption needs grow, so does the need to create balance and structure. To meet those needs, companies often follow a process of maturing organizational structures. The next unit provides more details about each level of maturity.
