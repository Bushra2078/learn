After you align to a certain stage of organizational structure maturity, you can align responsibilities by developing a cross-team matrix that identifies responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) parties. You can read more in the [Align responsibilities across teams](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/raci-alignment) article. 

To track organizational structure decisions over time, you can download and modify the [RACI template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/organize/raci-template.xlsx) and customize it for your organization.
