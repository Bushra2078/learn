title: Use the Cloud Adoption Framework to manage organizational alignment
summary: |
  Moving from an on-premises data center environment to the cloud requires an organization to reevaluate its IT structure. What works on-premises - typically a centralized control model - does not necessarily work in a cloud environment. The good news is, migrating to the cloud can make the job of IT professionals in your organization easier by enabling automation, thereby providing them more freedom to innovate.
  
  The Cloud Adoption Framework provides guidance for this modernization journey by providing an overview of various organizational structures, the pros and cons of different approaches, and a look at how to use a RACI matrix to align accountability and responsibility across each team. This is additional learning recommended to those who have completed the [Accelerate cloud adoption with the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](/learn/paths/cloud-adoption-framework/) learning path.
