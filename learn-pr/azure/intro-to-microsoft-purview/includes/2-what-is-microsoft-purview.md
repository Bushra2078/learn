## What is Microsoft Purview?

Microsoft Purview is a unified data-governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multicloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data. You can easily create a holistic, up-to-date map of your data landscape with automated data discovery, sensitive data classification, and end-to-end data lineage. You can also empower data consumers to find valuable, trustworthy data.

Data Estate Insights, one of the key pillars of Microsoft Purview, offers a bird's eye view into your data catalog, covering these key facets:

* **Asset insights**: A report on the data estate and source type distribution. You can view by source type, classification, and file size. View the insights as a graph or key performance indicators (KPI).
* **Scan insights**: This report provides information on the health of your scans (successes, failures, or canceled).
* **Glossary insights**: A status report on the glossary to help users understand the distribution of glossary terms by status, or to view how the terms are attached to assets.
* **Classification insights**: A report showing where classified data is located. It allows security administrators to understand the types of information found in their organization's data estate.
* **Sensitivity insights**: This report focuses on sensitivity labels that are found during scans. Security administrators can make use of this information to ensure security is appropriate for the data estate.
* **File extension insights**: Detailed reporting on file extensions or file types found during scans. You can use this to understand the number of files of each type that exist. It also indicates where these files are located and if they can be scanned for sensitive information.
