  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You're trying to provision several H-series Azure VMs in the Azure portal to solve some complex financial equations. How can you resolve the errors you are receiving?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Azure Virtual Machines pricing detail page to ensure that the problem you want to solve is supported by the kind of VM you're trying to deploy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These problems are often caused when you reach the limit for VM cores in your subscription. You can't solve them by using the pricing detail page."
    - content: "Tell Azure that your subscription needs to support a greater number of cores than is allowed by default."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Because H-series VMs use large numbers of cores, you can quickly reach the limit for your subscription. Open a support request to increase this limit."
    - content: "Try again at a different time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These problems are often caused when you reach the limit for VM cores in your subscription. You will see the same errors at any later time."
  - content: "You want to deploy an HB-series VM for a weather modeling startup. However, this type of VM doesn't appear as an option in the portal. What should you check?"
    choices:
    - content: "Check that your subscription is allowed to deploy VMs of this type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "HB-series VMs are supported in all Azure subscription. However, they are not supported in all Azure regions."
    - content: "Try again at a different time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The problem is that HB-series VMs are not supported in all Azure regions. This problem will be the same at a different time."
    - content: "Check that this VM is supported in your preferred region of deployment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "HB-series VMs are not supported in all Azure regions."
