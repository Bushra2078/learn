## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    Some companies have complex mathematical tasks that require high performance compute resources. In Azure you can choose from several technologies to perform these tasks.

    Suppose you work for an engineering organization that has an application that creates 3D models of the facilities they design. The company also has another system that stores a large amount of statistical data related to their projects. They want to modernize the aging high performance compute platforms that support these applications, and would like to leverage Azure for their modernization efforts. They need understand the solutions available on Azure and how they can fit into their plans.

    In this module, you will learn about the Azure technologies that you use to execute intensive computing tasks.

    By the end of this module, you will be able to choose the right Azure technology to use for any high performance computing project.

This module will likely not have hands on interactivity outside of knowledge checks, due to the resource requirements and unique use cases for HPC services.
