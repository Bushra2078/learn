## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Introduction to high performance computing (HPC) on Azure*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- |---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    An engineering organization has an application that creates 3d models of facilities they design as well as and another system that has a large amount of statistical data related to their projects that they routinely process. They are looking to modernize their aging high performance compute platforms that support these applications, and would like to leverage Azure for their modernization efforts. They are looking to understand the solutions available on Azure and how they can fit into their plans.

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    2. Step
    3. Step

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

This module will likely not have hands on interactivity outside of quiz, due to the resource requirements and unique use cases for HPC servcies.
