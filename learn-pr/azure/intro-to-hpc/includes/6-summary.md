As companies acquire larger volumes of data and more sophisticated methods to manipulate it, high-performance computing (HPC) becomes more popular. A few years ago, HPC-capable hardware and techniques were beyond the budget and expertise of many organizations. Now, the HPC facilities in Azure put HPC techniques at your fingertips, and empower you to perform new tasks. You've learned about the solutions available on Azure for HPC workloads: Azure Batch, HPC virtual machines, and the Microsoft HPC Pack. You can now choose the best option for your HPC workloads.
