Some organizations have complex mathematical tasks that require high-performance compute resources. In Azure, you have a choice of several technologies to use for these types of tasks.

Suppose you work for an engineering organization that has an application that creates 3D models of the facilities they design. Your organization also has another system that stores a large amount of project-related statistical data. They want to use Azure to modernize the aging high-performance compute platforms that support these applications. Your organization needs to understand the solutions available on Azure, and how they fit into their plans.

In this module, you'll learn about the Azure technologies that you can use to run intensive computing tasks.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to choose the correct Azure technology to use for any high-performance computing project.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify the HPC and batch solutions available on Azure.
- Identify the scenarios where HPC and batch technologies are a fit.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Azure compute services
