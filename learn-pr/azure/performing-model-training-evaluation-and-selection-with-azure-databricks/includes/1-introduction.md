Creating a robust and reliable data model is an important part of data science. A robust data model:

- Performs efficiently based on multiple metrics.
- Can be used for a variety of data set.
- Produces easy to interpret results.

You can train and evaluate your data model using machine learning capabilities of Apache Spark. How you want to use your model depends on your end goal. For example, you can train your machine learning model to analyze historical patterns in a data set and predict future trends.

In this module, we'll look at various techniques for training and evaluating your data model.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Train and evaluate the performance of regression models
- Train and evaluate the performance of classification models
- Perform feature engineering to create new features used when training models
