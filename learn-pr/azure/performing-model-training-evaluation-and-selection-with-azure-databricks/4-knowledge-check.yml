  title: 'Model Training, Evaluation and Selection Quiz'
  questions:
    - content: 'Which of these best describes the purpose of training data?'
      choices:
        - content: A subset of the data used to "test" what the algorithm has learned.
          explanation: This is not the purpose of training data. 
          isCorrect: false
        - content: The dataset used in its entirety to "teach" the algorithm.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Only a subet of the complete dataset should be used for training data. 
        - content: A subset of the data used to "teach" the algorithm. This is the data that the algorithm will learn from.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: This is the best description.   
    - content: 'What is the likely cause when a supervised model makes predictions perfectly against all the training data, but fails against new data.?'
      choices:
        - content: overfitting
          explanation: Overfitting occurs when the model has effectively memorized the answers for the data it has seen, but has not "learned" to make predictions against unseen data. 
          isCorrect: true
        - content: underfitting
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Underfitting would result in bad performance against both training and unseen validation data.
    - content: 'What is used to guide the improvement of the model during model training?'
      choices:
        - content: Plotting the error
          explanation: While plotting the error can be helpful to understanding the model performance, this is not what is ultimately used to perform the model training.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Regression
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is a type of algorithm, not an approach used for model training.
        - content: Minimizing error
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Supervised models use different variants of error calculations during training to find the coefficients that will minimize the error observed between the prediction and the value expected from the training data.
    - content: 'Which of these best summarizes the difference between regression and classification?'
      choices:
        - content: Regression predicts numeric outcomes and classification predicts labels.
          explanation: This is the approach of cross-validation.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Regression predicts a binary outcome.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The output of regression is the prediction of a numeric outcome.
        - content: Classification predicts a binary label.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Classification algorithms can predict binary labels but can also be used to predict multiple labels.
