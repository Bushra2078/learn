The goal of this module was to guide you through the proceoss of building your own Azure Developer CLI templates. You learned how to complete the following tasks:

- Scaffold a new `azd` project using the available starter templates
- Add your own application source code to the template
- Create infrastructure as code files to provision resources for your app
- Define configurations that determine how `azd` deploys your app
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline for the template using the sample workflow files as a starting point

As you continue to build `azd` templates and convert your projects to use this tool you'll become more comfortable with the process. Explore the resources below for additional training and content around building `azd` templates.
