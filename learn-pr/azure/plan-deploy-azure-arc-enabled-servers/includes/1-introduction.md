Azure Arc promises to bridge the gap between on-premises and cloud environments by providing consistent operational approach, agility, automation, and hyperscale of the Azure platform and its services. In this module, you'll learn about planning and securely deploying Arc-enabled servers at scale to realize Azure Arc's capabilities.  

Suppose you are an IT administrator at Wide World Importers, a leading import-export business specializing in trans-Atlantic routes. The company is organized around 6 regional offices based in key port cities. While you work at Headquarters, each regional office has its own IT infrastructure, running unique inventory and logistics software. While some regional offices rely on Azure, others have their own on-premises datacenter and resources in other public clouds.  

Wide World Importers is expanding to 2 new regional offices, each of which will develop its own IT infrastructure. Furthermore, one of Wide World Importer's on-premises datacenters had been targeted by a cyberattack, creating a logistical bottleneck with negative revenue impacts. Facing increasing operational overhead and security vulnerabilities with a fragile IT infrastructure distributed across on-premises and multi-cloud environments, Worldwide Importers is under pressure to ensure improved management of its servers.   

Azure Arc-enabled servers offer Wide World Imports with a single pane of security, governance, and insights across their digital estate, all by extending Azure's management plane. As Wide World Imports is ready to leverage Azure Arc, you are tasked with the testing, planning, and deployment to securely onboard their thousands of servers to Azure Arc.
