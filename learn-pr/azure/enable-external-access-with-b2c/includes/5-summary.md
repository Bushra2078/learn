To protect patients' sensitive health data, you were asked to identify a secure identity solution for the healthcare application.

You learned how you can use Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) to manage patients' access to healthcare applications. You learned how to a tenant for users and an application and register an application with the B2C tenant. To protect how sensitive health data is accessed, you can multi-factor authentication in a user flow. Through multi-factor authentication, you can ensure a second layer of protection is added to the application.

Without Azure AD B2C, it would be harder to manage patients access to the healthcare application. Your application will have reduced protection if you don't use multi-factor authentication with Azure AD B2C. If someone acquired a patient's username or password, their data would be compromised.

Azure AD B2C can remove the complexity of managing user authentication for your application, saving the organization time and money. By enabling multi-factor authentication for the Azure AD B2C application, you can further protect the sensitive data. You've also protected your company's reputation.
