Azure Active Directory business-to-consumer (Azure AD B2C) lets you manage how customers access your applications.

You're the solution architect for a healthcare organization. The organization is publishing an application that allows patients to view their health records. You'll implement a secure identity solution for the application to protect your patients' sensitive health data.

In this module, you'll create an Azure AD B2C tenant, and use it to register an application. You'll use Azure AD B2C's user flows to help manage patient access to the application. You'll also use multi-factor authentication with Azure AD B2C to add a second layer of protection for users.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to use Azure AD B2C with multi-factor authentication to manage and secure access to your application.
