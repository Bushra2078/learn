In this module, you'll learn how to use Azure Active Directory business-to-consumer (Azure AD B2C) to manage how customers access your applications.

You're the solutions architect for a healthcare organization. The organization is publishing an application that patients can use to view their health records. You'll implement a secure identity solution for the application to protect your users' sensitive health data.

In this module, you'll create an Azure AD B2C tenant and use it to register an application. You'll use the user flows in Azure AD B2C to help manage patient access to the application. You'll also use multifactor authentication with Azure AD B2C to add a second layer of protection for users.
