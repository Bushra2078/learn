  - content: Some patients are hard of hearing. You've been asked to ensure that multifactor authentication takes these patients into account. How can you meet this requirement with minimal effort?
    choices:
    - content: Configure multifactor authentication in your application code. Code the app so that users can choose to receive text messages instead of phone calls.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't need to add code to your application to configure multifactor authentication. Instead, use user flows to configure multifactor authentication for your app.
    - content: Configure multifactor authentication in your user flow. Users can then choose to receive a text message instead of a phone call.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Hard-of-hearing users can choose to receive a text-message when they go through the user flow that you've configured.
    - content: Configure multifactor authentication in your page-layout template. Users can choose to receive a text message instead of a phone call.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You use page-layout templates to customize your app's UI. Use user flows to configure multifactor authentication for your app.
  - content: You need to disable multifactor authentication temporarily for your healthcare application. How can you do that?
    choices:
    - content: Delete the user flow and create a new one to disable multifactor authentication.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can go back to your user flow and disable multifactor authentication.
    - content: Pause the user flow and disable multifactor authentication. Then, resume the user flow.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't pause a user flow. You can go back to your user flow and disable multifactor authentication. 
    - content: Go back to your user flow and disable multifactor authentication by using the toggle.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Use the toggle in your user flow to disable multifactor authentication. When you're ready to enable it again, use the toggle once more.
