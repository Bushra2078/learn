## Example scenario

Suppose you work at an organization that currently implements MySQL databases to support critical workloads. The cloud architects and developers at your company spend considerable time with server management. They also frequently troubleshoot issues with the operating systems and databases. You want to migrate to Azure Database for MySQL, which will provide the following benefits:

- High availability
- Automatic backups
- Automated maintenance
- Improved compliance and security

By migrating to Azure Database for MySQL, you can help your cloud architects and developers focus on app development and delivery of those apps and their data to your users.<!-- Acrolinx doesn't like this last sentence - says it's too complex/too long/too many prepositions. -->

## What will we be doing?

You'll assess the Azure Database for MySQL capabilities and determine whether it's a good choice to help manage your workloads. To do this, you'll:

- Identify the Azure Database for MySQL features.
- Assess whether Azure Database for MySQL can help you address your organization's database requirements.
- Determine which Azure Database for MySQL option is best for your organization.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to determine whether Azure Database for MySQL is appropriate for managing your organization's mission-critical workloads. You'll also be able to describe how Azure Database for MySQL performance and scalability make it ideal for hosting your database workloads.<!-- Acrolinx these these two sentences are too formal. I've softened them a bit, but you might want to see if you can soften them even more. -->
