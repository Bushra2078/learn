  title: Create a Windows virtual machine in Azure
  description: |
    Windows Virtual Machines enable you to create dedicated compute resources within Microsoft Azure in minutes that can be used just like a physical desktop or server machine. You can then use Remote Deskop Protocol (RDP) to connect the user interface. Whether your Virtual Machine is a server that you connect to for admistration purposes, or a virtual workstation for an end user, the RDP gives the same experience as sitting at the terminal of a local physical computer.

    In this course, you will learn how to create a Windows VM through the Azure portal. You will then connect to that VM over Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and use the Windows desktop. You will also use the portal to modify the size and networking capabilities of the VM.

summary: In this module, you will learn how to create a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure, then access that virtual machine through a Remote Desktop connection. Finally you will learn to use the portal to modify the virtual hardware configuration of your VM.
