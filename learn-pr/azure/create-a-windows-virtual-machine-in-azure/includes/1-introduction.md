## Motivation

Let's say you work at a company that carries out data processing for road traffic cameras. The video streams are analyzed, categorized, and processed to identify faces and license plates at particular times. This information is then uploaded to Azure Data Lake and a fully searchable index is generated.

These video streams use a range of different codecs and resolutions, you need to run several Windows-based proprietary software packages to carry out the initial processing into a common format. And because different formats keep coming to market, it is better to run these packages on virtual machines that the IT department can start and stop as required.

To administer the encoding software on your Windows virtual machines, you need to be able to connect to the user interface.

In this module, you learn how to create a Windows Virtual Machine and connect to it with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create a Windows Virtual Machine using the Azure Portal
- Connect to a Windows Virtual Machine by using RDP

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of Azure Cloud environment
- Familiarity with virtual machines
