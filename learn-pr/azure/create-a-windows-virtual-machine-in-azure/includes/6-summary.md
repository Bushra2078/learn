## Summary

In this module, you covered how to create a Windows VM by using the Azure Portal. You then connected to the public IP address of that VM and managed it over RDP. You discovered how RDP in Azure provides a similar experience to logging on interactively to a physical computer.

You used the portal to create and modify your VM. You saw that while RDP allows us to interact with the operating system and software of the virtual machine, the portal allows us to configure the virtual hardware and connectivity. We also could have used Powershell or the Azure CLI if we prefer a command line or scriptable environment instead of the portal.
