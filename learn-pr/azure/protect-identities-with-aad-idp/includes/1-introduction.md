Azure Active Directory Identity Protection (AADIP) gives you advanced detection, and remediation, of identity-based risks to protect your Azure AD identities and applications.

You work for a retail organization that has its identities stored in Azure AD. There have been several recent incidents where identities were compromised and sensitive customer information was exposed. You'd like to use Azure native services to protect your company from any future incidents. AADIP will protect your identity infrastructure.

In this module, you'll explore what AADIP is, and how to use it. You'll detect risks with risk policies, then investigate detected risks and remediate them.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to protect your organization's identities from identity-based risks using AADIP.
