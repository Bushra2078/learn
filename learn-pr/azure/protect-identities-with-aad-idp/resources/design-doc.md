## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You work for an organization that has their identities stored in Azure AD. You've recently had several incidents where identities were compromised and sensitive customer information was exposed. You would like to take advantage of Azure native services to protect from these incidents in the future, and believe that Azure AD Identity Protection can provide this for your identity infrastructure.

## Notes

The following doc can be used to simulate risk events. We should be able to do this in sandbox, so try to create this module with an exercise.
