Immersive Reader is an inclusively designed tool that improves reading comprehension by embedding text reading and comprehension capabilities into applications.  As the world becomes more aware of people’s diverse learning needs, software must become more accessible to users. Because of this, Immersive Reader is already built into many applications, such as Word, Outlook, and OneNote.

Immersive Reader is especially beneficial for people with dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, ADHD, autism, visual impairments, sensory processing disorders, and other learning differences because it was designed with the learning needs of dyslexic people in mind. Immersive Reader is proven to increase comprehension and attention. For these reasons, Immersive Reader is being utilized by several online learning services like Discovery Education, Canvas, and MakeCode.
