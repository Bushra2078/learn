Immersive reader is perfect for teaching, both in classrooms and online. This is especially true when many students are learning from home over video conferencing. Immersive Reader helps students from falling behind or growing frustrated with their education, because they can set the pace and environment of their own learning. Overall, creating greater retention and investment in their future.

## Teaching children

Young students require more time and attention than one teacher with 30 students is in a position to provide. Rather than having a teacher read aloud to their students, or relying on parents to fill the gap, students can use Immersive Reader’s read aloud function and follow along to learn how to read and pronounce words at their own pace. Teachers can individualize the learning experience for students, as they have the option to assign reading materials that the student is personally interested in, creating deeper investment in the learning.

Students are capable of becoming independent problem solvers by using the parts of speech and picture dictionary functionality to learn the meaning of words and how sentences are constructed. Through independent learning, teachers are able to mitigate the stigma about being at different learning levels. Overall, resulting in more confident and resilient learners.

## Online learning

In both formal education and through independent online learning tools, such as Code.org, it’s vital that classes are a good learning experience. By implementing Immersive Reader, Code.org has opened up learning to more users, giving users features such as line focus and read aloud to improve attention and comprehension.

## Approaching learning differences

Having a learning difference shouldn’t mean having a subpar education. Immersive Reader was created with dyslexia in mind, however, it’s also designed to help people with ADD—a subcategory of ADHD—autism, dysgraphia—writing dyslexia—and dyscalculia—math dyslexia.

To exemplify, Immersive Reader can help people with dyslexia read by breaking words into syllables. Yet, Immersive Reader can also make maths more accessible for people with dyscalculia by turning on read aloud, or help people with ADHD extend their attention-spans by turning on focus mode. When we create equitable learning environments, we create a higher learner retention among those who are all too often left behind

## Increasing accessibility

Immersive Reader increases accessibility for anyone with visual impairments or sensory processing disorders. These visual difficulties can vary from problems with light sensitivity, trouble with colors, difficulty focusing on a line of text, poor vision, or visual fatigue, which can all make reading on a screen difficult.

Having the option to adjust colors, text size, and font spacing, or listen to the text rather than read it, can make a massive difference in user retention and ease. Further, being free  to put your screen into focus mode, or turn on line focus helps people with processing difficulties not become overwhelmed and frustrated.

## New language learners

Immersive Reader has built-in instant translation to 80 languages, both for a single word or an entire document. Users can also use the picture dictionary with translation for common words, along with read aloud to learn pronunciation of words. This service opens up learning for students who are stronger in different languages. Further, built in translation promotes different language speaking parents involvement in their children's education, which is a vital component to receiving a complete education.
