The threat-modeling framework provides you with a list of threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk. However, it doesn't prioritize them for you. There are also no layered security-control recommendations based on their type and function.

You learned how to determine the priority of your issues and apply the right layer of security controls based on type and function.

In this module, you:

- Learned to prioritize your issues
- Categorized security controls
- Understood each security control type and function
