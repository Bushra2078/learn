After you prioritize each issue, check out the list of security controls and select the options that provide the most benefit for your system.

The most beneficial security controls are found across multiple STRIDE categories. In most cases, they're also relatively inexpensive to implement.

## Security Control Types

As you assess each security control, you'll notice they fall into one of the following types:

|Icon|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|![Physical](../media/Physical.png)|Physical| Controls that physically prevent or detect unauthorized access. Examples include gates, badges, cameras, lighting, and suppression systems|
|![Technical](../media/Technical.png)|Technical| Controls that logically protect your system. Examples include firewalls, antivirus, access control lists, and encryption|
|![Administrative](../media/Administrative.png)|Administrative| Controls referring to policies that define processes for your system. Examples include data classification, auditing, and restrictions|

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your system, you'll want to apply security controls across all types to help create layers for a more secure system.
