The threat modeling exercise helps you find many issues, sometimes way more than you originally expected. The lack of prioritization can leave engineers overwhelmed and unsure of which issues to tackle first.

## I'm Already Overwhelmed. What Should I Do?

The first step is to determine how critical the issue would be to your system. Then, select a mix of security controls that can help provide the most protection at the lowest possible cost.

## Okay. How Do I Determine The Priority?

Security issues are prioritized according to risk severity.

The labels might change from organization to organization. However, they tend to follow a pattern going from critical to low risk impact if the threat was exploited by an attacker.

## And How I Do Know Which Security Control Mixes To Use?

Security controls have different types and functions.

Types can fall into three main categories and are meant to help you look at three different forms of security. Examples include:

- Policies, regulations, and written requirements
- Encryption, virtual firewalls, and antivirus
- Cameras, badges, and fences

Functions are meant to help protect your system against each phase of a potential threat. Examples include:

- Preventing break-ins with locks
- Installing cameras to detect break-ins in process
- Enacting a response plan to correct the break-in
- Repairing the damage caused by the break-in
- Deterring future break-ins with signs and additional security controls

Let's look at priorities, types, and functions in the next few units.
