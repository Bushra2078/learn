The threat modeling exercise helps you find issues, sometimes more than you expected. The lack of prioritization can leave engineers overwhelmed and unsure of which issues to tackle first.

## How to start

First, determine how critical the issue would be to your system. Second, select the security controls that help provide the most protection at the lowest possible cost.

## Determine security issues priority

Security issues are prioritized according to risk severity. The labels might change from organization to organization. However, they tend to follow a pattern from critical to low risk impact if the threat was exploited by an attacker.

## Types and functions

Security controls have different types and functions.

There are three main types that are meant to help you look at three different forms of security.

Examples include:

- Physical: Cameras, badges, and fences
- Technical: Encryption, virtual firewalls, and antivirus
- Administrative: Policies, regulations, and written requirements

Functions are meant to help protect your system against each phase of a potential threat.

Examples include:

- Preventing break-ins with locks
- Installing cameras to detect break-ins in process
- Enacting a response plan to correct the break-in
- Repairing the damage caused by the break-in
- Deterring future break-ins with signs and additional security controls

We'll look at priorities, types, and functions in the next few units.
