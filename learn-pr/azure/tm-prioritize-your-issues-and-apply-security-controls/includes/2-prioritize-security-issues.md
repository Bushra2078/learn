Generate the list of threats with ways to reduce or eliminate risk. Then, work with your colleagues to assign priorities.

The prioritization exercise should follow the internal security bug bar created by your organization.

For reference purposes, the internal bug bar used by engineers at Microsoft looks similar to the table below:

|Severity|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Critical|May cause critical impact for system users. Examples include breaches involving sensitive information disclosure and threats that require privacy and legal involvement|
|Important|May cause serious impact for system users. Examples include rendering a system unusable with no known workarounds|
|Moderate|May cause moderate impact for system users. Examples include availability issues with possible workarounds|
|Low|May cause low impact for system users|
|Information|Potential threat has been considered, evaluated, and deemed not relevant|
