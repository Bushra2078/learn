## What It's About

The threat modeling framework helps you generate a list of threats and ways to reduce risk, but it doesn't prioritize them for you.

Also, it doesn't recommend layered security controls based on their type and function, which makes it harder to decide which ones to implement.

Prioritizing issues is an important piece of threat modeling because it allows you to allocate resources to the most critical issues.

It also helps you decide where to start given your limited resources. Examples include:

- Having to choose between implementing a feature to log all administrative actions or using SSL/TLS to encrypt traffic
- Deciding whether to implement access control lists or strengthen the input validation process for your system first

## When To Use Them

Prioritize each issue according to their risk factors.

Also, select security controls that work in conjunction with others to help provide a layered security protection mechanism for your system.

## What To Expect

This process can take some time. It will also require assistance from your colleagues and security team. Allocate enough time to work with them.
