In addition to its three main types, security controls also have five different functions to help you apply multiple layers of security.

|Function|Description|Example|
|--------|-----------|-------|
|Preventative|Does this strategy help reduce the probability or impact of this threat?|Locks, firewalls, data classification|
|Detective|Does this strategy help identify attacks against my system as they happen?|Surveillance, honeypots, audit logs|
|Corrective|Does this strategy help control how I respond to an incoming attack?|Physical repair, system patches, incident response plans|
|Recovery|Does this mitigation help my service recover from an attack?|Hot-sites, system Backups, disaster recovery plan|
|Deterrent|Does this mitigation help keep attackers away from my system?|Fences, least privilege, authorized use policy|

> [!TIP]
> Depending on issue priority, you may want to consider multiple security control functions to secure your system before, during and after a potential breach.

Together with the security control types, they create a matrix that helps you make the right selections:
