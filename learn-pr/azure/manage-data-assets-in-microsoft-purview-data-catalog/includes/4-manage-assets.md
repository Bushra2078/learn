1. What is an asset?

Why important to manage the lifecycle?

We'll discuss the lifecycle of an asset and in the excercise, we'll show you how to manage assets.

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that will be solved by the content in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "In the shoe-company scenario, we will use a Twitter trigger to launch our app when tweets containing our product name are available."
-->
TODO: add your scenario sub-task

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what's covered in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will learn the policy factors that are controlled by a storage account so you can decide how many accounts you need."
-->
TODO: write your prose table-of-contents

<!-- 4. Visual element (highly recommended) ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Visual element, like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote. Ideally, you'll provide an image that illustrates the customer problem the unit will solve; it can use the scenario to do this or stay generic (i.e. not address the scenario).

    Heading: none
-->
TODO: add a visual element

<!-- 5. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to perform this sub-task.

    Structure: Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. 1-3 paragraphs of text
        3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote.
