In this excercise, we'll edit, certify, move, and delete some assets!

## Edit assets

You can edit assets both individually and in bulk. We'll do both in this example.

### Individual

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), open your Microsoft Purview account and select **Open Microsoft Purview Governance Portal**.

1. The Microsoft Purview Governance Portal opens automatically to the home page of the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog.

1. Search for one of your data assets. If you completed the 'Deploy Microsoft Purview and Scan ADLS Gen 2' excercise before this one, and uploaded the dataset, you can use the same one as we're using in our example. We searched for the keyword 'country' and will select the **Queries by Country** asset.

### Bulk

Individual and bulk

## Asset certification

## Moving an asset
