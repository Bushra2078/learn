### The Microsoft Purview Data Catalog is one of two main pillars in Microsoft Purview that sits atop the Microsoft Purview Data Map. 
### The data map scans resources, and houses metadata about the assets in those resources. 
### The data catalog allows your users to browse those assets fo data they might need based on what kind of data it is, if it's sensitive, or even based on an aspect of your business. 
### The data catalog helps to demistify your data estate so users can find the information they need, without sacrificing security, 
### and while allowing you to curate your experience to match your business.
