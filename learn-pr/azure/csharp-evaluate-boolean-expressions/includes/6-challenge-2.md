Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

## Complicated Permissions Challenge

In this challenge, you'll implement business rules that restrict access to users based on their permissions and their level.  You'll display a different message to the user depending on their permissions and level.

### Step 1 - Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise.

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor then select the `del` or backspace key to delete it.

### Step 2: Add code as a starting point

The following code is sample data that you'll use to test your Boolean expression logic.

```csharp-interactive
string permission = "Admin|Manager";
int level = 53;
```

You may need to use additional data to sufficiently test all of the scenarios described in Step 3, below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the `Contains()` helper method of a string to determine whether the `permission` varaible's value contains one of the permission values you'll be checking for in the "business rules".  Example: `permission.Contains("Admin")` would return `true`. 

### Step 3 - Implement business rules

**Business Rules**

1. If the user is an Admin with a level greater than 55, output the message:

```output
Welcome, Super Admin user.
```

2. If the user is an Admin with a level less than or equal to 55, output the message:

```output
Welcome, Admin user.
```

3. If the user is a Manager with a level 20 or greater, output the message:

```output
Contact an Admin for access.
```

4. If the user is a Manager with a level less than 20, output the message:

```output
You do not have sufficient privileges.
```

5. If the user is not an Admin or a Manager, output the message:

```output
You do not have sufficient privileges.
```

### Step 4 - Make sure you get the output given the sample data

When you run the code, including the sample data from step 2, you should see the following output:

```output
Welcome, Admin user.
```
