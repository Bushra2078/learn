Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

## Heads or tails challenge

In this challenge, you'll flip a coin to display either `heads` or `tails`.  This is a perfect scenario for the conditional operator.

### Step 1 - Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor then select the `del` or backspace key to delete it.

### Step 2 - Write code in the .NET Editor to display the result of a coin flip

Use the `Random` class to generate a value.  Based on the value, use the conditional operator to display either `heads` or `tails`.  

There should be a 50% chance that the result is either heads or tails.

You should be able to accomplish the desired result in three lines of code or less.
