  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Our company wants to keep track of our warehouse inventory.  Which variable data type should be used to store the count of items on hand for each product?"
    choices:
    - content: "string"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If the count of items in our inventory were stored in a string, we would not be able to easily add or subtract items."
    - content: "bool"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Since bool only represents true or false, we could only keep track of whether we had some items or no items.  That may not be useful."
    - content: "float"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's possible to use the float data type for this purpose since it stores numbers.  However, we do not need to store fractional numbers of items in our inventory."
    - content: "int"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  We would need to add items and subtract items as our inventory changes.  The int data type is the best data type for this data."
  - content: 'What is wrong with this line of code?  `Console.WriteLine("What is wrong with me?")`'
    choices:
    - content: "The `L` in `WriteLine` should be lower-case."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `L` should be upper case."
    - content: "It's missing a semi-colon at the end"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  The semi-colon must be used at the end of a code statement."
    - content: "The string should use single-quotes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A string literal must be surrounded in double-quotes.  A char literal is surrounded in single quotes."
    - content: "A comma should be used instead of a dot between `Console` and `WriteLine`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The dot is the member access operator and allows you to access the methods of a class."
  - content: "Which of the following variables names should be avoided."
    choices:
    - content: "$DATA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `$` cannot be used in a variable name.  Furthermore, you should not use all upper case characters for a variable name."    
    - content: "registrationComplete"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a valid variable name."
    - content: "flag"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a valid variable name."
    - content: "yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Admittedly, this is not a great variable name however it is valid."
