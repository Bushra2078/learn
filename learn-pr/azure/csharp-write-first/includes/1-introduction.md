The C# programming language allows you to build many types of applications, from business applications to analyze and process data, dynamic web applications, games, financial or scientific applications, cloud-based applications, mobile applications, and more.

Before you can write a functional novel, you must learn the alphabet and vocabulary.  You then learn sentence structure, forming paragraphs and how to evoke emotion through wording choices.  You finally learn how to develop characters and a story arch with plot points.  Similarly, before you can build entire applications with C#, you'll begin with small foundational concepts.  This module 

By far, the best way to learn how to code is to write code.  You can type along with this module, writing dozens of lines of code.  You'll write code to:

- display messages containing lots of different types of data to a console window
- diagnose errors in your code
- create variables to store data
- concatenate textual data
- add numeric data
- add notes to your code

... and more.

By the end of this module, you'll feel like you've accomplished a lot in a short amount of time and will have a great foundation to build on.
