The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```csharp-interactive
Console.WriteLine("This is the first line.");

Console.WriteLine("This is ");
Console.WriteLine("the second ");
Console.WriteLine("line.");
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because we didn't specify which technique to apply to which line of output.  However, you should have used both the `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.Write()` methods to produce the output.

```output
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
```

If you did it on your own, congratulations!  Continue on to the next unit.

If you got stuck, maybe you should review the previous units before you continue on.  All new ideas we discuss in other modules will depend on your understanding of the ideas that were presented in this module.
