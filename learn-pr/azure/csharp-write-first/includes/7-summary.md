Our goal was to write code that would display simple messages to an output console, and in doing so, become familiar with the syntax.  Using basic C# syntax, we were learned two techniques for displaying literal string data to the console.  We learned what to look for when we come across an error in our code.  We learned about classes and methods and the purpose of several special symbols that are known as operators.

Congratulations to taking your first steps to building more sophisticated applications.  If you're following the learning path, continue on to the next module: "Store and retrieve data using literal and variable values in C#".
