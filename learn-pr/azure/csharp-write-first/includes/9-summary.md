You've covered many foundational concepts in a short time.  You now have written your first lines of C# to print messages to an output console and should understand how to diagnose errors in your code.  You have experience working with several important data types.  You worked with both literal data and variables.  You can perform operations on your data like concatenation and addition.  You learned how to add code comments and what is and is not important in terms of how your code is formatted.

The next steps are:

- Learn how to explicitly convert one data type into a different data type
- Learn how to perform more operations on data
- Learn how to change the flow of control using decision branching and looping statements
- Learn how to 

Assuming you're following this learning path in a linear way, we'll cover all of these topics in upcoming modules.
