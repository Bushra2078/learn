In this module, you'll examine some of the logging capabilities available for ASP.NET web applications. Logging is an important feature of most commercial production systems. A well-designed logging approach captures data that supports debugging production problems, usage tracking, and threat identification.

The scenario used by this module revolves around an existing .NET Framework web application that runs on-premises. You'll start by migrating this application to Azure App Service. Next, you'll configure the Log4Net framework to store log data from the application in Azure Blob storage. Finally, you'll test the logging capability, and push the log information into Application Insights, enabling you to capture custom telemetry.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain why logging is important in a commercial web application, and the role of logging frameworks, in recording application activity
- Implement logging in an ASP.NET web application, to store log data in Azure Blob storage, and incorporate log information in Application Insights performance data
