In this module, you'll examine some of the logging capabilities that are available for ASP.NET web applications. Logging is an important feature of most commercial production systems. A well-designed logging approach captures data that supports debugging production problems, usage tracking, and threat identification.

The scenario in this module features an existing .NET Framework web application that runs on-premises. You'll start by migrating this application to Azure App Service. Next, you'll configure the Log4Net framework to store log data from the application in Azure Blob storage. Finally, you'll test the logging capability, and then push the log information into Azure Application Insights to capture custom telemetry.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain why logging is important in a commercial web application and the role of logging frameworks in recording application activity.
- Implement logging in an ASP.NET web application to store log data in Azure Blob storage and incorporate log information into Application Insights performance data.
