Blazor enables C# developers to leverage their existing skills to build client web applications with C# and .NET.

Commonly, companies building web applications hire developers for a variety of roles: some create the backend server-side logic, and others may build  client-side web app. Often, these developers use different development languages and technologies.

C# & .NET is popular choice for building server-side logic but client side apps are often built using web UI frameworks, commonly using JavaScript. This means these two teams have very different skill sets, and code to transfer and represent data needs to be built in both languages and kept in sync.

Blazor allows developers to build front and backend logic for web apps with a common development language, frameworks and tools. This can accelerate app development, reduce the complexity of the build pipeline, simplify maintenance, and enable developers to understand and work on both the client and server-side code.

Blazor WebAssembly can be used to build web apps that execute on the client browser and can be configured to run offline as a Progressive Web Application.
