  title: Check your knowledge
  questions: 
  - content: "Suppose you want to increase the availability of your system to provide a better service-level agreement (SLA) to your customers. Which of the following is a guiding principle you can use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reduce your target for maximum duration of acceptable data loss."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This can increase recoverability, not availability."
    - content: "Encrypt all data at rest"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This can increase security, not availability."
    - content: "Eliminate single point of failure"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Reliability focuses on maintaining service despite temporary conditions and localized failures. Adding redundancy to eliminate single points of failure is a core strategy for improving availability."
  - content: 'Which of the following would be affected by your defined recovery point objective (RPO)?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The frequency of database backups'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Because the recovery point objective is concerned with the amount of data loss that's tolerable, the frequency of backups needs to be within this time window and is directly affected by your defined RPO.'
    - content: 'The number of regions that data is replicated to'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The number of regions that data is replicated to is an important consideration, but it's not affected by your defined RPO.'
    - content: 'The number of instances in a database cluster'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The number of instances in a database cluster can be an important decision, but it's not affected by your defined RPO.'
    - content: 'The type of load-balancing technology used in your application'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The type of load-balancing technology used in your application can be an important decision, but it's not affected by your defined RPO.'
