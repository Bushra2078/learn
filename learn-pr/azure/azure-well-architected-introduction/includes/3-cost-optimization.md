Your organization has moved a majority of their systems to the cloud, but are now seeing cost increases in areas they didn't expect. After some observation, you realize you're inefficient across your environment, and are still doing manual operational work.

Here, we'll take a look at cost optimization and some ways to eliminate waste and improve operational efficiencies.

## What is cost optimization?

Cost optimization is ensuring that the money your organization spends is being used to maximum effect. Cloud services provide computing as a utility. Technologies in the cloud are provided under a service model, to be consumed on demand. This on-demand service offering drives a fundamental change that directly impacts planning, bookkeeping, and organization.

When an organization decides to own infrastructure, it buys equipment that goes onto the balance sheet as assets. Because a capital investment was made, accountants categorize this transaction as a capital expense (CapEx). Over time, to account for the assets' limited useful lifespan, assets are depreciated or amortized. Cloud services, on the other hand, are categorized as an operating expense (OpEx), because of their consumption model. Under this scheme, there is no asset to amortize. Instead, OpEx has direct impact on net profit, taxable income, and the associated expenses on the balance sheet.

When an organization adopts a cloud platform, it must shift away from CapEx-oriented budgeting towards OpEx, reflecting the shift from owning infrastructure to leasing solutions. Some organizations can derive value just from this new accounting model. A startup, for example, can attract investors by demonstrating a profitable idea at large scale, without needing a large investment up front to purchase infrastructure.

To optimize costs in your organizations architecture, there are several principles that can be used to guide your efforts.

### Develop a cloud operating model

When adopting the cloud, it's important to establish an operating model that provides governance, reporting and measurement, and a framework for your organization to use to build cost-effective services. By establishing this operating model up front, you can minimize waste from the outset, and evolve your environment over time to take advantage of changes and advancements in cloud capabilities to ultimately reduce costs.

### Provision with optimization

Provisioning services that are optimized from the start can reduce work effort down the line to optimize for costs. Ensure you're selecting the appropriate service level for your workload, and take advantage of services that let you adjust service level. Use discounts wherever possible, such as reserved instances and leveraging bring-your-own-license offers.

Where possible, you want to move from IaaS to PaaS services. PaaS services typically cost less than IaaS, and typically bring reduced operational costs along as well. With PaaS services, you donâ€™t have to worry about patching or maintaining VMs because those activities are typically handled by the cloud provider. Not all applications can be moved to PaaS, but with the cost savings that are there with PaaS services, it's certainly something worth considering.

### Use monitoring and analytics to gain cost insights

If you're not monitoring your spend, you don't know what you can save. Take advantage of cost management tools and regularly review billing statements to better understand where money is being spent. Take time to conduct regular cost reviews across services to understand if the expenditure is appropriate for the resource requirements of the workload, and adjust as necessary. Identify and track down any cost anomalies that may show up on billing statements or through alerts. If you notice a large spike in cost associated with network traffic, it could uncover both cost savings and potential technical issues.

### Maximize efficiency of cloud spend

Efficiency is focused on identifying and eliminating waste within your environment. The cloud is a pay-as-you-go service and waste typically comes from provisioning more capacity than demand requires. There are operational costs that go along with this as well. These operational costs show up as wasted time and increased error. Focusing on these as you design your architecture will help you identify and eliminate waste across your environment.

Waste can show up in several ways. Let's look at a few examples:

* A virtual machine that is always 90% idle
* Paying for a license included in a virtual machine when a license is already owned
* Retaining infrequently accessed data on a storage medium optimized for frequent access
* Manually repeating the build of a non-production environment

In each of these cases, more money is being spent than it should, and each presents an opportunity for cost reduction.

As you evaluate your cost, take the opportunity to optimize environments. Capacity demands can and will change over time, and many cloud services have the ability to manually or dynamically adjust the provisioned resources to meet the demands. These adjustments can drive the balance between a well-running application at the most cost-effective size. Optimize your systems at every level. At the network level, ensure that data transfer is efficient and meets the expectations of your customers. Use services to cache data to increase application performance and reduce the transaction load on your data storage services. Identify and decommission unused resources, and take advantage of lower-cost data storage tiers to archive infrequently accessed data.
