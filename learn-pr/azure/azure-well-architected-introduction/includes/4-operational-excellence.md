Just moving resources to the cloud is only taking advantage of a small portion of what the cloud can bring to your organization. Along with the technical capabilities the cloud brings, you can improve your operational capabilities as well.

Here, we'll take a look at the operational excellence pillar.

## What is operational excellence?

Operational excellence is about ensuring you have full visibility into how your application is running, and ensuring the best experience for your users. Operational excellence includes making your development and release practices more agile, allowing your business to quickly adjust to changes. 

There are several principles that you can use when driving operational excellence through your architecture.

### Design, build, and orchestrate with modern practices

Modern architectures should be designed with DevOps and continuous integration in mind. This will give you the ability to automate deployments using infrastructure as code, automate application testing, and build new environments as needed. DevOps is as much cultural as it is technical, but can bring many benefits to organizations that embrace it.

### Use monitoring and analytics to gain operational insights

Throughout your architecture, you want to have a thorough monitoring, logging, and instrumentation system. This will give you the capability to see whatâ€™s going on. It will ensure you know when something is not right before your users are impacted. With a comprehensive approach, you'll be able to identify performance issues, cost inefficiencies, correlate events, and gain a greater ability to troubleshoot issues.

Operationally, it's important to have a robust monitoring strategy. This helps you identify areas of waste, troubleshoot issues, and optimize the performance of your application. A multilayered approach is essential. Gathering data points from components at every layer will let you alert when values are outside of acceptable values and track spending over time.

### Use automation to reduce effort and error

Automate as much as possible. The human element is costly, injecting time and error into operational activities. This increased time and error will result in increased operational costs. You can use automation to build, deploy, and administer resources. By automating common activities, you can eliminate the delay in waiting for a human to intervene.

### Test

Include testing in your application deployment and ongoing operations. A good testing strategy will help you identify issues in your application before it's deployed. It will ensure that dependant services can properly communicate with your application. It can also help identify performance issues and potential security vulnerabilities in both pre-production and production deployments. It can also uncover issues with infrastructure deployments that can impact end user experience. A robust testing plan will ensure you provide a great experience for your users.
