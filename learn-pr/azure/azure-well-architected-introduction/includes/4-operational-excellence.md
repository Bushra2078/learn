Your organization has moved a majority of their systems to the cloud, but are now seeing cost increases in areas they didn't expect. After some observation, you realize you're inefficient across your environment, and are still doing manual operational work.

Here, we'll take a look at operational excellence.

## What is operational excellence?

Operational excellence is about ensuring you have full visibility into how your application is running, and ensuring the best experience for your users. Operational excellence includes making your development and release practices more agile, allowing your business to quickly adjust to changes. 

## Principals of operational excellence

There are several principles that you can use when driving operational excellence through your architecture.

### DevOps

Modern architectures should be designed with DevOps and continuous integration in mind. This will give you the ability to automate deployments using infrastructure as code, automate application testing, and build new environments as needed. DevOps is as much cultural as it is technical, but can bring many benefits to organizations that embrace it.

### Monitoring

Throughout your architecture, you want to have a thorough monitoring, logging, and instrumentation system. This will give you the capability to see whatâ€™s going on. It will ensure you know when something is not right before your users are impacted. With a comprehensive approach, you'll be able to identify performance issues, cost inefficiencies, correlate events, and gain a greater ability to troubleshoot issues.

Operationally, it's important to have a robust monitoring strategy. This helps you identify areas of waste, troubleshoot issues, and optimize the performance of your application. A multilayered approach is essential. Gathering data points from components at every layer will let you alert when values are outside of acceptable values and track spending over time.

### Incident response

### Automation

Automate as much as possible. The human element is costly, injecting time and error into operational activities. This increased time and error will result in increased operational costs. You can use automation to build, deploy, and administer resources. By automating common activities, you can eliminate the delay in waiting for a human to intervene.

### Standardization

Variance leads to errors. By standardizing on
