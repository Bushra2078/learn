Architecture is the foundation of your application's design. Using the Azure Well-Architected framework will give you the confidence that your app can sustainably meet the needs of your customers both now and in the future.

The architectural priorities and needs of every app are different, but the five pillars in the Azure Well-Architected framework are an excellent guidepost you can use to make sure that you have given enough attention to every aspect of your application:

- **Cost optimization**
- **Operational excellence**
- **Performance efficiency**
- **Reliability**
- **Security**

Focusing on these pillars when designing your architecture will ensure you're laying a solid foundation for your applications in the cloud. With a solid foundation, you'll be able to drive innovation through your environment, build solutions that your users will love, and foster the trust of your customers.
