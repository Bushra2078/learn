Imagine you are building a new system on the cloud, or migrating an existing system to the cloud. How do you instill confidence in your customers that their data is secure? Can your architecture handle a spike in traffic if a media report goes viral? Can your architecture handle the failure of one or more critical components? Are you using resources in the most efficient manner possible?

The Azure Well-Architected framework will help you to design, build, and continuously improve a secure, reliable, and efficient application. In this module, we'll introduce you to the Azure Well-Architected framework, and the pillars and principles that are essential to a great Azure architecture.

<!-- TODO: Question since "Well-Architected" is capitalized, should "framework" also be capitalized? I realize that this is not a formal product name, but it seems a bit akward to have mismatched casing. -->

The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud. For more details on the Azure Well-Architected framework, visit the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework?azure-portal=true) as you start planning and designing your architecture.
