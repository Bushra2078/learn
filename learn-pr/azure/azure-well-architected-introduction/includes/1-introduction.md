Imagine you are building a new system on the cloud, or are migrating an existing system to the cloud. How do you instill confidence in your customers that their data is secure? Can your architecture handle a spike in traffic if a media report goes viral? Can your architecture handle the failure of one or more critical components? Are you using resources in the most efficient manner possible?

The Azure Well Architected framework will help you design, build, and continuously improve a secure, reliable, and efficient application. In this module, we'll introduce you to the Azure Well Architected framework and the pillars and principles that are essential to a great Azure architecture.

> [!NOTE]
> The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud. Microsoft publishes a broad set of patterns, guidelines, and examples on designing applications on Azure. It is highly recommended that you look through the content in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/) as you start planning and designing your architecture.
