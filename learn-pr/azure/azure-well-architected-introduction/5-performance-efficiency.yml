  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you would like to increase the availability of your system to provide a better service-level agreement (SLA) to your customers. Which of the following is a guiding principle you can use?"
    choices:
      - content: "Reduce your target for maximum duration of acceptable data loss."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This can increase recoverability, not availability."
      - content: "Encrypt all data at rest"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This can increase security, not availability."
      - content: "Eliminate single point of failure"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Designing for availability focuses on maintaining service despite temporary conditions and localized failures. Adding redundancy to eliminate single points of failure is a core strategy for improving availability."

  - content: 'Which of the following would be impacted by your defined Recovery Point Objective (RPO)?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The frequency of database backups'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Since the recovery point objective is concerned with the amount of data loss that is tolerable, the frequency of backups needs to be within this time window and is directly impacted by your defined RPO.'
    - content: 'The number of regions that data is replicated to'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The number of regions that data is replicated to is an important consideration, but is not impacted by your defined RPO.'
    - content: 'The number of instances in a database cluster'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The number of instances in a database cluster can be an important decision, but is not impacted by your defined RPO.'
    - content: 'The type of load-balancing technology used in your application'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The type of load-balancing technology used in your application can be an important decision, but is not impacted by your defined RPO.'
