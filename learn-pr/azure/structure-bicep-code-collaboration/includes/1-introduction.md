One of the biggest benefits of deploying your infrastructure as code is that your templates are shareable, and you can collaborate on your Bicep code with team members. It's important to consider how others can read and work with your Bicep code so that they can quickly and easily make use of your work. In this module, you'll learn some ways to structure and style your Bicep code to make it easy for others to understand, deploy, and modify. You'll also learn how to design your Bicep modules to support reuse and flexibility.

## Example scenario

Imagine you're working as the Azure administrator in a toy company. You've built up lots of Bicep files for all sorts of projects that your company has run.

A colleague from your quality control team just emailed you. They've been asked to run a customer survey and they need to deploy a new website and database. They're on a tight deadline so they don't want to build a whole new template if they don't have to. You have a call with them and, after speaking with them about their requirements, you remember you have a template that is close to what they need.

It's one of the first Bicep files you wrote, so you're a little worried that it might not be ready for them to use. How can you revise your template to ensure that its purpose is clear, and that it's readable and easy to maintain?

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll learn how to improve and refactor Bicep files to make your code easier for others to understand and work with. You'll learn how parameters and names are an important part of making your Bicep code and Azure deployments useful to others, and you'll learn how to define your template structure and follow a consistent style so that your colleagues will be able to understand how your template works. You'll also learn how comments and other metadata can be used to document your code and resources, and you'll break down Bicep code into reusable modules.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to author Bicep templates that are modular, reusable, and well-documented.

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with Bicep structure and syntax, including parameters, modules, and conditions.

To follow along with the exercises in the module, you'll need the following installed locally:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- The [Bicep extension for Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep)
