You sit down with your colleague in the quality control team, and open up your template. You start to talk through it with them.

But as you work your way through the template, your colleague starts to get confused. Maybe your template needs some improvement to help them understand what's happening?

Take a look at the template. How many issues can you find? You're seeing the template for the first time - do you understand what everything in the template is doing? What could you do to improve the template?

## Save the Bicep file

Throughout this module, you'll improve the template to follow best practices and to make it clearer, more understandable, and easier for your colleague to work with. First, you need to download the template and save it locally so you can work with it.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a new file called *main.bicep*.

1. Copy the Bicep template above into the file.

1. Save the changes to the file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The process of improving code is called _refatoring_. When you refactor code, it's a good idea to use a version control system like Git. That way, you can make experimental changes and easily undo them or return to a previous version.
>
> In this module, we don't require that you use Git to save your file - but it's a good idea to do so, so consider it an optional extra.
