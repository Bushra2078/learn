You agreed to share your Bicep template with your colleague, but as they started to look at it with you, it was clear they were confused about what it was doing. You wanted to refactor the template to make it easier for your colleague to understand, reuse, and modify.

In this module, you learned how to write and structure your Bicep code to support collaboration. You refactored your template to improve the parameters and resource names, restructured it to make it easier to understand and use, and you added documentation in the form of comments and metadata. Along the way, you learned how the Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code can help you to refactor and reorganize your Bicep code. The changes you made to your Bicep code meant that your colleague was able to use your template, and they met their deadline!

When you're working individually, it's easy to forget to structure your Bicep code so that it's understandable to others. But by building up some good habits and investing just a little time, you can make it easy for your colleagues to deploy your template and to build on your work - and you make it easier on yourself when you need to look at your Bicep code in the future, too.
