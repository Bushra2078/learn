You agreed to share your Bicep template with your colleagues, but as you began reviewing it together, it became clear that they were confused about what it was doing. You wanted to refactor the template to make it easier for your colleagues to understand, reuse, and modify.

In this module, you learned how to write and structure your Bicep code to support collaboration. You refactored your template to improve the parameters and resource names. You restructured it to make it easier to understand and use. And you added explanatory documentation in the form of comments and metadata. 

Along the way, you learned how the Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code can help you refactor and reorganize your Bicep code. The changes you made to your Bicep code meant that your colleagues were able to use your template, and they met their deadline!

When you're working individually, it's easy to forget to structure your Bicep code so that it's understandable to others. But by establishing good habits, applying best practices, and investing just a little time, you can make it easy for your colleagues to deploy your template and to build on your work. 

You're also making it easier on yourself when you need to use your Bicep code in the future.
