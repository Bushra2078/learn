      When you execute the workflow you get the following error message: _Az CLI Login failed. Please check the credentials._
      
      How can you fix this error? 
    choices:
    - content: Check your GitHub secrets in settings and see whether there is an `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. Regenerate your service principal and paste it back in the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret. 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The Azure Login action makes use of the AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret. This secret should exist in your GitHub secret settings and should have a valid value. 
    - content: Double check the name of the resource group you are deploying to - it is probably incorrect.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Your workflow output indicates it is not able to log in given the credentials you provided. You should check your AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret and refresh your credentials.
    - content: Check the runner your workflow is running on. It is not able to log into Azure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Your runner only executes the Azure Login action with the credentials you provide to it. You should check your AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret and refresh your credentials.
  - content: In which of these situations will the workflow run?
    choices:
    - content: Someone commits an update to the _README.md_ file in the root directory on the **main** branch.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The trigger only includes all files in the _deploy_ folder.
    - content: Someone commits an update to any file in the _deploy_ folder, on any branch.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Changes to files in the _deploy_ folder will trigger the pipeline, but only when they are on the **main** branch.
    - content: Someone commits an update to the _main.bicep_ file in the _deploy_ folder, on the **main** branch.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The _deploy/main.bicep_ file matches the path filter. Additionally, the **main** branch matches the branch filter.
  - content: Which of the following statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: Before running your workflow with a actions runner, you need to make sure the runner has started, and after it's done, you you need to shut down the runner so that it doesn't use up any resources.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to start or stop GitHub-hosted runners. GitHub manages them for you.
    - content: GitHub-hosted runners contain all of the software necessary to deploy Bicep files.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. GitHub-hosted runners include a set of predefined software, including Bicep.
    - content: After your workflow has finished running, you can sign in to the GitHub-hosted runner to check the logs of the workflow run.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. GitHub-hosted runners only exist during the lifetime of your workflow run. After the workflow completes, the runner is destroyed and not used anymore. If you want to see the logs of your run, you should do so in the GitHub Actions web interface.
