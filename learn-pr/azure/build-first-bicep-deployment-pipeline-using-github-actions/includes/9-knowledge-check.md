The R&D team at your toy company has asked you to help them with their workflow definition. Here's the YAML file:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'deploy/**'

name: AzureBicepSample

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
        tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
        subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
    - uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
      with:
        resourceGroupName: ${{ env.AZURE_RESOURCEGROUP_NAME }}
        template: ./deploy/main.bicep
        parameters: environmentType=${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }}
```

When you execute your workflow you get the following error message:

```
ERROR: An error occurred reading file. Could not find a part of the path '/home/runner/work/myrepo/myrepo/deploy/main.bicep'.
```
