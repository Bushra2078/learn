Now that you have had the opportunity to learn about the Cost Analysis tool it's time to put that tool to work. Pick one of your Azure subscriptions and identify the your most costly resource. Some guidance and additional questions you can investigate are below.

- Consider using the **Group by** option in Cost Analysis. Which dimension would be the most applicable to determining your biggest cost driver?
- Is it possible to switch your view to see how much this resource is costing you each day?
- Try filtering down to your most costly resource. As a bonus, try to see which Azure meters are accruing cost for this resource. Hint â€“ you can use **Group by** here again.
- Is it possible to see more than one month of data?
