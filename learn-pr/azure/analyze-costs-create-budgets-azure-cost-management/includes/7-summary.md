You learned about Cost Management principles and basic concepts you should put into action to manage costs. You evaluated costs using cost analysis, and looked at costs in detail. You exported cost and usage data so that you can use the data outside of Azure. You found your most expensive Azure resource and looked for cost trends. And, you created budgets and alerts to help keep costs under control.

We trust that you've found the *Analyze costs and create budgets with Azure Cost Management* module useful. To conclude, take the knowledge that you've learned here, and apply it practically in your organization to monitor and control your Azure costs, and to optimize your resource use.
