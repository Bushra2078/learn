In this exercise, you'll explore one scenario for bulk loading data from Azure Blob storage using T-SQL and Shared Access Signatures (SAS) into Azure SQL Database.  

For this activity, you'll use the notebook called **LoadData.ipynb** which is under `\mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals\02-DeployAndConfigure\loaddata`. In a previous exercise, you opened the folder in Azure Data Studio, so you should be able to navigate to that file in Azure Data Studio to complete this exercise, and then return here.  

If you are unable to complete the exercise for any reason, you can review the results in the [corresponding notebook file on GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/blob/master/02-DeployAndConfigure/loaddata/LoadData.ipynb).
