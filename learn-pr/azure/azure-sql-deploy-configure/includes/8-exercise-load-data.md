In this exercise, you'll explore one scenario for bulk loading data from Azure Blob storage using T-SQL and Shared Access Signatures (SAS) into Azure SQL Database.

There are two options for completing this exercise:

1. sqlcmd in the Azure Cloud shell (follow along this page)
1. SQL Notebooks in Azure Data Studio

Both exercises contain the same commands and content, so you can choose the option you prefer.

### Option 1: sqlcmd in the Azure Cloud shell



### Option 2: SQL Notebooks in Azure Data Studio

For this activity, you'll use the notebook called **LoadData.ipynb** which located in `\mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals\02-DeployAndConfigure\loaddata` on your device. Open this file in Azure Data Studio to complete this exercise, and then return here.  

If you are unable to complete the exercise for any reason, you can review the results in the [corresponding notebook file on GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/blob/master/02-DeployAndConfigure/loaddata/LoadData.ipynb).
