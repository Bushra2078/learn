### Configure with Azure CLI</b>

So you've seen the Azure portal, SSMS, and SQL Notebooks in ADS, but there are other tools available to you to use to manage Azure SQL. Two of the most popular are the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) and [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure). They are similar in their functionality, but for this activity we will focus on the Azure CLI.  

To complete this activity, you'll use a PowerShell notebook, which is the same concept as a SQL notebook, but the coding language is PowerShell. You can use PowerShell notebooks to leverage Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell, but we will focus on Azure CLI. For more information on the Azure PowerShell module, [see the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-powershell-samples?tabs=single-database). For both of these tools, you can also use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview), which is an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser in the Azure portal.  

In the example that follows, you'll also explore the latency effects of using different connection policies in Azure SQL.  

For this activity, you'll use the notebook called **AzureCli.ipynb** which is under `azuresqlworkshop\02-DeployAndConfigure\cli\AzureCli.ipynb`. Navigate to that file in ADS to complete this activity, and then return here.
