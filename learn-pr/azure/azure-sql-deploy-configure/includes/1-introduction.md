In this module, you'll learn about the process of deploying and configuring Azure SQL. Through hands-on exercises, you will deploy and configure specifically Azure SQL Database. You will also see comparisons to both Azure SQL Managed Instance and SQL Server. In addition to the Azure portal, you'll work with SSMS, Azure Data Studio (including SQL Notebooks), and the Azure CLI.

This module is the second module in the Azure SQL Fundamentals learning path. The recommendation is to complete Azure SQL introduction module before continuing.

At the end of this module, you will be able to:  

* Plan for a deployment of Azure SQL
* Deploy and verify Azure SQL with common tools and interfaces
* Configure Azure SQL after deployment
* Load data into Azure SQL

## Prerequisites for exercises  

A sandbox environment is provided for you to deploy Azure resources. However, you do need to do a few things on your local machine to complete the exercises:  

* Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)
* Disable VPN connectivity while you complete the exercises.
* Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15&azure-portal=true)
* Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15&azure-portal=true)
* Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.  

If you cannot complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
