title: Deploy and configure servers, instances, and databases for Azure SQL
summary: In this module, you'll learn about the process of deploying and configuring Azure SQL. Through hands-on exercises, you will deploy and configure specifically Azure SQL Database. You will also see comparisons to both Azure SQL Managed Instance and SQL Server. In addition to the Azure portal, you'll work with SSMS, Azure Data Studio (including SQL Notebooks), and the Azure CLI.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will learn how to:
  - Plan for a deployment of Azure SQL
  - Deploy and verify Azure SQL with common tools and interfaces
  - Configure Azure SQL after deployment
  - Load data into Azure SQL
prerequisites: | 
  - Experience working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server
  - Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources

  For the exercises, a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, you need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

  - Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)  
  - Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true)
  - Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?azure-portal=true)
  - Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises. iconUrl: /learn/achievements/azure-sql-performance.svg
