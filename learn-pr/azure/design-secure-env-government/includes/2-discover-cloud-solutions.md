As government agencies look for tools and solutions to move their workloads to the cloud, they’re faced with specific concerns around data residency, security, and isolation. Microsoft Azure provides public sector customers with the tools and flexibility to design solutions to fit their legal and technological requirements.

## Azure in the public sector

For governments and the public sector industry worldwide, Microsoft provides Azure, a public multi-tenant cloud services platform. A multi-tenant cloud platform implies that multiple customer applications and data are stored on the same physical hardware. Azure uses logical isolation to segregate each customer's applications and data from those of others. This approach provides the scale and economic benefits of multi-tenant cloud services while preventing customers from accessing one another's data or applications. A hyperscale public cloud provides resiliency in time of natural disaster and warfare. The cloud allows for failover redundancy and gives sovereign nations flexibility with global resiliency planning. Hyperscale public cloud also offers many features that incorporate the latest cloud innovations. These features, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT services, intelligent edge, help government customers increase efficiency and unlock insights into their operations and performance.

Using Azure’s public cloud capabilities, customers benefit from rapid feature growth, resiliency, and the cost-effective operation of the hyperscale cloud. The cloud also provides the levels of isolation, security, and confidence required to handle workloads across a broad spectrum of data classifications, including unclassified and classified data.

With Azure data protection technologies and intelligent edge capabilities (such as Azure Stack and Data Box Edge), customers can process confidential and secret data in secure, isolated infrastructure. Options include Azure public multi-tenant regions or top-secret data at the edge, under the customer’s full operational control.

Now let’s look at a sample conceptual architecture that accounts for these various classification levels.
