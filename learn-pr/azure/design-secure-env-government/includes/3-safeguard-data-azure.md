Protection of sensitive data is essential in the public sector and Azure provides many features and services that safeguard data throughout its lifecycle. These features allow government agencies to maintain full control over their data and comply with local regulations around data protection and privacy.

## Safeguarding data with Azure

A multi-tenant cloud platform implies that multiple customer applications and data are stored on the same physical hardware. Azure uses logical isolation to segregate each customer's applications and data from those of others. This approach provides the scale and economic benefits of multi-tenant cloud services. At the same time, it prevents unauthorized access to customer applications and data. Azure is available globally in more than 50 regions and can be used by customers worldwide to meet data protection and privacy requirements.

Microsoft Azure provides strong customer commitments for data residency and transfer policies. Most Azure services allow the customer to specify the deployment region. For those services, Microsoft won’t store customer data outside the customer specified geography. Customers can use extensive and robust data encryption options to safeguard their data in Azure and control who can access it.

Some of the options available to customers to safeguard their data in Azure are listed below:

* Customers can choose to store their most sensitive customer content in services that store customer data at rest in Geo.
* Customers can further protect their data by encrypting it with their own key using Azure Key Vault.
* Data encryption in transit helps protect data from interception.
* Azure is a 24 x 7 globally operated service; however, support and troubleshooting rarely require access to customer data.
* Customers who want added control for support and troubleshooting can use Customer Lockbox for Azure to approve or deny access to their data.
* Microsoft will notify customers of any breach of customer or personal data within 72 hours of incident declaration.
* Customers can monitor potential threats and respond to incidents on their own using Azure Security Center.
