quiz:
  questions:
  - content: When creating an HDInsight on AKS cluster, what is the primary consideration for determining the size and scale based on workload requirements?
    choices:
      - content: Number of worker nodes
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Correct. The size and scale are primarily determined by the number of worker nodes.
      - content: Storage capacity
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Storage capacity is not the primary consideration for size and scale.
      - content: Network bandwidth
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Network bandwidth is not the primary consideration for size and scale.
      - content: CPU clock speed
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. CPU clock speed is not the primary consideration for size and scale.
  - content: In HDInsight on AKS, what is the significance of enabling autoscaling for adjusting the number of worker nodes based on workload demands?
    choices:
      - content: Reducing storage costs
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Autoscaling is not primarily for reducing storage costs.
      - content: Automatically adjusting cluster size
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Correct. Autoscaling adjusts the cluster size based on workload demands.
      - content: Enhancing network security
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Autoscaling is not primarily for enhancing network security.
      - content: Improving query performance
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Autoscaling is not primarily for improving query performance.
  - content: What is the purpose of enabling Azure Log Analytics and Azure managed Prometheus in HDInsight on AKS?
    choices:
      - content: Real-time data streaming
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Enabling Log Analytics and managed Prometheus is not primarily for real-time data streaming.
      - content: Analyzing cluster metrics, logs, and diagnostics
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Correct. Log Analytics and managed Prometheus are used for analyzing cluster metrics, logs, and diagnostics.
      - content: Ensuring data encryption
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Ensuring data encryption is not the primary purpose of Log Analytics and managed Prometheus.
      - content: Optimizing storage performance
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Optimizing storage performance is not the primary purpose of Log Analytics and managed Prometheus.
