After you define the data that is sensitive for your organization or your business, you need to classify that data. Data classification is important as it allows you to differentiate between various types of sensitive data and to prepare the data for the appropriate level and method of protection.

Data classification provides one of the most basic ways for organizations to determine and assign relative values to the data they possess. The process of data classification allows organizations to categorize their stored data by sensitivity and business impact. This categorization helps determine the risks associated with the data. After the process is complete, organizations can manage their data in ways that reflect its value to them instead of treating all data the same way. Data classification is a conscious, thoughtful approach that enables organizations to realize optimizations that might not be possible when all data is assigned the same value.

> You can think of data classification as kind of sorting and marking your documents. Many years ago, when organizations had important information in paper form, they were usually storing them in plastic folders and marking these folders with labels, for example, "Confidential contracts." After marking these folders, they were usually stored at a safe location. Today, when you classify electronic forms, you mark them by adding metadata that specifies the classification and then use an appropriate technology to help protect the data.

Large organizations such as Microsoft, governments, and military entities have been using data classification for decades to manage the integrity of their data.

Successful data classification in an organization requires a broad awareness of the organization’s needs and a thorough understanding of where the organization’s data assets reside. Data exists in one of three basic states:

- At rest
- In process
- In transit

All three states require unique technical solutions for data classification, but the applied principles of data classification should be the same for each. Data that's classified as confidential needs to stay confidential when at rest, in process, and in transit. Classification and protection must never leave the data if it's considered sensitive.

Data can also be either structured or unstructured. Typical classification processes for the structured data found in databases and spreadsheets are less complex and time-consuming to manage than the classification processes for unstructured data such as documents, source code, and email. In most cases, organizations will have more unstructured data than structured data. Regardless of whether data is structured or unstructured, it's important for organizations to manage data sensitivity. When properly implemented, data classification helps ensure that sensitive or confidential data assets are managed with greater oversight than data assets that are considered public or free to distribute.

## Data classification and compliance

The purpose of data classification is not only to provide metadata to your documents and prepare data for protection, but often also to aid in compliance, privacy, and data governance. For example, marking data as *confidential* doesn’t serve only to mark this data for protection, but also to let other parties know how to manage that data. When an employee sends the data via email, and classifies that data as sensitive or confidential, the recipient of that email should treat the received data in the appropriate manner. Data protection regulations, such as GDPR, specify methods and best practices for treating, accessing, storing, using, and destroying sensitive data. Also, sometimes, relevant regulatory and industry-specific rules mandate the type of data classification. This might require the classification of different data attributes.

As you just learned, the importance of data classification varies across several layers. Therefore, it's important that the people who manage the data understand what data classification really means and how it differs from data protection. Each organization must work on raising awareness on data classification in the context of data governance, and not only technical data protection. Usually, data protection comes because of data classification. However, even protected data is sometimes accessed by the people who need it. People who access protected data need to know how to manage the data, not based on how data is protected, but how it's classified.
