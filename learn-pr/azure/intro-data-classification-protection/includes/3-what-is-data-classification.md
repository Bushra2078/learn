After you define what data are sensitive for your organization or your business, you need to classify the data. Data classification is very important as it allows you to differentiate various type of sensitive data and also to prepare the data for appropriate level and method of protection.

## What is Data Classification?

Data classification provides one of the most basic ways for organizations to determine and assign relative values to the data they possess. The process of data classification allows organizations to categorize their stored data by sensitivity and business impact. This categorization is done in order to determine the risks associated with the data. After the process is completed, organizations can manage their data in ways that reflect its value to them instead of treating all data the same way. Data classification is a conscious, thoughtful approach that enables organizations to realize optimizations that might not be possible when all data is assigned the same value.

> You can think of data classification as some kind of labelling. Many years ago, when organization had important information in paper form, they were usually storing them in plastic folders and marking these folders with appropriate labels (for example, label can be - Confidential contracts). After storing and labeling these papers, they were usually stored at some safe storage. Today, when we classify electronic form, we label them by adding meta data that specify classification and we then use appropriate technology to protect the data.

Data classification has been used for decades to help large organizations such as Microsoft, governments, and military entities manage the integrity of their data. 

Successful data classification in an organization requires broad awareness of the organization’s needs and a thorough understanding of where the organization’s data assets reside. Data exists in one of three basic states: 

- at rest 
- in process 
- in transit

All three states require unique technical solutions for data classification, but the applied principles of data classification should be the same for each. Data that is classified as confidential needs to stay confidential when at rest, in process, and in transit. Classification and protection must never leave the data, as long as it is considered sensitive.

Data can also be either structured or unstructured. Typical classification processes for the structured data found in databases and spreadsheets are less complex and time-consuming to manage than those for unstructured data such as documents, source code, and email. In most cases, organizations will have more unstructured data than structured data. Regardless of whether data is structured or unstructured, it is important for organizations to manage data sensitivity. When properly implemented, data classification helps ensure that sensitive or confidential data assets are managed with greater oversight than data assets that are considered public or free to distribute.

## Data classification and compliance

Purpose of data classification process is not only to provide data labelling and prepare data for protection. Data classification, as we said before, if often required for compliance, privacy and data governance reasons. For example, labelling data as *confidential* does not serve only to mark this data for protection, but also to let other parties know how to handle specific data. When an employee sends the data via email, and classify that data as sensitive or confidential, the recipient of that email should treat the received data in appropriate way. Data protection regulations, such as GDPR, specify how sensitive data should be treated, accessed, stored, used and destroyed. Also, sometimes, relevant regulatory and industry-specific mandates the type of data classification. This may require classification of different data attributes.

> For example, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) requires that data and data objects must include data type, jurisdiction of origin and domicile, context, legal constraints, sensitivity.

Because of this, it is very important that people who handle data understand what data classification really means and how it differs from data protection. It important that each organization works on raising awareness on data classification in the context of data governance, not only technical data protection. Usually, data protection comes as a result of data classification. However, even protected data is sometimes accessed by people who need it. People who access protected data need to know how to handle the data, not based on how data is protected, but how it is classified.
