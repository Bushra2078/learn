Every system, architecture, and application needs to be designed with security in mind. There's just too much at risk. For instance, a denial of service attack prevents you from doing business. Defacement of your website damages your reputation. And a data breach is perhaps worst of all &mdash; as it can ruin hard-earned trust, all while causing significant personal and financial harm. As administrators, developers, and IT management, we all must work to guarantee the security of our systems.

Let's say you work at a company called Contoso Shipping, and you're spearheading the development of drone deliveries in rural areasâ€”while having truck drivers leverage mobile apps to deliver to urban areas. You're in the process of moving a lot of their infrastructure to the cloud to maximize efficiency, as well as moving several physical servers in their data center to Azure virtual machines. Your team plans on creating a hybrid solution, with some of the servers remaining on-premises, so they will need a secure, high-quality connection between the new virtual machines and the existing network.

Additionally, Contoso Shipping has some out-of-network devices that are part of your operations. You are using network-enabled sensors in your drones that send data to Azure Event Hubs, while delivery drivers use mobile apps to get route maps and record signatures for receipt of shipments. These devices and apps must be securely authenticated before data can be sent to or from them.

So how do you keep your data secure?
