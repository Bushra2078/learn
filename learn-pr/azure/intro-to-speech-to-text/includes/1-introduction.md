Speech-to-text, also known as speech recognition, enables the real-time transcription of audio streams into text. It allows quick and accurate transcription from multiple audio sources to text in more than 90 languages and variants.

In addition to the standard speech-to-text service, you can also create custom acoustic, language, and pronunciation models. Customization helps you overcome speech recognition barriers such as speaking style, vocabulary, and background noise in your audio. Further, batch transcription is possible for longer audio or a large number of files. With batch transcription, you can enable features like timestamping and profanity filtering to your transcribed text.
