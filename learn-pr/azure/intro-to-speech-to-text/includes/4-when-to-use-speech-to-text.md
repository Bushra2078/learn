Speech-to-text is becoming more central in our daily interactions with computers, smartphones, and AI. With speech-to-text, you can use more natural forms of communication to ease interactions with applications and AI, which allows a larger audience to use the application or services by providing a more accessible product.

## Assistive technology

Speech-to-text can be used to help people work hands free, such as within the medical field. Rather than spending valuable time manually filling in medical charts and documents, practitioners can use the custom speech service to quickly and accurately dictate. Practitioners can dictate knowing their industry-specific terminology won’t be lost in the transcription.  

Further, medical practitioners can keep a transcription of their conversations with colleagues and patients. These digital transcriptions can help to reduce communication errors and increase accountability. Digitizing this data allows medical practitioners to be more accurate in their assessments of ongoing and new patients, as they have a precise and detailed account of the entire medical history.

## Increasing accessibility

Speech-to-text services provide a more inclusive environment. By reducing the need for manual typing, people with disabilities are able to more easily communicate with peers and applications, promoting further independence. Speech-to-text can also be used to create more accessible conversations for people with hearing impairments.

By integrating Speech-to-text with Translator, real-time transcription and translation can also make conversations more accessible for people who speak different languages. Further, Speech-to-text can be used to increase accessibility in the media through automatic subtitles of what is being spoken, meaning every person can actively participate in the discussion.

## Meeting compliance standards

Many corporations and government agencies must meet compliance standards when interacting with customers, which is typically done by recording and monitoring phone calls. Yet to meet the standard would require massive amounts of manual intervention and be prone to errors because of the difficult nature of transcribing telephone data. By using Speech-to-text companies and government bodies can have their calls transcribed at a faster rate, meaning meeting compliance standards becomes easier, resulting in more accountability overall.

## Organization communication

With more people now working from home and in international teams, the need for accurate transcription of meetings is larger than ever. Conversation Transcription can help to ensure every one is on the same page by providing an exact transcription of any conversation. Conversation transcription can be integrated with Translator and used in real time to translate, transcribe, and identify who is speaking to create a more inclusive work environment and eliminate communication barriers between team members. You can also use the asynchronous transcription so that participants don’t have to worry about taking their own notes during meetings. Overall, promoting higher involvement in the discussions as they can find a copy of the meeting minutes after.
