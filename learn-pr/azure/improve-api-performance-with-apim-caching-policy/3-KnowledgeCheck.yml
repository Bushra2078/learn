  title: 'Knowledge check'
  questions:
  - 
  content: 'Given that users are not being authenticated which type of throttling would you use to limit access based on IP Address'
  choices:
    - content: 'Product based throttling'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Because rate throttling capabilities are limited to being scoped to a particular Product subscription this type of throttling is no use
      when trying to individual users accessing your API'
    - content: 'User identity throttling '
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'To use user identity throttling your user must be authenticated, in this scenario this is not the case'
    - content: 'IP address throttling'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Even though it may not be that accurate with many users sharing the same IP adress accessing your API via a NAT this is the only option for APIs that allow unauthenticated access'
    - content: 'client driven throttling.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'When the throttling key is defined using a policy expression the provider of the API is controlling the scope. Client driven throttling
              occurs when the client using information provided in the header for the API can decide how they wish to create and distribute rate keys to users.'
  content: 'You wish to apply the policy to all of your APIs within your APIM service. Which scope would you place it in ?.'
  choices:
    - content: 'Global'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Policies placed Global Scope by selecting the All APIs menu item are applied to all APIs'
    - content: 'Product '
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Only applies to APIs linked to a Product'
    - content: 'API'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Only applies to a particular API'
    - content: 'Operation.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Only applies to a particular operation in a particular API'
  content: 'Where would you place your policy to restrict access ?.'
  choices:
    - content: 'inbound'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'It would be placed in the inbound tag as you are applying a rule to restrict inbound traffic'
    - content: 'outbound'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Outbound only applies to responses, we are trying to restrict requests'
    - content: 'backend'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This tag only applies to activity on the backend'
    - content: 'on-error.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This tag only applies to the handling of errors'
  content: 'Where would you place your policy for caching ?.'
  choices:
    - content: 'In operation scope cache-lookup in inbound and cache-store in outbound'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Your policy would contain both cache-lookup and cache-store elements to provide functionality to select what to cache in the cache-lookup for the request and how long for in the cache-store for the response'
    - content: 'In Global scope cache-lookup in inbound and cache-store in outbound' 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Global scope applies to all APIs'
    - content: 'In operation scope cache-lookup in inbound and cache-store in outbound'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'API Scope applies to all operations in an individual API not an individual operation'
    - content: 'In Product Scope.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This only applies to APIs associated with products'
