      isCorrect: false
      explaination: 'Because rate throttling capabilities are limited to being scoped to a particular Product subscription this type of throttling is no use

      isCorrect: false
      explaination: 'To use user identity throttling your user must be authenticated, in this scenario this is not the case'
    - content: 'IP address throttling'
