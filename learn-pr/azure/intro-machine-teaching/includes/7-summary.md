To produce soap with an extruder, the company currently uses advanced process control (APC) systems combined with expert operators to control the extrusion process. The operators pass supervisory commands to the APC system to implement control strategies. The APC system adjusts the line equipment based on the control strategy. However, the current control system only controls a narrow range of scenarios, and it is unresponsive to unknown inputs and changing system behavior. 

Machine Teaching helps you improve on the existing control systems by passing the knowledge of subject matter expertise into the algorithms to train AI brains. Trained AI brains provide the ability to adapt to a wide range of scenarios, and to learn strategies for unexpected input and changing conditions.
