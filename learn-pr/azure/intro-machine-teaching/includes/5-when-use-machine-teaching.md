Machine Teaching can excel in highly dynamic conditions when traditional control systems can't keep up. Machine Teaching can also be deployed where the desired system behavior requires subject matter experts who understand the problem domain or when experts can’t identify or calculate the best next decision to make for a particular scenario fast enough or it varies from expert to expert. Another use is to capture expert operators' skills to train novices, freeing up the expert’s time for more strategic tasks.

Traditional Machine Learning systems are excellent for advance perception, classification and prediction, but they don’t make human-like decisions nor automatically learn strategies. DRL learns how to make human-like decisions and automatically learns strategies. Machine Teaching combines these previously mentioned technologies, using the simplest technology that solves the task for each module of the brain.

Machine Teaching is useful when:

- Human-like decisions that bring high business value have to be made. For example, when there’s fuzzy boundaries in between known good strategies.
- The behavior of the system has to adapt to different scenarios or circumstances that aren't clearly defined.
- The decision needs an understanding of complex perception.
- The decisions undertaken are part of a long-term strategy.
- The process often needs human intervention and has many exceptions.

Note that this doesn't mean that Machine Teaching will replace human decision-making. Instead, autonomous systems can act as a decision-support system for human operators. Working with human operators, several collaboration scenarios are possible. Sometimes autonomous systems can directly control equipment, like drones or robotic arms, to perform complicated tasks for humans. Other times, Autonomous AI and Machine teaching takes over one function from an automated system while a human retains control of other functions. Machine Teaching can be used as a supervisory control, and it can also train humans to make better decisions.
