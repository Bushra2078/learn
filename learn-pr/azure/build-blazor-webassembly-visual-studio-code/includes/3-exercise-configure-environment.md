Let's start by creating our first Blazor web app.

This module uses the [.NET CLI (Command Line Interface)](/dotnet/core/tools/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for local development. After completing this module, you can apply its concepts using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS), or continued development using Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, & macOS). 

## Create a new Blazor app

To set up a Blazor project to work with, we'll use Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code includes an integrated terminal, which makes creating a new project easy. If you don't want to use another code editor, you can run the commands in this module in a terminal.

1. In Visual Studio Code, select **File** > **Open Folder**.

1. Create a new folder named **BlazorApp** in the location of your choice, and then click **Select Folder**.

1. Open the integrated terminal from Visual Studio Code by selecting **View** > **Terminal** from the main menu.

1. In the terminal window, copy and paste the following command.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new blazorserver
    ```

    This command creates a basic Blazor server project with all required files and pages, along with a C# project file named **BlazorApp.csproj**.

    You should now have access to these files.

    ```bash
    -| bin
    -| Data
    -| obj
    -| Pages
      -| _Host.cshtml
      -| Counter.razor
      -| Error.cshtml
      -| Error.cshtml.cs
      -| FethData.razor
      -| Index.razor
    -| Properties
    -| Shared
      -| MainLayout.razor
      -| MainLayout.razor.css
      -| NavMenu.razor
      -| NavMenu.razor.css
      -| SurveyPrompt.razor
    -| wwwroot
    -| _Imports.razor
    -| App.razor
    -| appsettings.Development.json
    -| appsettings.json
    -| BlazorApp.csproj
    -| Program.cs
    -| Startup.cs
    ```

1. If Visual Studio Code prompts you to install required assets, select **Yes**.

## Run the app

1. In the terminal window, copy and paste the following command to run the app in **watch mode**:
 
    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet watch run
    ```

    This will build and start the app, and then rebuild and restart the app whenever you make code changes.  The browser should automatically open at the address https://localhost:5000.

1. When you're ready to stop, return to the terminal in Visual Studio code, and press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to stop the app.

You'll use this Blazor app in the following exercises.
