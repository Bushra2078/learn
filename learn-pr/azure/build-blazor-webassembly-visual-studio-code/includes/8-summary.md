In this module, we set up our development environment to create and build Blazor WebAssembly web apps. We then created a new Razor component, added HTML and C# to the razor file, and used binding to sync user input to the calculator logic. You now understand the fundamentals of building Blazor WebAssembly apps and can use your HTML and C# knowledge to build more complex client web apps.
