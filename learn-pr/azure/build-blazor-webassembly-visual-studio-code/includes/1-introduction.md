Blazor lets C# developers use their existing skills to build client web applications with C# and Microsoft .NET.

Imagine you're building a client-side web application and already have a talented team of .NET developers. Also imagine you want the option of deploying your web app as a Progressive Web Application so your users can download the app and use it offline.

Blazor lets developers build front-end and back-end logic for web apps with a common development language along with common frameworks and tools. Using the same language for front-end and back-end code can:

- Accelerate app development.
- Reduce the complexity of the build pipeline.
- Simplify maintenance.
- Let developers understand and work on both client-side and server-side code.

## Learning objectives

- Configure your local environment for Blazor development with Visual Studio Code.
- Create a new Blazor WebAssembly project.
- Add a razor page to a Blazor project.
