Blazor lets C# developers use their skills to build client web apps with C# and Microsoft. NET.

Imagine you're building a client-side web app and already have a team of .NET developers. Also, imagine you want to deploy your app as a progressive web application. Users could then download the app and use it offline.

With Blazor, developers can build front-end and back-end logic for web apps with common languages, frameworks, and tools.

Using the same language for front-end and back-end code can:

- Accelerate app development.
- Reduce the complexity of the build pipeline.
- Simplify maintenance.
- Let developers understand and work on both client-side and server-side code.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Configure your local environment for Blazor development with Visual Studio Code.
- Create a new Blazor WebAssembly project.
- Add a Razor page to a Blazor project.
