In this exercise, you'll add a Razor component to the home page of our application.

## Open the BlazorApp project in Visual Studio Code

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Within Visual Studio Code, open the folder that contains the BlazorApp project we created in module 3.

1. If Visual Studio Code prompts you to install required assets, select **Yes**.

## Add the Counter component to the Home page

1. Expand the folders in the Visual Studio Code project explorer.

1. Select **Pages** to view the existing Razor pages.

1. Select the **Index.razor** file to open it.

1. Add a `Counter` component to the page by adding a `<Counter />` element at the end of the `Index.razor` file.

   ```razor
   @page "/"

   <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

   Welcome to your new app.

   <SurveyPrompt Title="How is Blazor working for you?" />

   <Counter />
   ```

Save the file and the `dotnet watch run` command you executed in the previous module will restart the app and refresh it in the browser so that the `Counter` component shows up on the Home page.

## Modify a component

 Component parameters are specified using attributes or child content, which allow you to set properties on the child component. Define a parameter on the Counter component for specifying how much it increments with every button click:

- Add a public property for `IncrementAmount` with a `[Parameter]` attribute.
- Change the `IncrementCount` method to use the `IncrementAmount` when incrementing the value of `currentCount`.

The following code shows how to achieve that. 

```razor
@page "/counter"

<h1>Counter</h1>

<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    [Parameter]
    public int IncrementAmount { get; set; } = 1;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount += IncrementAmount;
    }
}
```

In `Index.razor`, update the `<Counter>` element to add an `IncrementAmount` attribute that changes the increment amount to ten as shown by the highlighted line in the following code:

```razor
@page "/"

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

Welcome to your new app.

<SurveyPrompt Title="How is Blazor working for you?" />

<Counter IncrementAmount="10" />
```

The `Index` component now has its own counter that increments by ten each time the **Click me** button is selected, as shown in the following image. The `Counter` component (`Counter.razor`) at `/counter` continues to increment by one.
