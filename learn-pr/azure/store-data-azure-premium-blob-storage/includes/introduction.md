Azure Premium Blob Storage helps customers optimize performance of their business-critical workloads that rely on low and consistent latency. 

### Example scenario

Suppose you work for a media company that stores, processes, and maintains large volumes of online content for its subscribers. For most of the data, the company relies on Azure Blob Storage as a persistent, readily accessible, and inexpensive data store.

However, as the number of its customers grows, the company is observing an alarming increase in customer complaints about delays associated with downloading online content. At the same time, your management team starts expressing its concerns about an unexpected increase in storage transaction-related charges.

The highly competitive nature of the online business forces your company to reevaluate its storage strategy to make its service more appealing to customers, while finding cost saving opportunities.

As a cloud administrator responsible for optimizing the use of Azure resources, you need to identify the solution that would reconcile these two seemingly conflicting goals. To accomplish this objective, you decide to explore the performance characteristics and the pricing model of Azure Blob Storage, focusing on the use of Azure Premium Blob Storage.

In this module, you'll explore the performance characteristics and benefits offered by Azure Premium Blob Storage and identify scenarios where these benefits are particularly relevant. You'll also review the steps in an exercise that will validate these benefits by using a custom testing application. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe the benefits of Azure Premium Blob Storage, identify business critical workloads that can utilize these benefits, and demonstrate how to validate these benefits.
