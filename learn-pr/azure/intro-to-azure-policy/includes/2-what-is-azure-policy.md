## What is Azure Policy?

Azure Policy is a service that you use to create, assign, and manage policy definitions. Policy definitions impose different rules and actions on your resources, so that those resources remain in compliance with your corporate standards and service level agreements. The policy focuses on the properties of resources during deployment and for existing resources. It performs an assessment of your resources, checking those that do not conform to the policy definitions you have.

In summary, you will be using Azure Policy to:

* Enforcement & Compliance
  * Turn on built-in policies or build custom ones for all resource types
  * Real-time policy evaluation and enforcement
  * Periodic & on-demand compliance evaluation
  * Virtual Machine In-Guest Policy

  * Apply policies to a Management Group with control across  your entire organization
  * Apply multiple policies and aggregate policy states with policy initiative
  * Handle exclusion scopes
* Remediation
