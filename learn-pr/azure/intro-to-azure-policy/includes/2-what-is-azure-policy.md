Azure Policy is a service that you use to create, assign, and manage policy definitions. Policy definitions impose rules and actions on your resources so that those resources remain in compliance with your corporate standards and service-level agreements. 

Azure Policy focuses on the properties of resources during deployment and for existing resources. It performs an assessment of your resources, checking those that don't conform to your policy definitions.

In summary, you'll use Azure Policy to:

* Enforce compliance:
  * Turn on built-in policies or build custom policies for all resource types.
  * Perform real-time policy evaluation and enforcement.
  * Perform periodic and on-demand compliance evaluation.
  * Implement virtual machine In-Guest Policy.
* Apply policies at scale:
  * Apply policies to a management group with control across your entire organization.
  * Apply multiple policies and aggregate policy states with policy initiatives.
  * Handle exclusion scopes.
* Perform remediation in real time and on existing resources.
