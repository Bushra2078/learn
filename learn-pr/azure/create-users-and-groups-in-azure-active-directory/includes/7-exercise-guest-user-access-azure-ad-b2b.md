So the external and internal developer teams can work together, you decide to create guest user access for the external developer team. 

You'll use the Azure portal to invite B2B collaboration users. You can invite guest users to a directory, group, or application. After you invite a user, their account is added to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), with a guest user type.
