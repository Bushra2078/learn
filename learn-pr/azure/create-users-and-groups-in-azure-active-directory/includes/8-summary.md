In this module, you added a user and a group to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization that you created. You invited a guest user from an external development team so that your development team can collaborate with them. You added an enterprise application to your Azure AD organization and allowed a guest user to access that application.

Remember to clean up your resources after you've finished. Delete all of the users and applications you created during this module. You can't delete the tenant you created. If you don't use the tenant going forward, it'll automatically be deleted after a few months.

If you normally use a different Azure tenant, switch back to that tenant. In the upper-right corner of the Azure portal, select your profile. Sign in with a different account or, if your tenant is under the same account, select **Switch directory**. Under **All directories**, select the tenant you normally work in.
