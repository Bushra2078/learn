In this module, you've added a user and a group to a Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization that you created. You've invited a guest user from an external development team, so your development team can collaborate with them. You've added an enterprise application to your Active AD organization, and allowed a guest user to access that application.

Remember to clean up after you've finished. Delete all of the users and applications you created during this module.
