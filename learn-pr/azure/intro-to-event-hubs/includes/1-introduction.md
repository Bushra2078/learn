Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. Data can be ingested from a variety of sources, and distributed to multiple systems and Azure services.

Event Hubs is often called an ‘event ingestor’ and a ‘front door for event pipelines.’ Event Hubs provides a unified streaming platform to take data from wherever it’s created, to where you need it go – whether that’s for analytics, transaction process, archiving data, or more. Event hubs can be seamlessly integrated with other Azure and Microsoft services, such as Stream Analytics, Power BI and Event Grids, along with outside services like Apache Spark, to get the most out of your data.
