  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following are true about Event Hubs?'
    choices:
    - content: "Event Hubs provides an absolute guarantee of message delivery"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Event Hubs guarantees message caching, but responsibility to reading that cache falls to the consumer application."
    - content: "Event Hubs is well suited to situations where thousands of data sources submit information concurrently."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Event Hubs isn't suitable for load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. As cached messages can be pulled by multiple consumers, Event Hubs can help with load balancing."
  - content: 'What are consumer groups?'
    choices:
    - content: "Consumer groups are used to organize consumers but have no practical application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Consumer groups are identifiers applied to incoming messages to assign data to different partitions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Each consumer belongs to a single consumer group. Each consumer group has an independent offset and checkpoint for each partition."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'What is the main consideration for the ‘pull’ model provided by Event Hubs?'
    choices:
    - content: "Pull models make it the responsibility of the consumer(s) to ensure data are processed before they expire. This provides flexibility but also can mean that messages are lost in exceptional circumstances."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "This guarantees message delivery to consumers in a timely fashion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "The pull model can overload consumers by requiring too many requests be processed simultaneously during short periods of heavy traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The pull model allows consumers to process data at their own pace."
