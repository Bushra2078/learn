Protecting app secrets such as cryptographic keys and certificates is a critical step in protecting your data in the cloud. This is a core task of the security engineer and developer role - to properly architect the apps and data models to avoid data disclosure.

**Azure Key Vault** helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets that cloud applications and services use. Key Vault streamlines the key management process and enables you to maintain control of keys that access and encrypt your data. Developers can create keys for development and testing in minutes, and then migrate them to production keys. Security administrators can grant (and revoke) permission to keys, as needed.
