## Example scenario

Suppose you're responsible for deploying and configuring the Azure infrastructure at a toy company. You've built a Bicep template to deploy your company's website, which deploys an App Service app, a storage account for hosting product images, and a Cosmos DB database for product specifications. You've already created a pipeline that deploys your Azure resources by using your Bicep template. Now, you want to extend the pipeline to deploy your app and to seed some data you need for your website.
