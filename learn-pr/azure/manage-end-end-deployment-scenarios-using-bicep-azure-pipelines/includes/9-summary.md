You needed to update your toy company's website deployment pipeline so that it deployed more than just the Azure resources. You needed to deploy the website's code, and upload the product details and images.

In this module, you learned how to extend a Bicep deployment pipeline to perform these tasks and others. You learned about the differences between control and data plane operations, and some of the tools available to work with the data planes of various Azure services. You updated your website's pipeline to use these techniques.

Now, your website's deployment pipeline creates a working website for your team to use.
