You wanted to have an automated process to review any changes before they made it to the main branch of your project. In this module you learned how you could add workflows that trigger on pull request creation and synchronization. You also learned how you could make these status checks mandatory so users are not able to merge changes into the main branch in case these checks fail.

You also learned how you could create ephemeral environments that allow you to have a means of reviewing what will be deployed once changes make it to the main branch of your project. These environments allow contributors to try things out and iterate on their changes.

You also learned how to clean up these ephemeral environments in an automated way once a pull request is closed.

You now have much more confidence in the code that gets merged into your main branch.
