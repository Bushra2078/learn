## What Is It?

Depicted by a square, an external entity can be a process, data store, or even a full-fledged system outside of your direct control. Examples include:

- A user interacting with your service
- Tight integration with a third-party authentication service
- Services created by other teams within your organization

## When Should I Use the External Entity Element?

- Use this element to represent what you can't directly modify
- Data stores and external entities start the data-flow, so verify you have either one in place
