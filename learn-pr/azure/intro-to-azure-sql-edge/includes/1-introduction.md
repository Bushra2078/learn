The Internet of Things (IoT) offers many benefits to organizations and the users of their products and services. One benefit is the ability to collect data at your network edge, and use this data to detect important patterns, such as usage statistics. 

However, with increasing volumes of data, the challenge has been how to usefully gather this data; developers are looking for a platform that is powerful enough to ingest, store, and perform analytics on this collected data.

Azure SQL Edge is an IoT and IoT Edge optimized relational database engine. As indicated in the graphic, it can interact with components at the network edge, such as Edge Gateways, IoT Devices, and Edge Servers. 

Because Azure SQL Edge is based on the same engine and technologies as SQL Server, and supports the same tool sets, it can interact with SQL-based technologies, such as Azure SQL, and SQL Server.

## Example scenario

Let's imagine your organization is gathering data at the edge. You're having to manage increasing volumes of data being generated outside your organization and gathered by devices deployed to your edge network. Your developers must create apps that can collect, mine, and analyze this data. But you want to avoid your developers having to create new apps and code to perform these critical tasks. Perhaps you already have the necessary apps within your organization, running on SQL Server. 

It doesn't make sense to have to duplicate effort and create new apps on a proprietary system solely for the data arriving at the edge. By implementing Azure SQL Edge, you can avoid this need. Because it's based on the same codebase as Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Edge provides the same security, a familiar experience for your developers, and the same tool interfaces with which your developers are familiar. This enables you to get up to speed quickly and efficiently. 

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll evaluate whether Azure SQL Edge is appropriate for interaction with your apps and IoT devices at the edge. You'll also describe how Azure SQL Edge's familiar engine and toolset features enable you to optimize data ingest and analysis. You'll learn that Azure SQL Edge is: 

- Powerful enough to support edge compute.
- Secure enough to help meet the privacy needs of IoT applications.
- Compatible with a familiar ecosystem of products, tools, and services.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to determine how Azure SQL Edge and its familiar features can help you support the full range of IoT scenarios.
