Our goal was to help you decide if Azure SQL Edge is a good choice for your organization. To help guide your decision, we developed the following criteria:

- Connectivity and broadband limitations
- Latency
- Data security, privacy, and ownership
- Synchronization with and connectivity to backend systems
- Familiarity

We applied these criteria to your fictional organization, where your developers are creating and deploying IoT apps that can collect, mine, and analyze data from the edge. Azure SQL Edge is an IoT and IoT Edge optimized relational database engine that uses the same codebase as Microsoft SQL Server. Therefore, it provides the same security, a familiar experience for your developers, and the same tool interfaces with which your developers are familiar.

The criteria helped you decide that Azure SQL Edge is appropriate for interaction with your apps and IoT devices at the edge. You also learned how Azure SQL Edge's familiar engine and toolset features could enable you to optimize data ingest and analysis. You learned that Azure SQL Edge is:

- Powerful enough to support edge compute.
- Secure enough to help meet the privacy needs of IoT applications.
- Compatible with a familiar ecosystem of products, tools, and services.

You should now be able to determine how Azure SQL Edge and its familiar features can help you support the full range of IoT scenarios.
