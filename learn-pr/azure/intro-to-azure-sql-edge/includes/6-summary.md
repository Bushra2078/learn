Azure SQL Edge is an IoT and IoT Edge optimized relational database engine. Your developers are creating and deploying IoT apps that can collect, mine, and analyze data from the edge. Because Azure SQL Edge is based on the same codebase as Microsoft SQL Server, it provides the same security, a familiar experience for your developers, and the same tool interfaces with which your developers are familiar. 

You should consider using Azure SQL Edge when your IoT apps:

- Must  work both when connected to the internet and when offline.
- Are connected to the internet by slow or intermittent connections.
- Require near real-time response.
- Are operating in insecure environments, such as schools, factories, or vehicles.
- Must be able to comply with governmental data compliance regulations.
- Need to exchange data with systems such as Azure SQL Database, SQL Server, and Azure Cosmos DB.
- Are developed by people with skills in SQL Server and related technologies and tools.

In this module, you evaluated whether Azure SQL Edge is appropriate for interaction with your apps and IoT devices at the edge. You also described how Azure SQL Edge's familiar engine and toolset features could enable you to optimize data ingest and analysis. You learned that Azure SQL Edge is: 

- Powerful enough to support edge compute.
- Secure enough to help meet the privacy needs of IoT applications.
- Compatible with a familiar ecosystem of products, tools, and services.

You should now be able to determine how Azure SQL Edge and its familiar features can help you support the full range of IoT scenarios.
