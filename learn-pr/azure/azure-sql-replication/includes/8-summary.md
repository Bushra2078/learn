In this data replication module, you learned how to:

- Identify suitable Azure SQL Database data replication tools that fit your use case and business needs.
- Enable data replication tools on your Azure SQL Database.
- Monitor your deployments to ensure the data replication tools work successfully on your database.

As the CTO of your healthcare business, you are now equipped with the necessary knowledge to decide what tools to use in order to replicate data among your inventory databases across different regions. Moreover, you have the right skills to enable Change Data Capture (CDC), SQL Data Sync, or Change Tracking as needed on your tables and databases.

Congratulations!
