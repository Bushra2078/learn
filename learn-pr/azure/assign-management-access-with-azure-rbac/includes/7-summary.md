The large organization where you work needed to provide full subscription management access to a new member of staff, after a previous manager left the company.

In this module, you've considered the feature set and differences for two permission schemes you might see with Azure – Azure RBAC roles and Azure AD.

You've considered how to temporarily elevate your permissions as global AD administrator to take on the RBAC role of User Access Administrator – to provide full RBAC access at a particular scope to a new user.
