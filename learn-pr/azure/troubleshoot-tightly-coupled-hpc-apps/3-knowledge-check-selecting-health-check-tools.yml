  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: The HPC applications runs correctly on 64 HB120_v2, should they still run some health checks?
    choices:
    - content: There is no need; the application is running correctly.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. Even though the HPC applications runs correctly on 64 VMs and produces the correct output, that does not mean it's running optimally. A single unhealthy VM can have a significant impact on parallel performance.
    - content: You should only run health checks after every third deployment/
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. There is no guarantee that each deployment will land on the same physical hardware. You should always run health checks after every deployment.
    - content: Yes, you should still run some health checks.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You should always run health checks before running any HPC application, especially large tightly coupled HPC applications.
  - content: What is the recommended tool to check the health of the InfiniBand interconnect?
    choices:
    - content: Intel IMB-IMP1 PingPong built with HPCX.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Intel IMB-MPI1 built with HPCX is pre-loaded on HPC CentOS 7.7+ marketplace image and provides the best performance.
    - content: Intel IMB-IMPI1 PingPong contained in the Intel MPI environment on the CentOS-HPC 7.7+ Marketplace image.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. This version of IMB-IMP1 would work and measure InfiniBand latency/bandwidth, but other versions will measure more accurate and optimal InfiniBand latency/bandwidth.
    - content: HPL built with HPCX.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. The HPL benchmark is primarily used to measure the maximum FLOPS. It will indirectly also test the InfiniBand network, but other tests/tools would be better options.
  - content: What is the recommended tool to check the health of the VM's memory?
    choices:
    - content: IOR benchmark tool.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. The IOR benchmarking tool is used to benchmark synthetic I/O patterns, not memory bandwidth.
    - content: Intel IMP-IMP1 PingPong.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. The Intel IMP-IMP1 PingPong is used to measure network latency/bandwidth, not VM memory bandwidth.
    - content: Intel MLC.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The Intel Memory Latency Checker is an ideal tool to benchmark the maximum memory bandwidth, and thus determine the health of the VM memory.
