In this module, you learned how to identify unhealthy High Performance Computing (HPC) VMs by running several specific VM health checks, and how a single unhealthy VM can cause a tightly coupled HPC application for fail or run slower than expected. In addition, you learned how to prepare to run a tightly coupled HPC parallel application optimally, and how to troubleshoot slow running HPC applications.
