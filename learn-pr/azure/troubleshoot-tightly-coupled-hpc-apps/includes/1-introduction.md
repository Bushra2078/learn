Imagine that you work on an R&D team for a car manufacturer, and your team is using Azure High Performance Computing (HPC) resources to design and develop your new flagship sports car. Your team has created their tightly coupled HPC applications on Azure HPC SKUs; however, they observed a few problems when executing their HPC jobs in Azure. Some tightly coupled Message Passing Interface (MPI) jobs failed to run correctly, and others were performing slower than expected. Your R&D team will need to troubleshoot why some of their HPC applications are having run-time failures, and other HPC applications are performing below expectations.

In this module, you'll learn how to minimize the possibility of a run-time failure and troubleshoot underperforming tightly coupled HPC applications.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Troubleshoot run-time failures for tightly coupled HPC applications.
- Troubleshoot underperforming tightly coupled HPC applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of High Performance Computing (HPC) concepts.
- Familiarity with building and running tightly coupled HPC applications on Azure.
