Microsoft Defender for IoT is a passive, agentless solution for unified asset discovery and security monitoring across business-critical network environments. Defender for IoT is a network detection and response (NDR) solution purpose-built for discovering and securing IoT/OT devices. It leverages IoT/OT-aware behavioral analytics and threat intelligence. Defender for IoT goes beyond signature-based solutions to catch modern threats like zero-day malware and living-off-the-land tactics missed by static indicators of compromise (IOCs).

It ensures that OT and IT teams can easily and definitively auto-discover their unmanaged IoT/OT assets, identify connections, critical vulnerabilities, and detect anomalous or unauthorized behavior without impacting IoT/OT stability or performance.

## Flexible deployment 

Defender for IoT supports various deployment solutions:  


|Deployment solution  |Description |
|---------|---------|
|Air-gapped networks    | For air-gapped networks, Defender for IoT can be deployed fully on-premises and connected to an on-premises SEIM. Defender for IoT integrates with Microsoft Sentinel and an extensive range 3rd-party SOC tools (Splunk, IBM QRadar, ServiceNow, etc.).        |
|Hybrid deployments    |  On-premises sensors are managed locally and connected a cloud-based SIEM, for example Microsoft Sentinel.         |
|Cloud deployments    | Defender for IoT sensors VM or appliances are managed and connected to the Azure portal for cloud management and  integration with Microsoft Sentinel        |
