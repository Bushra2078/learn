Microsoft Defender for IoT provides security for business-critical infrastructures that run Operational Technology (OT) networks. It supports a digital transformation that bring OT and IT realities together to achieve common goals under shared governance, using mutual beneficial tools and technologies. Operational and security teams can have a holistic view of IT and OT assets and network zones. They will be able to monitor and protect the devices and systems in each zone, as well as the connections between them.


<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the real-world scenario you'll use to illustrate the product. Include 2-3 customer tasks that represent the most-common use cases for the product.

    Heading: "## Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company that is launching a new product. You sell the shoes on your website, manage your cloud-hosted advertising videos, and monitor social media to gauge reactions to the launch. The following illustration shows these processes. Notice how the tasks include both customer-facing processes like direct sales and administrative tasks like auto-archiving old videos. Here, you'll see how Logic Apps automates these types of business processes."

## Example scenario
Here youâ€™ll learn about the OT challenges that a building management company may deal with.

Suppose you own a smart building management company that is responsible for the daily, efficient functioning and safety of building services. Campuses in one city include 50 building that total 5 million square feet of residential space and 3 million square feet of office space.

The Chief Operations Officer  on the operational technology (OT) team is responsible for:  

- Reducing costs for maintaining skyscraper elevators  
- Increasing employee and machine productivity  
- Increasing safety against unauthorized guests 
- Enhancing services in conference rooms

To reach these goals, the Chief Operations officer installs new building management systems, CCTV cameras, conferencing equipment, intelligent HVAC systems, efficient elevator systems, and occupancy sensors. 

The Chief Security Officer indicates that these new technologies integrated with the current OT architecture have increased the security attack surface in the OT network. For example:  Networked elevator controls improve elevator usage, power consumption, and user experience, but introduces remotely accessible services which are easily penetrable.  

Both security and operation officers need visibility of:

- All equipment running in the operational network, including vendor-specific equipment that runs on proprietary protocols 
- Communications paths  between the various subsystems, as well as any unauthorized connections to the internet or corporate subnetworks. 

The teams would like to be alerted if unauthorized users take action or unplanned activities occur.  For example, if elevator controllers are reconfigured at an unplanned time or controllers monitoring fire detectors are accessed remotely, but remote access is unauthorized.  
 
Both teams need to respond to immediate threats and carry out ongoing operational and network security tasks, such as securing configurations of network switches, installing firmware updates on PLCs and security patches on BMS workstations
 
Currently the IT SOC team is working with standard security solutions but has no visibility into OT network assets, or connections, and cannot be alerted when equipment is compromised, updated at unplanned times, accessed without the right credentials, etc.

The OT team is managing its asset inventory using a computerized spread sheets and managing system architecture drawings using a CAD system. 

Information about dated firmware, OS versions, patch levels and, installed software and firmware is managed in communication between the vendor and OT staff.

## What will we be doing?

You'll analyze the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for IoT to help you decide when use it.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to decide whether Microsoft Defender for IoT is a good choice to provide security monitoring for your operational technology and IoT devices.
