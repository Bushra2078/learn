Now that you know what Defender for IoT is, let's discuss the scenarios best suited for this service.

## When to choose Defender for IoT

The following table describes business needs and applicable scenarios where Defender for IoT may be a good choice for an organization.

|Business need  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Device discovery**     | Defender for IoT's sensor console provides both a **Device inventory** page and a **Device map** page, which provide drill-down data on each of the OT/IoT devices in your network and the connections between them.      |
|**Manage network risks and vulnerabilities**     |  Defender for IoT's **risk assessment reports**, available from each sensor console, help you identify vulnerabilities in your network. <br><br>For example, reports can include unauthorized devices, unpatched systems, unauthorized internet connections, and devices with unused open ports.       |
|**Keep up to date with recent threat intelligence**     |  Make sure that sensors in your network have the most recent **threat intelligence (TI) packages** installed. <br><br>TI packages are provided by Defender for IoT's research team and include recent incidents of concern, common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), and new asset profiles.|
|**Manage sites and sensors**     | In fully on-premises environments, manage OT sensors in bulk using an on-premises management console. <br><br>However, you can also onboard OT sensors to the cloud and manage them from the Azure portal, on the **Sites and sensors** page.       |
|**Run guided investigations for OT entities**     |SOC teams can use the Microsoft Sentinel workbooks provided with the **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution to run investigations based on open incidents, alert notifications, and activities for OT assets. <br><br>The workbooks also provide a hunting experience across the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework for ICS, and are designed to enable analysts, security engineers, and MSSPs to gain situational awareness of OT security posture.         |
|**Automate remediation actions**     |    Use the Microsoft Sentinel playbooks provided with the **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution to run automated remediation actions as a routine.   |

## When not to choose Defender for IoT

Microsoft Defender for IoT isn't suited for devices that aren't connected to a network. Devices need to be connected to a network in order to be discovered by Defender for IoT sensors and have their traffic analyzed for security risks.

## Is Defender for IoT the right choice?

Let's reconsider our smart building management company from the first unit. The key points from that scenario were:

- Users include both security and operations teams, with officers from both teams needing access to security data
- Users must be able to view all equipment running on the network and communication paths between subsystems
- Users must be alerted about unauthorized actions or unplanned activities occurring on the network
- Users need tools to respond to immediate threats and carry out ongoing operational and network security tasks

Defender for IoT can support all these scenarios and would be a good choice for this organization.
