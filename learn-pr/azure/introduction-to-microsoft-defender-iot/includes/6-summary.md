Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Microsoft Defender for IoT is a good choice for your organization's OT/IoT device security.

Defender for IoT provides:

- Flexible deployment options, including cloud, on-premises, and hybrid models
- Agentless monitoring for OT/IoT devices that runs deep packet inspection on OT/IoT network traffic
- Machine learning engines that constantly analyze OT network traffic for anomalies, malware, and more
- Visibility across your sites, sensors, and device connections
- Risk assessment reports that help you identify vulnerabilities
- Continuous monitoring and threat intelligence updates
- Operational alerts that can also integrate directly with Microsoft Sentinel
- Extensibility for proprietary protocol support

In the case of Nuria's and Charlie's fictional building management company, the OT and SOC teams can use Defender for IoT to visualize, monitor, track, and respond to security alerts across their entire OT/IOT network.

The team can onboard device sensors to Defender for IoT from the Azure portal, and then track the sensor status directly from Azure.

From each sensor console, SOC teams can view the device inventory and device map to track network connections between devices, such as when implementing a Zero Trust policy.

Integrate with Microsoft Sentinel to visualize alerts together with security data from other sources and configure automated responses.

Using Microsoft Defender for IoT can help ensure that your OT/IoT device security remains up-to-date and cutting-edge as you move these devices and equipment to digital and cloud resources. Defender for IoT also provides extra automation and performance to help your operational and security teams running smoothly and efficiently.
