<!-- 1. Goal and criteria-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Recap that this module's goal is 'evaluate' using the provided decision criteria.

    Format: Short text followed by a bulleted list of the decision criteria developed in the "When to use (product)" unit.

    Heading: none

    Example: "Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Logic Apps would be a good choice for your business process. We developed some criteria you can use to guide your decision:
    * Integration
    * Performance
    * Conditionals
    * Connectors"

-->
Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Microsoft Defender for IoT is a good choice for your organization's OT/IoT device security.

<!-- 2. Show how you solved the scenario problem(s)---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Briefly summarize how you applied the decision criteria to the scenario problem(s). Ideally, discuss two scenarios, one where the product was appropriate and one where it wasn't.

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "We applied these criteria to our fictional shoe company. The analysis helped us see how difficult it would be to use Logic Apps for each process. Both the social-media monitor and the video archive utility used only the built-in connectors. This characteristic made them perfect for Logic Apps. The online sales portal required more work because it had complex conditionals and needed custom connectors."

Defender for IoT provides:

- Flexible deployment options, including cloud, on-premises, and hybrid models
- Agentless monitoring for OT/IoT devices that runs deep packet inspection on OT/IoT network traffic
- Machine learning engines that constantly analyze OT network traffic for anomalies, malware, and more
- Visibility across your sites, sensors, and device connections
- Risk assessment reports that help you identify vulnerabilities
- Continuous monitoring and threat intelligence updates
- Operational alerts that can also integrate directly with Microsoft Sentinel
- Extensibility for proprietary protocol support

In the case of Nuria's and Charlie's fictional building management company, the OT and SOC teams can use Defender for IoT to visualize, monitor, track, and respond to security alerts across their entire OT/IOT network.

The team can onboard device sensors to Defender for IoT from the Azure portal, and then track the sensor status directly from Azure.

From each sensor console, SOC teams can view the device inventory and device map to track network connections between devices, such as when implementing a Zero Trust policy.

Integrate with Microsoft Sentinel to visualize alerts together with security data from other sources and configure automated responses.

<!-- 3. Describe the business impact ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: explain how choosing the right product is important

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "The criteria help you evaluate whether your business processes are a good match for Logic Apps. First, they let you assess how well Logic Apps will solve your problem. Second, they give you an idea of the amount of customization effort involved in using them for your task. This process should give you enough information to choose the right product for your work."
 -->
Using Microsoft Defender for IoT can help ensure that your OT/IoT device security remains up-to-date and cutting-edge as you move these devices and equipment to digital and cloud resources. Defender for IoT also provides extra automation and performance to help your operational and security teams running smoothly and efficiently.
