### General guidance (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)
###  - Questions are complete sentences ending with a question mark
###  - No true/false questions
###  - 3 answers per question
###  - All answers about the same length
###  - Numeric answers listed in sorted order
###  - No "All of the above" and/or "None of the above" as answer choices
###  - No "Not" or "Except" in questions
###  - No second person ("you") in the questions or answers
###  - Provide a meaningful explanation for both correct and incorrect answers
###
### Question content requirements:
###  - Write 5 questions
###  - Questions 1,2 must test this Learning Objective: "Describe how (attributes) of (product) work to (solve problem)"
###      Guidance: These two questions can be short, no need for a long scenario to analyze. Test if they understand how the product works.
###      Example: "What differentiates an action from a control action in an Azure Logic App?"
###  - Questions 3,4,5 must test this Learning Objective: "Evaluate whether (product) is appropriate to (general product use case)"
###      Guidance: Use scenario questions that ask the learner to analyze a situation with the "when to use" criteria presented in the module.
###      Example: "Suppose you work for a financial company. You're building a system to let your brokers trade financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you'll have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?"

quiz:
  questions:
  - content: Which area in Defender for IoT in the Azure portal is the most seamless for SOC teams to use if they already use other Azure services and want to start integrating with Defender for IoT?
    choices:
    - content: "The Sites and sensors page"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Defender for IoT's Site and sensor page in the Azure portal will look familiar to experienced Azure users. The Site and sensors page displays all the customer's sensors currently on-boarded to Defender for IoT, and also provides links to onboard new sensors."
    - content: "Device inventory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The device inventory is currently available in general availability in the sensor console. While the sensor console's look and feel mimics that of the Azure portal, users must access the sensor console separately."
    - content: "Risk assessment reports"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Risk assessment reports are currently available only from the sensor console. While the sensor console's look and feel mimics that of the Azure portal, users must access the sensor console separately, and can't currently view reports directly in the Azure portal."
  - content: "Which of the following are examples of alerts triggered by Defender for Iot's *policy violation* detection engine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Software or firmware changes, or unauthorized PLC programming alerts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The policy violation detection engine triggers alerts for deviations in baseline behavior. For example, deviations might include unauthorized use of specific function codes, access to specific objects, or changes to device configuration."
    - content: Excessive SMB sign-in attempts or PLC scans
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Unusual machine-to-machine (M2M) communications and behaviors are detected by the *anomaly detection* engine. In contrast, the policy violation detection engine triggers alerts for deviations in baseline behavior. For example, deviations might include unauthorized use of specific function codes, access to specific objects, or changes to device configuration."
    - content: "Unresponsive devices or alerts about equipment failure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When a device is unresponsive and might be disconnected, alerts are triggered by the *operational incident detection* engine. In contrast, the policy violation detection engine triggers alerts for deviations in baseline behavior. For example, deviations might include unauthorized use of specific function codes, access to specific objects, or changes to device configuration."
  - content: "How can Defender for IoT support organizations that want to move their OT security systems to the cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Defender for IoT provides flexible deployment options in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can deploy Defender for IoT fully in the cloud, fully on-premises for an air-gapped environment, or in a hybrid deployment that matches your organization's needs. You can manage sensors from the Azure portal for cloud deployments, or from an on-premises management console for on-premises environments."
    - content: "Defender for IoT supports mostly on-premises deployments, with some site visibility from the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can extend Defender for IoT to the cloud in a hybrid deployment or deploy fully in the cloud."
    - content: "Defender for IoT is a cloud-only service with migration options from other on-premises services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you can deploy Defender for IoT in the cloud only, you can also deploy fully on-premises for an air-gapped environment, or in a hybrid deployment that matches your organization's needs."
  - content: "How can SOC teams use Defender for IoT together with other Azure services to secure network environments?"
    choices:
    - content: "SOC teams can use the integration between Defender for IoT and Microsoft Sentinel to run efficient security investigations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT solution in Microsoft Sentinel to view and analyze Defender for IoT alerts in Microsoft Sentinel. Use workbooks to visualize your data, analytics rules to trigger alerts, and playbooks to can automate system response."
    - content: "None. Microsoft Defender for IoT is a standalone service for OT/IoT device security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Defender integrates especially well with Microsoft Sentinel. You can use the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT solution in Microsoft Sentinel to view and analyze your Defender for IoT alerts in Microsoft Sentinel."
    - content: "SOC teams can use Azure Active Directory to secure day-to-date network access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Defender for IoT's strongest Azure integration is with Microsoft Sentinel. You can use the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT solution in Microsoft Sentinel to view and analyze your Defender for IoT alerts in Microsoft Sentinel, with workbooks that visualize your data, analytics rules, and playbooks that can automate system response."
  - content: "Hikaru works on a SOC team and is highly aware of the constantly changing security landscape. Hikaru is concerned about their organization's device security keeping up-to-date with the latest threats. How can Hikaru calm their concerns?"
    choices:
    - content: "Make sure that all network sensors are fully up-to-date with Defender for IoT's threat intelligence packages."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Defender for IoT's security research group, Section 52, ensures that customers have the most up-to-date threat intelligence (TI) packages. TI packages include the latest incidents of concern, common vulnerabilities and exposures, and more."
    - content: "Constantly read security news and then manually tweak sensor settings as needed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While personally keeping up-to-date with security news is always a good idea, Defender for IoT's Section 52 research team continuously curates threat intelligence packages for your network environments. Ensure your network security by keeping threat intelligence packages up-to-date on your network."
    - content: "Read through risk assessment reports"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While risk assessment reports help identify known vulnerabilities currently detected in your system, such as unauthorized devices, they won't include new risks and threats as the security landscape changes and evolves."
