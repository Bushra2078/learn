To determine if routing preference can realize cost savings for the factory network traffic project, you must first understand the routing preference alternatives in Azure.

When you create an internet facing service in Azure, such as an Azure Load Balancer, you assign a public IP address to the resource. When the public IP address is created, you have the option of keeping the default setting of **Microsoft network** or change the setting to **Internet**. These options for the public IP address determine the behavior of how traffic is routed from external user connections to the service in Azure.

As we learned from previous units, you have the option of routing traffic across the Microsoft global network or by the public internet. The following information explains how the traffic routes for the different routing preference options.

## Routing preference Microsoft network

The Microsoft network routing preference ensures all traffic whenever possible stays on the Microsoft network.

### Incoming (Ingress) traffic Microsoft network

The incoming data path uses **_cold potato routing_**. Cold potato routing means that traffic enters the Microsoft network that is closest to the user initiating the connection.

For example, if a user in Singapore accesses Azure resources hosted in the Central US region the traffic would enter the edge POP closest to Singapore. The traffic would then travel across the Microsoft backbone network to the service hosted in the Central US region.

### Outgoing (Egress) traffic Microsoft network

The outgoing traffic follows the same principle as the incoming traffic. Traffic traverses the Microsoft network and exits closest to the user's location.

For example, if traffic from the Central US region is destined to user in Singapore, the traffic travels the Microsoft network and exits the edge POP closest to Singapore.

## Routing preference Internet

The Internet routing preference minimizes data travel on the Microsoft global network.

### Incoming (Ingress) traffic Internet

The incoming data uses **_hot potato routing_**. Hot potato routing means that traffic enters the Microsoft network closest to the hosted service region.

For example, if a user in Singapore accesses Azure resources hosted in the Central US region the traffic would traverse the public internet and enter the edge POP closest to the Central US region.

### Outgoing (Egress) traffic Internet

The outgoing traffic follows the same principle as the incoming traffic. Traffic exits the Microsoft network in the same region where the service is hosted.

If a user in Singapore is the recipient of traffic from a service hosted in the Central US region, the traffic leaves the Microsoft network at the nearest edge POP to the Central US region. The traffic travels through the public internet to reach the user in Singapore.

> [!NOTE]
> Even when using a public IP address with a routing preference of **Internet**, all traffic that is bound for a destination within Azure continues to use the direct path within the Microsoft Wide Area Network.

## Routing preference unmetered

As we learned in the previous unit, the routing preference unmetered service is available for Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers who have their customers' origin content hosted on Azure.

Your outbound traffic from an origin in Azure destined to a CDN provider benefits from the direct connectivity. The data transfer bill for traffic leaving your Azure resources routed through the direct links is free.

A direct connection between a CDN provider and an origin in Azure enables optimal performance by eliminating network *hops* between the connections. The CDN workload that frequently fetches data from the origin benefits from the *hop* elimination.

With the service, CDN providers have the opportunity to directly connect their network to Microsoft's global network edge routers at various locations. To take advantage of Routing Preference unmetered, your CDN providers must be part of the program. Contact your CDN provider to check if it's part of the program.
