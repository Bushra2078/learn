  questions:
  - content: "A financial company has an application hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in the East US Azure region. They recently have seen a spike in cost of network traffic between their satellite office in the Western Europe Azure region and the application in the East US Azure region. They have determined that the application doesn't require high network performance or low latency. What routing preference should the financial company choose for their application's public IP address?"
    choices:
    - content: "The financial company should choose the Internet option."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The routing preference of Internet would fulfil the requirements of cost savings, as a majority of the traffic destined for and from an application or service in Azure uses the public Internet for the majority of the travel."
    - content: "The financial company should choose the Microsoft network option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The routing preference of Microsoft network would work for the application or service for the financial company, but doesn't fulfil the cost savings requirement. The majority of traffic will traverse the Microsoft network with this routing preference and would be subject to region egress costs."
