Now that the code is configured to generate an OpenAPI document file that describes the web API, the VanArsdel's development team's attention turns to publishing the application.


## Seamless development experiences in Visual Studio, from code to deploy ##

In a fusion development team, time is one of the most valuable assets. You write code and build an app, then use different tools to deploy your app. You come back to the coded, update it and switch to the other tools for deploy. The cost for switching between tools is huge, and eventually it will decrease your productivity.

What if your development tool, Visual Studio, can do everything for you in one place? It saves a lot of times and increases productivity. Visual Studio offers features to publish your app to Azure App Service.
