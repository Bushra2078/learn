While developing a web API application, it's important that developers keep their productivity without losing their cadences. Writing the application in Visual Studio and deploying it to Azure via a different tool may cause huge payout for context switching and diminish developers' productivity.

Visual Studio offers built-in features for seamless development experiences:

1. Publishing an ASP.NET Core Web API application to Azure App Service, and
2. Integrating it with Azure API Management.

Therefore, with these features, developers can:

* Deploy an ASP.NET Core Web API app to Azure App Service without needing to leave Visual Studio, and
* Integrate the Web API with Azure API Management without needing to leave Visual Studio.

To sum up, this module has covered the following topics:

* To activate OpenAPI feature on ASP.NET Core Web API,
* To publish the Web API app to Azure App Service through Visual Studio,
* To integrate the Web API app with Azure API Management through Visual Studio, and
* To verify the API through Azure API Management on Azure Portal.
