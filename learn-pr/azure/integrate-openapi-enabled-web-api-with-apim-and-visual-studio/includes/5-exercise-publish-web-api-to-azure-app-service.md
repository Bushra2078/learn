## Deploy Web API Application to Azure App Service through Visual Studio ##

After the previous exercise, the web API application is ready to publish. In order to deploy the web API application, run the following steps.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select the **Publish** menu.

1. In the **Publish** dialogue modal, select **Azure** and click the **Next** button. *(You may need to sign in to your Azure subscription first.)*

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-03.png" alt-text="Choose Publish Target.":::

1. Select **Azure App Service (Windows)** and click the **Next** button.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-04.png" alt-text="Choose Specific Target.":::

1. You could use an existing **Azure App Service** instance, if you like. However, let's create a new one through Visual Studio. Click the `âž•` button at the right-hand side of the dialogue modal to create a new **Azure App Service** instance.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-05.png" alt-text="Click Create New App Service.":::

1. When a new **App Service (Windows)** dialogue modal pops up, all field values have already been automatically populated. You can use the pre-populated ones or change them. Fill in all the field values and click the **Create** button.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-06.png" alt-text="Create New App Service.":::

1. Your new **Azure App Service** instance has been created. Click the **Next** button.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-07.png" alt-text="New App Service Created.":::

1. For now, we'll publish the web API app only to the **Azure App Service** instance. You can skip this step deploying to API Management for now. Check the **Skip this step** tick box and click the **Finish** button.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-08.png" alt-text="Finish New App Service.":::

1. Your web API app is ready to deploy. Click the **Publish** button at the right-top corner of Visual Studio.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-09.png" alt-text="Publish Web API.":::

1. Once the web API app is published, Visual Studio notifies you through a banner. Copy the website URL for later use.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-10.png" alt-text="Web API Published.":::


## Verify the web API application is running ##

1. In order to make sure your web API app is appropriately deployed, open your web browser and enter the website URL copied from the previous step. You will see the **Page Not Found** error, which is expected.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-11.png" alt-text="Page Not Found.":::

1. Change the URL to the following, and you will be able to see the Swagger UI page. If your copied website URL is `https://apiapp-inventorymanagement-kc.azurewebsites.net`, replace `<copied-website-url>` with it.

   ```text
   <copied-website-url>/swagger
   ```

1. Then, you will see the Swagger UI page rendered. Click the **/api/WarehouseLocations** banner to expand.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-12.png" alt-text="Swagger UI Page.":::

1. Click the **Try it out** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-13.png" alt-text="Swagger UI Page - Try It Out.":::

1. Click the **Execute** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-14.png" alt-text="Swagger UI Page - Execute.":::

1. Then, you will see the result.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-15.png" alt-text="Swagger UI Page - Executed.":::

Congratulations! You've now published your ASP.NET Core Web API app to Azure App Service through Visual Studio!
