In the previous module, you met VanArsdel Ltd's fusion development team. They're working on developing web APIs for inventory management. Crystal is the lead developer.

She and her development team have built web APIs for inventory management. She expects the web APIs are published to [Azure App Service][az appsvc] and integrated with [Azure API Management][az apim] through Visual Studio. At the end of the day, the development team pays the minimal switching cost between Azure API Management and Visual Studio during the development.

Throughout this module, you'll explore how Visual Studio can offer frictionless development experiences for web API application development from code to deploy.
