Kibana helps you visualize, present, and analyze the data in Elasticsearch. Recall that Tailwind Traders wants to offer analysts a visualization tool that allows them to gain deeper insights from their data. For this exercise, we'll walk through the steps of creating a demo environment using sample data that comes with Kibana, and point out some of the capabilities your team can experiment with to help inform their decision-making process.
