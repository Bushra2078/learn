Data visualization is a method for creating dashboards, reports, and real-time insights. Elastic Cloud offers a built-in visualization tool, Kibana, that deploys automatically. In the case of Trailwinds, you want to demo how analysts will be able to use Kibana to visualize data in Elastic. This unit walks through the basics steps on how to add a pre-loaded, sample data to Elastic so your teams can get started exploring.

## Kibana Canvas enables data visualization

Kibana is a window into the Elastic Stack for data consumers and operators of Elastic alike. Kibana Canvas, the name of the app itself, allows you to perform out-of-the-box Kibana data visualizing. Exploring Kibana Canvas provides a peek into the art of what is possible when it comes to visualizing data from Elasticsearch.

## Kibana alerts you to ML-based insights

Using the Kibana Alerting function, you can create Machine Learning jobs on the data in Elasticsearch and received notifications in your Kibana app of any interesting moments that the model detects.

## Kibana is accessed using your Elastic credentials

During unit 3 deployment exercise, you should have been prompted to copy or download a .csv file that includes your Elastic credentials and password. You will need these credentials to access Kibana. If you need to reset this password, you can at any time through the Elastic Search Console.
