Elastic Cloud on Azure provides a SaaS option that helps you get your search environment up and running in no time, while leaving infrastructure maintenance and stack configuration to the Microsoft and Elastic teams.

## Example scenario

Imagine you work for Tailwind Traders, an e-commerce retailer that runs its workloads and applications on Linux. The current search experience is backed by a SQL database. Customers have repeatedly reported slow search experiences and an inability to find relevant catalog items. The company would like to offer an improved search experience for customers and make it easier for analysts to view and explore inventory data.

You support these initiatives, but also recognize that adding more software and hardware systems isn’t realistic for your IT. You suggest Elastic Cloud on Azure, which provides Elasticsearch for the site search engine and Kibana for the built-in visualization service on the fully managed services of Microsoft Azure. Your boss asks you to create a working demo of the product complete with external sample data to show IT and business analysts.

## What will we be doing?

Through the course of this module, we’ll walk through how to launch Elastic Cloud on Azure and get Kibana running with a preloaded sample data set. You'll need to set up and use your own pay-as-you-go Azure subscription to participate in the exercises, which may incur a nominal fee. To keep costs low, you can either sign up for a free trial or set the VM to the smallest size and be sure to take it down when the exercise is over.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to deploy Elastic Cloud on Azure and add preloaded sample data in Kibana.
