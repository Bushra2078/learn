There are additional focused approaches you can use for your threat modeling exercise:

|Focused Approach|Definition|
|----------------|----------|
|Attacker|Evaluates attackers, their goals, and motivations. This approach assumes imposed risk and a breached mentality|
|Asset|Evaluates risk for each asset. This approach identifies critical assets based on things like classified data handling and focuses mostly on protecting those assets|

The system focused approach incorporates a few of the other approaches, but you may want to do try them individually to get more granular results.
