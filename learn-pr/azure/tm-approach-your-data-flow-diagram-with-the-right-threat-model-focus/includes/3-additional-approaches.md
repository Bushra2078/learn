There are additional approaches you can use for your threat modeling exercise:

- **Attacker** - Evaluates attackers, their goals, and motivations. This approach assumes imposed risk and a breached mentality
- **Asset** - Evaluates risk for each asset. This approach identifies critical assets based on things like classified data handling and focuses mostly on protecting those assets.

The system focused approach incorporates a few of the other approaches, but you may want to do try them individually to get better results.
