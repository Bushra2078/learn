The system-focused approach provides a framework to help analyze the system and how it affects other assets, which include:

|Asset Type|Examples|
|----------|--------|
|Logical|Source code, APIs, and logical security controls|
|Physical|Servers and physical security controls assets|

Authenticating your users with Azure is a good thing. Understanding how it works and interacts with each part of the system is better and avoids creating unknown risk post-deployment.

After all, the goals of threat modeling are to validate assumptions previously made, identify potential threats, and reduce risk earlier in the development lifecycle.
