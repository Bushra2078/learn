Threat modeling is an effective technique to help you identify threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk. We start by deciding to focus on either **what** needs to be protected or **who** it needs protection from.

In this module, you explored what it means to conduct a system focused threat modeling exercise. You also learned the difference between system, asset, and attacker focused approaches.

You learned:

- What a system focused threat modeling means
- The differences between the system, asset, and attacker focused approaches
