Threat modeling is an effective technique to help you identify threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk. You can focus on identifying what needs to be protected, or how an attacker could operate in the system.

You explored what it means to conduct a system-focused threat modeling exercise. You also learned the difference between system-, asset-, and attacker-focused approaches.

In this module, you:

- Defined a system-focused threat-modeling exercise
- Explained the high-level differences between the system-, asset-, and attacker-focused approaches
