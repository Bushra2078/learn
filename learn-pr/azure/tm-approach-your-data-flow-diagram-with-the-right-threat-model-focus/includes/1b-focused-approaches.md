Threat modeling is a great technique to help you find issues earlier in the development lifecycle. 

Choosing the right focused approach helps you tailor the threat modeling exercise to help you find more actionable threats and ways to solve them.

With the system focused approach, your goal is to protect the entire system. You look at each process, data store, data-flow, external entity, and trust boundary to apply the right security controls and protect your system.

With the attacker focused approach, you emphasize the attacker, their motive, means and all the ways they can wreak havoc in your system. The main difference is that this approach tends to look at specific entry points, rather than the entire system as a whole.
