## What it is about

Threat modeling is an effective technique to help you identify threats and find ways to reduce or eliminate risk. 

The process begins when you decide whether to focus on what needs to be protected or who it needs protection from.

## Why is it important?

Having the right focus helps you tailor the threat modeling exercise to produce quality results. Examples include:

- Designing a file sharing application and focusing on protecting its processes, data stores and data-flow
- Designing a file sharing application and focusing on learning more about the attacker, their motives and means to target your application

In this module, you'll explore what it means to conduct a system focused threat modeling exercise. 

You'll also learn the high-level differences between system, asset, and attacker focused approaches.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will be able to:

- Define a system focused threat modeling exercise
- Explain the high-level differences between the system, asset, and attacker focused approaches

## Prerequisites
