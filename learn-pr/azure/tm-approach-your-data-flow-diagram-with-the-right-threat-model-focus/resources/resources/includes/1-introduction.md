Threat modeling is an effective technique to help you identify threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk. We start by deciding to focus on either **what** needs to be protected or **who** it needs protection from.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft engineers focus on protecting the system. Penetration testing teams focus on both protecting the system and understanding the attacker.

In this module, you'll explore what it means to conduct a system focused threat modeling exercise. You'll also learn the high-level differences between system, asset, and attacker focused approaches.
