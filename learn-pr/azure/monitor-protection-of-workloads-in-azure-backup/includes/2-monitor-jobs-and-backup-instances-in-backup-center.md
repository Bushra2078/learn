The Backup center is a single pane of glass that helps you to monitor the jobs and back up inventory on a day-to-day basis besides performing various regular operations, such as responding to on-demand backup requests, restoring backups, creating backup policies, and so on. Now, you can also use Backup center to monitor your jobs and replication inventory as a disaster recovery admin.

## Monitor backup jobs

By using the Backup center, you can view detailed information on all the jobs that were created in your backup estate and take appropriate action for the failing jobs. You can select an item in the grid to view more details about a specific job. Right-click an item to go to the resource to take the necessary actions.
