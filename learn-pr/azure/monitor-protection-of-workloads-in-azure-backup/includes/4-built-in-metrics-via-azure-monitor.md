Azure Backup provides a set of built-in metrics via Azure Monitor that enables you to monitor the health of your backups. It also allows you to configure alert rules that trigger when the metrics exceed defined thresholds.

Azure Backup offers the following key capabilities:

- Ability to view out-of-the-box metrics related to back up and restore health of your backup items along with associated trends
- Ability to write custom alert rules on these metrics to efficiently monitor the health of your backup items
- Ability to route fired metric alerts to different notification channels supported by Azure Monitor, such as email, ITSM, webhook, logic apps, and so on.
