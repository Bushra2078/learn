You've created a deployment pipeline. When you run the pipeline, it fails when it reaches the **Deploy** stage.

You see an error in the pipeline log that's similar to the following:

> "The provided location is not available for this resource type."

You fix the problem in your Bicep file by changing the `location` property of the resource, and you re-run the pipeline successfully.
