      What could you do to minimize the chance of this error happening again?
    choices:
    - content: Add an approval check to the pipeline.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. An approval check enables you to manually verify the status of your environment or pipeline, but it doesn't help to reduce the chance of an invalid template being submitted to Azure.
    - content: Run preflight validation within your pipeline.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The preflight validation process performs validation of your template. It reports errors that prevent the template deployment from being submitted to Azure.
    - content: Add a rollback stage to your pipeline.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can add a rollback stage to reverse the effects of a stage that's failed, but it doesn't help to validate the Bicep file you submit.
  - content: Your operations team asks you to verify that a database server deployed by the pipeline is configured to accept requests. Which of the following actions would meet this requirement?
    choices:
    - content: Run the Bicep linter within your pipeline.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While the Bicep linter is useful, it doesn't tell you whether your Azure resources are configured according to your requirements.
    - content: Add the what-if operation to your pipeline.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While the what-if operation is useful, it doesn't tell you whether your Azure resources are configured according to your requirements.
    - content: Add an approval check to the stage after the deployment completes.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A human can verify the configuration of your environment after deployment and then approve the continuation of the pipeline. You could also consider running an automated smoke test.
  - content: Which of these statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: The Bicep linter needs to be installed separately to Bicep.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Bicep linter is part of the Bicep tooling, and it runs automatically when you build or deploy a Bicep file.
    - content: A template with no linting warnings or errors is guaranteed to deploy successfully.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The linter runs some basic code style checks. Your template might lint successfully but not deploy.
    - content: Linting ensures that your Bicep file meets a minimum code style quality level.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The linter doesn't verify that your file will deploy successfully, but it checks that your Bicep file follows some basic code style rules.
