You're part of a development team at the company Tailwind Traders. As part of that work you need to author ARM templates to deploy and manage resources in the cloud. You want to ensure the templates follow some sounds practices before it's deployed. You therefore elect to use the ARM template test toolkit to help you analyze your templates, so you can rectify any problems. 

## Set up your testing environment

The tool is a PowerShell script. To be able to run it, you would need to go through the following steps:

- **Install the PowerShell Core**, this task is done differently depending if you are on Linux, Mac, or Windows.
- **Download the script**. The script is hosted in a GitHub repository and can be downloaded from there or fetched via a `git clone` command.
- **Import the script**. This step is just a one-liner instruction that you enter in a terminal window.

### Install PowerShell

::: zone pivot="linux"

[!include[](./os/5-exercise-test-toolkit-linux.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="macos"

[!include[](./os/5-exercise-test-toolkit-macos.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="windows"

[!include[](./os/5-exercise-test-toolkit-windows.md)]

::: zone-end

Now you are ready to run the tests on your template.
