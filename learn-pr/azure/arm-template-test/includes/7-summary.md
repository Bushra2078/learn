In this module, you were introduced to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template test toolkit. The test toolkit validates your deployment templates by comparing them to tried and tested best practices. It then indicates where you're in violation. The ARM template test toolkit isn't something you *must* abide by. It's just recommendations.

You also learned how to implement domain-specific rules by authoring and running custom tests for the ARM template test toolkit.

You should now have a good understanding of what scripts and tools can help you during the development process of your deployment templates.
