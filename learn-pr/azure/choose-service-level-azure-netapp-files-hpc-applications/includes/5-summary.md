In this module, we'll help you choose the best Azure NetApp Files service level for your EDA and HPC applications.

We'll review the storage hierarchy of Azure NetApp Files and examine the key factors that determine Azure NetApp Files performance, such as service level and volume quota. We'll also learn how to calculate the required bandwidth of your applications. And we'll consider the service-level cost structure.

After we've identified the throughput or IOPS requirements of the application, we'll be able to choose the best service level. The Azure NetApp Files Performance Calculator is the tool we'll use to achieve this goal.
