  questions:
  - content: "Which key component of Kubernetes does Azure Arc-enabled data services use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Kubernetes API"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "All services use one of the key components of the Kubernetes platform, the Kubernetes API"
    - content: "az CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "az CLI is not a key component of Kubernetes"
    - content: "kubectl"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "kubectl is a tool used with Kubernetes but is not a key component used by Azure Arc-enabled data services"
    - content: "Azure Arc Agents"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Arc Agents are deployed on the Kubernetes cluster but not a component of Kubernetes"
  - content: "Which connected mode supports the Azure Resource Manager?"
    choices:
    - content: "indirect connected mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "indirect connected mode cannot use the Azure Resource Manager. You cannot use tools like the Azure portal to deploy or manage Azure Arc-enabled data services"
    - content: "direct connected mode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "With direct connected mode, users can use the Azure Resource Manager through the az CLI and Azure Portal"
    - content: "azure connected mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The only connected mode options are direct or connected"
  - content: "The Azure Arc data controller requires a Kubernetes cluster to be connected to Azure"
    choices:
    - content: "true"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure Arc data controller can be deployed in indirect connected mode which does not require the Kubernetes cluster to be connected to Azure"
    - content: "false"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An Azure Arc data controller can be deployed in indirect connected mode which does not require the Kubernetes cluster to be connected to Azure"
  - content: "What component coordinates Azure Resource Manager requests to deploy and manage Azure Arc-enabled data services on Kubernetes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Arc data controller"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure Arc data controller coordinates only within in the Kubernetes cluster"
    - content: "Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure portal is an interface that uses the Azure Resource Manager"
    - content: "Azure Arc resource providers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Arc resource providers will coordinate this request with Azure Arc agents and the Azure Arc data controller in the Kubernetes cluster to complete the deployment of Kubernetes pods and services"
    - content: "az CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The az CLI is an interface that uses the Azure Resource Manager"
