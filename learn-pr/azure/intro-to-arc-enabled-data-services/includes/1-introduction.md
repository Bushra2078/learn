# Introduction

Many professionals and business are today looking to invest in cloud services, especially when it comes to data. Cloud services often can provide managed capabilities to lower total cost of ownership and provide more redundancy, reliability and efficiency for applications.

Some organizations are not yet in a position to completely deploy databases and applications in public cloud systems like Azure. For various reasons, from compliance standards to a desire for more control or choice, they want the power of Azure managed data services while maintaining ownership of infrastructure on-premises or other public cloud systems.

Azure Arc-enabled data services is designed to make it possible to run Azure managed data services in the infrastructure of your choice using the power of Kubernetes.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
