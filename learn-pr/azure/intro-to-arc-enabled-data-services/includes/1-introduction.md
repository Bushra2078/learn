Many professionals and businesses are today looking to invest in cloud services, especially when it comes to data. Cloud services often can provide managed capabilities to lower total cost of ownership and provide more redundancy, reliability, and efficiency for applications.

Some organizations aren't yet in a position to completely deploy databases and applications in public cloud systems like Azure. For various reasons: from compliance standards, wish for more control, or choice, they want the power of Azure-managed data services while maintaining ownership of infrastructure.

Azure Arc-enabled data services are designed to make it possible to run Azure-managed data services in the infrastructure of your choice using the power of Kubernetes. Azure Arc-enabled data services include Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance and Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale (Preview).

In this module you will learn the fundamentals of hybrid computing, Azure Arc, and Azure Arc-enabled data services. You will learn the architecture of Azure Arc-enabled data services and how various components and tools interact with Azure and Kubernetes. You will also learn the capabilities, features, and interfaces of Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance and Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale.
