# Hybrid Computing Defined
Hybrid computing connects on-premises systems to one or more public-cloud systems. Hybrid computing provides a single application experience along with simple deployment, governance, and management. Hybrid computing gives you the ability to use current on-premises investments. This environment places data close to compute systems for the best performance. With hybrid computing, you get uniform security, a unified billing, management, data collection, and reporting system.
# Considerations for Effective Hybrid Computing
While hybrid computing offers many benefits, there are considerations for combining multiple computing environments. 
## Deployment
Hybrid Computing works best with a declarative, stateful method of deployment.  Using a manifest describing the required state of your hybrid environment allows you to check the state of the system into source-control. This gives you an optimized DevOps cycle, along with point-in-time configuration snapshots. 
## Governance
Governance is the process of monitoring and controlling information technology to ensure the delivery of value to stakeholders in an organization. The first step in governance of a hybrid system is ensuring a consistent, updated state of deployment. Updates should be applied in a tested, automated fashion through standard DevOps practices. 
Another important factor in the governance of a hybrid computing system is ensuring security and compliance. Hybrid computing systems need pro-active monitoring, reporting, and a process for correcting issues. There are also regulatory statutes required by government and industry. This level of security and compliance requires "zones" for the storage processing of sensitive data. Hybrid computing systems also need a consistent and cohesive auditing mechanism to ensure compliance. 
## Management
Management for hybrid computing environment should be as consistent and comprehensive as possible, using both scripted and exploratory (graphical interface) tools.  These tools should work on all components in the system and completely cover the DevOps cycle. 
Hybrid computing systems may not always be connected. The management and control of the system should allow for both direct (connected) and indirect (periodically connected) aspects, without materially affecting the operation of the tools. 

# Microsoft Azure Arc and Hybrid Computing Systems
Microsoft provides several environments for working with hybrid computing environments, such as:
 - Azure hybrid cloud solutions
 - Azure hybrid benefit
 - Azure Defender
 - Azure VMware solution
 - Azure Stack
 - Azure Sentinel
 - Azure VPN Gateway
 - Azure ExpressRoute
 - Azure Arc
Microsoft Azure Arc meets the requirements for a Hybrid computing environment. It provides tools for deployment, monitoring and management of your infrastructure. Microsoft Azure Arc also gives you deployment options for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Kubernetes clusters. Microsoft Azure Arc allows you to combine on-premises and multi-cloud services.
## Azure Arc Enabled Servers
Azure Arc enabled servers expands support to server-based resources that run outside of Azure. You can register a Windows or Linux server running in an on-premises data center with Azure Arc and use many of the resource management capabilities available on Azure. You can use a Windows or Linux server hosted by another cloud provider for your deployment.
## Azure Arc Enabled Kubernetes
Using Azure Arc, organizations can connect Kubernetes clusters located anywhere to Azure. You can manage clusters in a consistent way. Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes lets you control the cluster configuration and workloads at scale, using git repositories for the clusters. It also lets organizations use management capabilities in Azure for cluster management needs such as inventory, monitoring, policy compliance, security, user access, and more.
## Azure Arc enabled SQL Servers
Azure Arc enabled SQL Servers extends Azure services to SQL Server instances hosted outside of Azure in the customerâ€™s datacenter, on the edge, or in a multi-cloud environment.
## Azure Arc Enabled Data Services
Azure Arc Enabled Data Services makes it possible to run Azure data services such as SQL Server-Managed Instance and PostgreSQL Hyperscale. You can run these systems on-premises, at the edge, in Azure and in other public clouds. 
Using Kubernetes allows you to use the infrastructure of your choice. You get an always-current, elastically scaled, self-provisioning deployment. You also get a unified command-line and graphical management and monitoring system. Azure Arc Enabled Data Services has both direct and indirect connected modes. 
Azure Arc Enabled Data Services also provides deep security and compliance monitoring.
