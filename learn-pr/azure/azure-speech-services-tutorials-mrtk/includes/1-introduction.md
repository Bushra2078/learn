We will create a Mixed Reality application that explores the use of Azure Speech Services with the HoloLens. The Speech service is the unification of speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech translation into a single Azure subscription.

Imagine a scenario where you are expected to build an application capable of translating your speech into other languages. It would be best if you had a brief overview of incorporating that feature in your application. Azure Speech Services helps you in similar functions.

We will use your device's microphone to transcribe speech to text in real-time on completing this module series. In addition, translate our speech into other languages and leverage the Intent recognition feature to understand voice commands using artificial intelligence.
