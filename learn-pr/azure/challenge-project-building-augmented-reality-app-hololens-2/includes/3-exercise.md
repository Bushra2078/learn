**App Description:**

You will conceptualize and develop an app that leverages the capabilities of the HoloLens 2. The app should provide a valuable and engaging experience to its users. The project offers flexibility in choosing the app domain, whether it is education, healthcare, gaming, engineering, or any other relevant field. You should define the purpose, features, and target audience of the app.

Galaxy Explorer Example:

Galaxy Explorer is an educational application built for the HoloLens 2 to inspire and educate people about the galaxy. By using spatial technology, a person can see the entire galaxy in the room they are in. The app will provide 3D models of planets, allow users to navigate through space, and offer educational information about each celestial body.

This app will be supported on the following platforms:

- HoloLens 2
- HoloLens (1st gen)
- Windows Mixed Reality Headsets (VR)
- Windows 10 Desktop

**Storyboard for the App:**

Create a detailed storyboard that outlines the user experience and interaction flow of the app. Storyboarding helps visualize the different stages and screens within the app, showcasing how users will navigate and engage with the MR elements. The storyboard should demonstrate a logical progression and highlight key interactions, interfaces, and functionalities. Think of a storyboard as a low-fidelity comic book with panels that show how a user will use your app and the things they will do. It won't be comprehensive, but should convey the structure of your app.

Galaxy Explorer Example:

A storyboard will consist of how many panels you will need to convey what the project is and the needs to detail interaction, etc. Most storyboards start with the initial screen as you see in this image:

Notice that it is not a finished rendering of the initial experience but gives an idea of what you will first see in the Galaxy Explorer app with just enough fidelity. That way if you are having stakeholders review it, any changes won't be costly as your only dealing with mock-ups of the user interface.

Another type of panel within your storyboard will be where you can explore interactions you may want to include. For example, in this image, you can again see we are not looking at a full-fidelilty end-result, but an exploration of an interaction.

There are many tools from PowerPoint to Figma that make it very easy to create storyboards for your project that you can use, but even pencil and paper make for a great tool to create storyboards.
