**Development Workflow:**

Provide a detailed plan outlining the development workflow, including milestones, timelines, and allocated resources. Utilize appropriate software development methodologies such as Agile and define roles and responsibilities within the development team. Track progress, conduct regular meetings, and adapt the workflow as needed.

Galaxy Explorer Example:

The Galaxy Explorer app took six weeks of core development and two weeks of refinement. The team comprised of:

- Producer responsible for planning, reviewing progress, and keeping things progressing.
- A design director and senior designer responsible for the creative vision.
- Three developers who figured out the technical solutions.
- Four artists consisting of a concept artist, a modeler, technical artist and animator.
- One full time tester who tested builds daily, set up build reviews and reviewed features.

Note: you may not have a full studio team, but may find ways to find substitutes such as using free [Unity Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/) instead of having a modeler on your team.

There are many project planning templates and tools you can use that are free. The Galaxy Explorer team spent a considerable amount of time (weeks) to work through their project plan before writing production code. What about the developers, were they just sitting around waiting for planning and design? No. They're part of the planning and design process and were prototyping interactions. This integration ensures the designs were able to be reflected within the code and app.

**App Prototype:**

Develop a functional prototype of the HoloLens 2 app. Utilize the appropriate software development tools and frameworks, such as Unity 3D and the HoloLens development kit. The prototype should demonstrate the core functionalities of the app and showcase the integration of mixed reality elements. Test and refine the prototype based on user feedback to ensure a polished user experience.

Galaxy Explorer Example:

The Galaxy Explorer app code and documentation can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/GalaxyExplorer). Feedback can be provided as a GitHub issue and allowing open source contributions from folks who fork the code and issue a pull request.
