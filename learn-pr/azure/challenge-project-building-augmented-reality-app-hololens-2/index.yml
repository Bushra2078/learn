  Challenge project - Building an Augmented Reality app for HoloLens 2
summary: |
  Take a guided tour with the help of a sample app to build an app end-to-end.
  > [!NOTE]
  > This is a **_Challenge Project_** module where you complete an end-to-end project using high-level guidance; there are no step-by-step instructions.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll demonstrate your ability to:
    - Understand the fundamentals of mixed reality and its applications.
    - Gain knowledge of HoloLens 2 hardware and software.
    - Develop proficiency in 3D spatial mapping and tracking.
    - Learn to implement gesture recognition and spatial sound.
    - Acquire skills in designing user interfaces for MR applications.
    - Apply advanced MR development techniques using HoloLens 2.
    - Demonstrate the ability to develop a functional HoloLens 2 application through an end-to-end project.
    - Understand the fundamentals needed for a project document for your prototype.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The project will include a functional app prototype that is ready for the Microsoft Store. The intention isn't a hands-on tutorial with code included of building an app, but the holistic approach to building an app end-to-end.
    > Also, the other deliverable in addition to the prototype will be a project document.
