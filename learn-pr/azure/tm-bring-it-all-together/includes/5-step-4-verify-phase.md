## Check Fixes and Assumptions

Use each unit in this module to make sure each assumption, requirement, issue, and security control has been addressed.

Verification can be done manually, automatically or both. The process can be enforced before each deployment or across time intervals, such as every 6-12 months. The process cadence depends on:

- **System** - Will my system be used externally? Does it handle confidential data? Do I have to comply with regulations?
- **Organization** - Does my organization require additional security factors, such as privacy implications, operational risk, or development requirements?
