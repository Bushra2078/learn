Threat modeling is a required task of the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). When done correctly, it helps engineers avoid critical issues earlier in the development phase, when fixes are less costly and easier to implement.

This module summarizes important and helpful tips from previous modules to help you create quality threat models.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll review:

- **Design** - Including the appropriate context and requirements for your data-flow diagram
- **Break** - Using the right focused threat modeling approach, framework and context depth layer
- **Fix** - Prioritizing issues and applying a good mix of security controls
- **Verify** - Ensuring the work gets completed

## Prerequisites

Complete all modules under the **Threat Modeling Fundamentals Learning Path**:

- Introduction to Threat Modeling
