## Access control

![Access Control category](../media/AccessControl.svg)

### Why ask these questions

These questions allow you to:

- Know who is authorized to access enterprise resources, like admins, vendors, or users.
- Understand what is required to restrict access, like Role-based Access Control (RBAC), Access Control Lists (ACL), or least-privilege access.
- Investigate identity management systems used, like Azure Active Directory (AAD).
- Learn what is used to authenticate, like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), or Single-Sign-On (SSO).
