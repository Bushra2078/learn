![Secure Development category](../media/SecureDevelopment.svg)

### Why ask these questions

These questions allow you to:

- Understand how engineering teams enforce security throughout the development lifecycle, like security reviews, threat models, security tools, or code reviews.
- Learn the systems used to protect source code and security bugs.
