Infrastructure threat modeling uses a data-flow diagram to show how data flows in the enterprise. It also shows how it's protected at each stage in the lifecycle.

In this module, you:

- Understood the importance of a well defined, open-ended questionnaire to get a better view of the infrastructure.
- Visualized how each component interacts with the other with a detailed data-flow diagram.
- Identified infrastructure security risks using a combination of security policy gaps and the threat modeling framework.
- Reduced or eliminated risks with known security requirements and controls.
