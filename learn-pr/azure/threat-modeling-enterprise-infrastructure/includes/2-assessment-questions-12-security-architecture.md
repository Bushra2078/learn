![Security architecture category](../media/SecurityArchitecture.svg)

### Why ask these questions

These questions allow you to:

- Learn how technologies are selected, implemented, and managed.
- Find out collaboration requirements that prevent external data sharing, including social media.
- Understand how resiliency and security are achieved.
- Meet who creates and manages security baselines across platforms.

### What questions to ask

|Question|Areas to cover|
|--------|--------------|
|**Describe your infrastructure.**|<ul><li>Whether the infrastructure is on-premises, cloud-based, or a hybrid of both.</li><li>Software usage restrictions.</li><li>Baselines used to provide acceptable levels of security across different platforms and operating systems.</li></ul>|
|**Describe your container and/or IoT infrastructure.**|<ul><li>Use of IoT and/or containers.</li><li>Security controls used for network access, device configuration, and data handling.</li><li>Security requirements for containers as they relate to containerization and orchestrators.</li></ul>|
|**In addition to what has already been discussed in previous categories, what other security controls are implemented?**|<ul><li>Additional access controls used to secure the infrastructure, especially hybrid or cloud-based scenarios.</li><li>Additional hardware tracking mechanisms used across data-centers.</li><li>Additional backup mechanisms in place.</li><li>Additional network security controls.</li><li>Additional testing and monitoring systems used, especially in hybrid or cloud-based scenarios.</li><li>Additional data handling processes.</li></ul>|
