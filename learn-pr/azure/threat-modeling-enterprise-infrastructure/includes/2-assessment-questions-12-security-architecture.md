## Security architecture

![Security architecture category](../media/policies/security-architecture.png)

### Why ask these questions

These questions allow you to:

- Learn how technologies are selected, implemented, and managed.
- Find out collaboration requirements that prevent external data sharing.
- Understand how resiliency and security are achieved.
- Meet who creates and manages security baselines across platforms.

### What questions to ask

|Question|Areas to cover|
|--------|--------------|
|**Describe your infrastructure.**|<ul><li>Learn if the infrastructure is on-premises, cloud-based, or a hybrid of both.</li><li>Software usage restrictions.</li><li>Baselines used to provide acceptable levels of security across different platforms and operating systems.</li></ul>|
|**Describe your infrastructure for containers and IoT devices.**|<ul><li>Use of IoT and containers.</li><li>Security controls used for network access, device configuration, and data handling.</li><li>Security requirements for containers as they relate to containerization and orchestrators.</li></ul>|
|**Define other security controls for hybrid case scenarios**|<ul><li>Access controls used to secure the infrastructure, especially hybrid or cloud-based scenarios.</li><li>Hardware tracking mechanisms used across data-centers.</li><li>Back up mechanisms in place.</li><li>Network security controls.</li><li>Testing and monitoring systems used, especially in hybrid or cloud-based scenarios.</li><li>Data handling processes.</li></ul>|
