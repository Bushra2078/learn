Azure Databricks provides several built-in functions to represent your data. It also allows integraion with a power BI tool such as Power BI to visualize your data in an easy to understand format.

## Built-in functions

Databricks provides easy-to-use, built-in function `display` for visualizations of your data. You can use this function directly with DataFrame and derive required results using `filter` and `select` expressions.

## Visualizing with Power BI

You can connect your Databricks cluster to Power BI to create visualization for your data. Once you have established a connection, you can simply use the Power BI application to pull your analysis data from your cluster and create the reports in the required format.

## Visualizing with Matplotlib

Azure Databricks supports 3rd party Matplotlib library to expand your options for creating useful visualizations in Azure Databricks. You can display Matplotlib libraries within a Python notebook in Azure Databricks. Databricks saves plots as images in The FileStore. The results can be displayed as box plots or heat map. Matplotlib allows you to represent your data in a grouped bar chart form and gives you many options for customizing the color and even texture of chart elements.
