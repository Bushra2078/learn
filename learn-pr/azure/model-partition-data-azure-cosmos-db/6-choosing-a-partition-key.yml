    - content: "Storage and throughput"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Hot partitions can occur on both storage and throughput, preventing your database from being able to scale."
    - content: "Compute and storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hot partitions can occur on storage but they indirectly affect compute."
  - content: "When designing for write-heavy workloads, how should writes be distributed?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Across many partition key values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Spread requests as evenly as possible across partition key values by using a unique partition key like customer ID."
    - content: "On one partition key value"
      isCorrect: false
