  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "For a NoSQL database, how should unbounded 1:Many relationships be modeled?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Saved as separate documents and referenced"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Where the 1:Many relationship is unbounded or can grow large, data should be referenced."
    - content: "Stored in separate containers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Cosmos DB does not support relational constraints between containers."
    - content: "Embedded in the same document"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data where the relationship is 1:1 or 1:Few is a better candidate for embedding."
  - content: "How does embedding data into the same document affect performance or costs?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Increase latency and lower cost"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Embedding data to reduce the number of requests can lower costs, but it doesn't increase latency."
    - content: "Lower latency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Embedding data to reduce the number of requests can improve performance, but it also affects cost."
    - content: "Reduce latency and cost"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Embedding data to reduce the number of requests can improve performance and lower cost."
