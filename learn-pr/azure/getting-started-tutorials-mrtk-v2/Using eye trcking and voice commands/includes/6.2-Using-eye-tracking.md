# Using eye-tracking

## Eye-Tracking

MRTK is highly considerate about the way humans communicate and express themselves. HoloLens 2 offers an exciting and powerful new input: Eye-tracking! Eye-tracking enables you to quickly and effortlessly engage with holograms across their view and make your system smarter by better identifying your intention. There are many use cases of Eye-tracking like user intent, implicit actions, attention tracking, gaming, text entry, and so on.

## Eye tracking requirements checklist

For eye tracking to work correctly, the following requirements must be met. If you are new to eye tracking on HoloLens 2 and to how eye tracking is set up in MRTK, don't worry! We will go into detail on how to address each of them further below.

1. An 'Eye Gaze Data Provider' must be added to the input system. This provides eye tracking data from the platform.
2. The 'GazeInput' capability must be enabled in the application manifest. **This capability can be set in Unity 2019, but in Unity 2018 and earlier this capability is only available in Visual Studio and through the MRTK build tool**
3. The HoloLens must be eye calibrated for the current user. Check out our [sample for detecting whether a user is eye calibrated or not](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/features/input/eye-tracking/eye-tracking-is-user-calibrated?view=mrtkunity-2021-05).
