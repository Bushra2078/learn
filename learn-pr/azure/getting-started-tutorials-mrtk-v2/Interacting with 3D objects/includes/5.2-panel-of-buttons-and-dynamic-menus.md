# Including Panel of Buttons and Dynamic Menu

## UI Buttons 

Buttons help the user to trigger an immediate action. It's one of the foundational components provided by MRTK. Various kinds of button prefabs can be used depending on your situation. The Button is primarily based totally on the Interactable idea to offer smooth UI controls for buttons or different interactive surfaces. The Interactable module is an all-in-one box to make any item interactable and conscious. Interactable acts as a catch-considering all forms of entering consisting of touch, hand rays, speech, and so on, and funnel those interactions into activities and visible subject responses.

## UI Menu

Menu is a UX control, which offers a set of buttons or different UI components. It's floating across the user's frame and effortlessly available anytime. Since it's loosely coupled with the person, it does now no longer disturb the user's interplay with the target content. The user can use the 'Pin' button to world-lock/unlock the menu. The menu may be grabbed and located at a selected position.
