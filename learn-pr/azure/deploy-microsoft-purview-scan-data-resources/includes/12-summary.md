# Summary

You were requested by Fabrikam to help establish the foundation for effective data usage and unified data governance. You created a Microsoft Purview proof of concept by creating a Microsoft Purview account, creating collections, assigning permissions, and registering and scanning your first data source.

Using Microsoft Purview as a central catalog, Frabrikam can now begin to discover a complete and comprehensive overview of their data estate by reviewing the scanned assets in Microsoft Purview and registering more data sources.
