## Scenario

The Fabricam Corp shoe company has expanded rapidly over the last year, going from a handful of employees and a single data lake, to a multi-regional business with data across several platforms. In the expansion, keeping track of what data Fabricam stores and where has mostly fallen to department heads. Data officers often have to repeat security procedures as new data repositories surface, data experts and officers are flooded with requests for data access and questions about their data. Before the company can go international, Fabricam needs a solution to help them understand and take command of their full data estate.

Microsoft Purview will allow Fabricam to register all their data sources, manage access and data discovery by department, and even understand where data comes from and what kind of data it is.

You've been requested to create a Microsoft Purview proof of concept for Fabricam, to understand how to deploy Microsoft Purview in an environment and onboard resources.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll have deployed a Microsoft Purview account in your Azure environment, registered an Azure Data Lake Gen 2 Storage Account, and scanned the storage account so Microsoft Purview can classify the data, and add the metadata to its data map.

## Prerequisites

In order to proceed with the hands-on components of this module, you will require the following:

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with an active subscription.
- Owner permissions within a Resource Group to create resources and manage role assignments.

## Prepare environment

To provide data for Microsoft Purview to classify, we'll set up an ADLS Gen 2 account with some sample data. Follow the steps below to create the resource.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.

1. Select **Create a resource**.
1. Search for and select **Storage account**.
1. Select the **Storage account** plan, and select **Create**.
1. Select an existing resource group, or create a new one.
1. Create a unique storage account name.
1. Select **Standard** performance.
1. Select **Locally-redundant storage**.NET
1. Select **Next: Advanced**.
1. Select **Enable hierarchical namespace**.
1. Select **Review + create**.
1. Download and install [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/).
1. Open Azure Storage Explorer.
