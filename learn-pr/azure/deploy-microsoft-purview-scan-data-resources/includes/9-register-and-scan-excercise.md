# Grant the Microsoft Purview managed identity access

To scan a source, Microsoft Purview requires a set of **credentials**. For Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Microsoft Purview supports the following [authentication methods](/azure/purview/register-scan-adls-gen2#setting-up-authentication-for-a-scan).

* Managed Identity (recommended)
* Service Principal
* Account Key

In this module we'll walk through how to grant the Microsoft Purview managed identity the necessary access to successfully configure and run a scan.

1. Navigate to your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account and select **Access Control (IAM)** from the left navigation menu.
