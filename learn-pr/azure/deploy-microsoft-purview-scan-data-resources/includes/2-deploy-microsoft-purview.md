# Deploy a Microsoft Purview account

You've been requested by Fabrikam to build an automatically curated and up-to-date view of their holistic data estate. You have decided to use  Microsoft Purview, as it will allow Fabrikam to register, scan, and ingest metadata from a variety of data sources into a central data map. The first step is to deploy a Microsoft Purview account. In this unit, we will cover configuration settings, account concepts, and key considerations.

## Microsoft Purview account name

The Microsoft Purview account name is used to programmatically access the Microsoft Purview account and can't be changed. The name of your Microsoft Purview account must follow these rules:

* Globally unique - no other account can have this name
* Can contain only letters, numbers and hyphens
* The first and last characters must be a letter or number
* Spaces aren't allowed

## Managed resources

Microsoft Purview creates a storage account and an Azure Event Hubs account as managed resources within the subscription that the Microsoft Purview account is provisioned in. These resources are required to support enhanced security features during scanning.

* The name of the managed resource group will be auto-generated but can be changed during the Microsoft Purview account creation process.
* The names of the storage account and Azure Event Hubs namespace will be auto-generated during account creation and can't be changed.

## Microsoft Purview Data Map

The Microsoft Purview Data Map is central to the Microsoft Purview service as it is responsible for storing and serving metadata, lineage, classifications, and other annotations associated with data assets. The size of the Data Map is measured in Capacity Units, which are compute and storage units. There's no need to predetermine the number of Capacity Units required as Microsoft Purview will **auto-scale** up and down based on usage.

## Capacity Units

All Microsoft Purview accounts come with one Capacity Unit by default, and elastically grow based on usage. The Data Map is **always on** while the Microsoft Purview account exists, in which case, there will always be a minimum of 1 Capacity Unit consumed.

Each Capacity Unit:

* Can support up to **25 data map operations per second**.
* Includes storage of up to **10 GB** of metadata about data assets.

## Scanning

The compute required to facilitate the automated population of the Data Map is serverless (**pay as you go**), run on logical compute units called vCores, and based on the duration of scans or ingestion jobs. Duration of these jobs can vary based on the number of systems scanned, data assets (files or tables, for example) in the scanned systems, number of data classifications you want to identify, the shape of the data, and performance of the system scanned. Scanning is billed based on the number of vCore Hours consumed.

## Network connectivity

You can connect to your Microsoft Purview account either publicly, via public IP addresses or service endpoints, or privately, using a private endpoint. In this module, our proof of concept will use a publically available Microsoft Purview account. But you can also [learn more about private endpoints for your Microsoft Purview account](/azure/purview/catalog-private-link).
