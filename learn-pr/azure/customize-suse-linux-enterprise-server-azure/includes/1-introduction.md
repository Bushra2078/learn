SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) is an adaptable and easy-to-manage platform that allows developers and administrators to deploy business-critical workloads on-premises, in the cloud and at the edge. It is optimized for performance, security and reliability. Since 2009, SUSE and Microsoft have been working together to provide unique, co-developed, Azure-optimized solutions for SUSE SLES.
