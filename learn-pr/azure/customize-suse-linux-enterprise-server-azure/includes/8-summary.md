In the scenario for this module, the startup retailer you work for wanted to create a new website with a LAMP stack.  

Through the units in the module, we discussed how to create a SUSE SLES VM on Azure through the Azure Portal, add Apache webserver using YaST, and add MariaDB with zypper. We also practiced uninstalling packages for future reference.  

The purpose of the of the module was to communicate the role RPM packages play in customizing your virtual machine in the cloud and to introduce you to SUSE tools that make installing packages and managing package updates easier and more automated.  

Once you become familiar with YaST and zypper, you can use them to customize and refine other SUSE deployments on Azure such as:  

- **SLES for SAP Applications** which includes specialized, built-in features to reduce downtime, enhance security, optimize performance, and reduce the maintenance workload of sys admins.
- **SLES for High Performance Computing (HPC)** which includes infrastructure and tools to support parallel compute in the cloud.
- **Others available on Azure Marketplace**: SUMa, SQL on SLES, SAP Solution Templates
