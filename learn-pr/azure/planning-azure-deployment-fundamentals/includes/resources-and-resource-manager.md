## Azure Resource Groups

Resource groups are a fundamental element of the Azure platform. A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure. These resources are anything you create in an Azure subscription like virtual machines, Application Gateways, and CosmosDB instances. All resources must be in a resource group and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group. Many resources can be moved between resource groups with some services having specific limitations or requirements to move. Resource groups can't be nested. Before any resource can be provisioned, you need a resource group for it to be placed in.

### Logical grouping

Resource groups exist to help manage and organize your Azure resources. By placing resources of similar usage, type, or location, you can provide some order and organization to resources you create in Azure. Logical grouping is the aspect that you're most interested in here, since there's a lot of disorder among our resources.

### Life cycle

If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within are also deleted. Organizing resources by life cycle can be useful in non-production environments, where you might try an experiment, but then dispose of it when done. Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources at once.

### Authorization

Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. By applying RBAC permissions to a resource group, you can ease administration and limit access to allow only what is needed.

## Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and organize your resources after deployment.

When a user sends a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives the request. It authenticates and authorizes the request. Resource Manager sends the request to the Azure service, which takes the requested action. Because all requests are handled through the same API, you see consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools.

The following image shows the role Azure Resource Manager plays in handling Azure requests.

All capabilities that are available in the portal are also available through PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST APIs, and client SDKs. Functionality initially released through APIs will be represented in the portal within 180 days of initial release.

### The benefits of using Resource Manager

With Resource Manager, you can:

- Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.

- Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.

- Redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.

- Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.

- Apply access control to all services because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.

- Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.

- Clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.

### Understand scope

Azure provides four levels of scope: management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources. The following image shows an example of these layers.

### Management levels

You apply management settings at any of these levels of scope. The level you select determines how widely the setting is applied. Lower levels inherit settings from higher levels. For example, when you apply a policy to the subscription, the policy is applied to all resource groups and resources in your subscription. When you apply a policy on the resource group, that policy is applied the resource group and all its resources. However, another resource group doesn't have that policy assignment.

You can deploy templates to tenants, management groups, subscriptions, or resource groups.
