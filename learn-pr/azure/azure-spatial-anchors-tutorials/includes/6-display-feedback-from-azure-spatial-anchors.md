Azure Spatial Anchors gives developers the tools they need to create mixed reality apps that are spatially aware. Users can give feedback on anchor discovery, events, and status. It's a tool for storing and retrieving spatial-point cloud data. You can see the action based on the users' feedback through a UI panel, which displays essential information about the current Spatial Anchors session.

## Scene visibility

You can rapidly hide and expose GameObjects in the scene view by using Unity's scene visibility controls without affecting their in-game visibility. This ability is important when you're working with large or complex scenes where viewing and selecting specific GameObjects can be difficult. 

Because visibility options affect only the scene view, using them is safer than deactivating GameObjects. This means you won't be able to mistakenly delete GameObjects from the rendered scene or start superfluous bake processes for lighting, occlusion, or other systems.
