In this module, you learned the fundamentals of Azure Spatial Anchors. You explored the steps to start and stop an Azure Spatial Anchors session. You also created, uploaded, and downloaded spatial anchors on a single device.

Later, you persisted spatial anchors between app sessions and app restarts by saving the anchor ID to the local disk on HoloLens. You also shared spatial anchors between multiple devices for a basic multiple-user, static hologram shared experience. You created a UI panel that displays the status of the spatial anchors and provides an opportunity for users to provide real-time feedback.

Finally, you built your project to Android and iOS devices by using AR Foundation, ARCore XR Plugin, and ARKit XR Plugin.

## Next steps

You can continue to customize this application and add more spatial anchors. Consider trying the following interactions:

* Add a global spatial anchor.
* Integrate spatial anchors in any of the previously built applications.
