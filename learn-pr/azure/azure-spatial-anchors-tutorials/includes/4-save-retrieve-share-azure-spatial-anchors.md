Azure Spatial Anchors lets you share anchors in the world across many devices. It works with various development environments. You can share the anchor ID among multiple devices by saving it to the local disk on HoloLens. You can also achieve spatial alignment across multiple app sessions.

## Spatial placements

Spatial mapping provides applications with the opportunity to present natural and familiar forms of interaction to the user. What could be more natural than placing down your phone on the desk?

Constraining the placement of holograms (or more generally, any selection of spatial locations) to lie on surfaces provides a natural mapping from 3D (point in space) to 2D (point on surface). This mapping reduces the amount of information that the user needs to provide to the application. It makes the user's interactions faster, easier, and more precise.
