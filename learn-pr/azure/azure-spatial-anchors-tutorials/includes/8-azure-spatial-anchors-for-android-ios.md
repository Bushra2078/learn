Unity's AR Foundation is a high-level, cross-platform API that supports augmented reality. By using AR Foundation, you can you write your app once and deploy it to both Android and iOS devices. 

It used to be difficult and expensive to create an augmented-reality smartphone app. Now, users need only their mobile devices to access augmented-reality apps. We have the tools to create apps faster and at a lower cost. 

This unit teaches you to build spatial anchors for Android devices by using ARCore XR Plugin and for iOS devices by using ARkit XR Plugin.

## ARCore XR Plugin

You can create augmented-reality apps for Android smartphones by using ARCore XR Plugin. Along with ARCore Extensions for the AR Foundation SDK, a default version of this plug-in is installed. ARCore XR Plugin adds support for ARCore to Unity's multiple-platform XR API. This supports efficient background rendering, anchors, occlusion, and more.

## ARKit XR Plugin

ARKit is a high-level augmented-reality development platform. It helps developers create augmented-reality apps and experiences by using the CPU power of iOS devices and their cameras.

To make creating an augmented-reality experience easier, ARKit integrates device-motion tracking, camera-scene capture, powerful image processing, and display conveniences. By using these technologies and an iOS device's front or rear camera, you can create a variety of augmented-reality experiences.

## Windows Mixed Reality camera settings

The Windows Mixed Reality camera settings provider detects the device on which the app is running and applies the relevant configuration settings based on the display (transparent or opaque). This configures and optimizes the application's camera for usage in mixed-reality apps by using the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK).

## New data provider

The MRTK input system is a modular framework that allows input device support to be added as needed. A unique input data provider might be required to enable compatibility for a new hardware platform. 

Data sources are available as add-ons from third parties, or as part of the MRTK. The approval process for new data providers submitting to the MRTK varies by situation, and is disclosed at the time of the initial proposal.

## Unity AR camera settings

The Unity AR camera settings provider is a beta MRTK component that you can use to run mixed-reality apps on Android and iOS devices.

The Unity AR camera settings provider offers a variety of tracking configuration options. These options are exclusive to Unity's version of the Unity AR camera settings provider.

## Strip Engine Code

Strip Engine Code is enabled by default in Unity's player settings, as is native code stripping. Remove unnecessary modules and classes from the native Unity engine code by enabling Strip Engine Code. To keep all of the modules in the native Unity engine code, disable Strip Engine Code.
