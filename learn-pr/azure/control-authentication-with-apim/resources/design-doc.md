# Module Design

## Title

Control authentication for your APIs with Azure API Management

## Role(s)

- Solution architect
- Developer

## Level

- Intermediate

## Product(s)

- Azure API Management

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of certificates
- Basic understanding of API Management

## Summary

Discover how to protect your APIs from unauthorized use through the use of API keys and client certificate authentication.

## Learning objectives

- Use API keys to secure your APIs
- Use client certificate authentication to secure your APIs

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Control authentication for your APIs with Azure API Management*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- |---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    A meteorological company has an API that customers use to access weather data for forecasts and research. There is proprietary information in this data, and they would like to secure this to ensure that only paying customers have access to these capabilities. They would like to use Azure API Management to properly secure this API from unauthorized use.

2. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

3. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

4. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    2. Step
    3. Step

5. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

## Notes

Subscriptions & keys in APIM - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-create-subscriptions

Client cert auth in APIM - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates-for-clients

For the exercise, we'll need to use the consumption tier to minimize APIM spin-up time. This is only available in a few regions and is in preview, so we'll need to give accurate steps to ensure the proper tier is used.
