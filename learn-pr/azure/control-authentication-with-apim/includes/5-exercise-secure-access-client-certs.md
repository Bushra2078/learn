The Weather company has decided to secure its API through certificate authentication for certain clients, they already have certificate authentication with clients within other systems. This will allow clients to use existing certificates to authenticate themselves against the API Management gateway

[!include[](../../../includes/azure-sandbox-activate.md)]

In this unit you will:
- Create a Self Signed Certificate
- Upload the Client Certificate to the API Management gateway
- Edit the inbound policy to only allow clients with the specified certificate in their request
- Call the API Management gateway passing in the certificate

## Create Self-Signed Certificate

Firstly, you will use the Cloud Shell to create a Self Signed Certificate, this will be used for the authentication between the client and the API Management gateway

```PowerShell
$pwd = '<enter-a-password>'
$ApiGatewayName = '<name-of-your-gateway>'
$pfxFilePath = 'selfsigncert.pfx'
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out selfsigncert.crt -subj /CN=localhost
openssl pkcs12 -export -out $pfxFilePath -inkey privateKey.key -in selfsigncert.crt -password pass:$pwd
```

## Export certificate as Bytes

Next, we will export the certificate as a ```Byte[]```, this is to prepare for the upload into the API Management gateway. Run the following commands in the Cloud Shell

```PowerShell

$flag = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509KeyStorageFlags]::Exportable
$collection = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2Collection 
$collection.Import($pfxFilePath, $pwd, $flag)
$pkcs12ContentType = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509ContentType]::Pkcs12
$clearBytes = $collection.Export($pkcs12ContentType, $pwd)
```

## Add Certificate to the gateway

You will now upload the self signed certificate into the gateway. Run the following commands in the cloud shell

```PowerShell
$ApiMgmtContext = New-AzApiManagementContext  -ResourceGroupName "<resource-group>"  -ServiceName $ApiGatewayName
New-AzApiManagementCertificate -Context $ApiMgmtContext -PfxBytes $clearBytes -PfxPassword $pwd
```

## Edit inbound policy to only allow requests with a valid certificate

Now you will need to create the authentication policy within the API Management gateway.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you activated the sandbox with.
1. In the left menu, click **All Resources**, and then select your API gateway.
1. Under **API management**, click **Client Certificates**
1. You will see a single certificate, highlight and copy the thumbprint for the next steps

5. Click **APIs**.
6. Select **Weather Data**
7. Click the **Inbound processing** policies button

![Screenshot showing inbound processing policy button](../media/5-inbound-policy.png)

8. Add the following policy expression into the inbound node of the policy file, replacing the ```desired-thumbprint``` with the thumbprint you copied in step 4

```XML
<inbound>
    <choose>
        <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint != "desired-thumbprint")" >
            <return-response>
                <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
            </return-response>
        </when>
    </choose>
    <base />
</inbound>
```

9. Click **Save**

## Call the gateway passing in a client certificate

Finally, you can test the new authentication policy. You can test with the certificate and without. Firstly, you will convert the pfx certificate to pem format for use with cURL. Run the following command within the Azure Cloud Shell

```PowerShell
openssl pkcs12 -in selfsigncert.pfx -out selfsigncert.pem â€“nodes
```

1. **Call the API using the certificate and key**

Within the Azure Cloud Shell copy and paste the following cURL command, using the subscription key from the first exercise.

```PowerShell
curl -X GET `
  https://[gateway-name].azure-api.net/api/Weather/53/-1 `
   -H 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: [subscription-key]' `
  --cert-type pem `
  --cert selfsigncert.pem
```

This should result in a successful response similar to below

```JSON
{"mainOutlook":{"temperature":32,"humidity":34},"wind":{"speed":11,"direction":239.0},"date":"2019-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","latitude":53.0,"longitude":-1.0}
```

2. **Remove the certificate to test unauthorised access**

Run the following command within the Cloud Shell

```PowerShell
curl -X GET `
  https://[api-gateway-name].azure-api.net/api/Weather/53/-1
  -H 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: [Subscription Key]'
```

This should return a 403 Client certificate error, no data will be returned.
