Many organizations today work with *big data*. The huge volume and variety of data and the speed of data generation necessitates having systems that help you manage and control it. In the past, organizations used relational database-management systems to control data. However, organizations now want the functionality of open-source software combined with the benefits of hosted platforms. Azure HDInsight on AKS is the perfect example of this partnership. HDInsight on AKS allows you to deploy popular Open-Source Analytics workloads like Apache Spark™, Apache Flink®️, and Trino without the overhead of managing and monitoring containers.

You can build end-to-end, petabyte-scale Big Data applications spanning streaming through Apache Flink, data engineering and machine learning using Apache Spark, and Trino's powerful query engine.

All these capabilities combined with HDInsight on AKS’s strong developer focus enables enterprises and digital natives with deep technical expertise to build and operate applications that are right fit for their needs. HDInsight on AKS allows developers to access all the rich configurations provided by open-source software and the extensibility to seamlessly include other ecosystem offerings. This offering empowers developers to test and tune their applications to extract the best performance at optimal cost.

HDInsight on AKS integrates with the entire Azure ecosystem, shortening implementation cycles and improving time to realize value.

## Example scenario

Let's imagine you work for an organization that builds workloads that ingest data for historical reporting and advanced analytics. Perhaps you also have streaming data that requires analysis. In this situation, you might want to consider using HDInsight. It enables ingestion of all data into a single Data Lake location. You can then use it to manage the following workloads:

- Batch processing
- Data warehousing
- Data-science operations
- Streaming

## What will we be doing?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to evaluate whether HDInsight can help your organization process big data. You'll also be able to describe how HDInsight uses popular open-source frameworks that support many data scenarios.

## What is the main goal?

The main goal is to determine whether HDInsight on AKS is a suitable choice for your big-data processing requirements.
