Many organizations today work with *big data*. The huge volume and variety of data and the speed of data generation necessitates having systems that help you manage and control it. In the past, organizations used relational database-management systems to control data. However, organizations now want the functionality of open-source software combined with the benefits of hosted platforms. Azure HDInsight on AKS is the perfect example of this partnership. HDInsight on AKS allows you to deploy popular Open-Source Analytics workloads like Apache Spark™, Apache Flink®️, and Trino without the overhead of managing and monitoring containers.

You can build end-to-end, petabyte-scale Big Data applications spanning streaming through Apache Flink, data engineering and machine learning using Apache Spark, and Trino's powerful query engine.
