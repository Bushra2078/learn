Your first task is to plan your company's migration to Azure. You have a set amount of time to put this plan together before presenting it to the IT Director and other leaders around the business.

In this unit, you'll cover some of the considerations and methods you can use to form a plan for your migration to Azure. Every situation is different but, by following some principles, you can achieve your goals in the best possible way, in the shortest amount of time.

## Planning your migration to Azure

You can help increase the chances of a successful migration by accurately assessing and planning the scope of work before you begin any migration activity. Implementing the plan will reduce the likelihood of issues arising further down the line.

### Migration Scope and Planning

Before you do anything, you should decide which servers, applications, and services are in the scope for migration. You may tie the migration work in to a data center consolidation project, and try to use the exercise to remove outdated hardware from your environment. Once you know what the goal is, you can start involving people across the business who will be affected, and have an interest in the work.

Azure Migrate can help you identify and assess your current environment, and help you focus the scope of your migration to the machines that are most suitable.

### Involving key stakeholders

In any modern business, the IT estate/services will be consumed by everyone in some way or another,  a prime example being line-of-business applications. These applications could be used by specific sections of the business and include application owners - or superusers - who have a wealth of experience to call on. Involving these people in the migration planning stage will really help, as they can offer guidance in areas where the knowledge of the person running the project may have gaps. Often each area of the business will appoint business owners to manage specific sections. In addition to application owners, these business owners should be involved in the process because they can individually offer insight in to how a migration would affect their particular area and users.

### Costs and savings

Part of the business's plan to migrate to Azure could be to reduce costs, as moving to the cloud offers cost savings over running your own on-premise estate. Once the initial scoping exercise has been completed, use the Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator to understand the real work costs to support the project and the company's longer term financial goals.

Azure Migrate can also give you an idea of the costs running your migrated environment on Azure.

### Discovery and evaluation

Now you can produce a full inventory and dependency map to determine how in scope servers and services communicate. A modern business could have hundreds of applications spread across the estate. Each application needs to be fully investigated before any work takes place. Avoiding downtime for those applications can be difficult, so a firm plan needs to be in place.

Tools such as Azure Migrate help in this scenario, once run, it can produce useful information about the underlying servers and their personal profile information. You can garner information, such as compute usage and performance metrics, which you then use to feed in to your overall plan.

Once you have a full picture of the environment in scope for migration, an evaluation can be formed about best way to approach each stage. Run through the migration process end to end with a simple server or application first is a good plan. Completing a migration on a small scale will give you an idea of possible issues. You now have the chance to resolve them before moving on to more complex servers and applications.
