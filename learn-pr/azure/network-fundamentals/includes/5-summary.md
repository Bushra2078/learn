When considering the move to the cloud, it's essential in your role as either an Azure Developer, Solution Architect, or Administrator to know the fundamentals of how your network works. 

While networks are made up of various tangible elements like network devices, switches, and network routers. There are other aspects, like network communication protocols and network security, which will protect our organization's assets and resources. Understanding the underlying network protocols and standards and how networks communicate is an essential step in understanding Azure concepts.

In this module, we explored the principals of networks, getting an understanding of the essential components, and building blocks for all networks.  We explored the reasons why network protocols and standards are needed and saw how they shape and allow interoperability of both hardware and software when we build  and maintain networks. We now know the difference between a LAN and a WAN, and the different Ethernet types.  Lastly, we explored TCP/IP, subnets, DNS, and some of the core communication protocols like IPv4 and IPv6.

Without these core network principals, we wouldn't have the internet as we know it today.
