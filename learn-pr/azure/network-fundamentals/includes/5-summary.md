When considering the move to the cloud, it's essential in your role as either an Azure Developer, Solution Architect, or Administrator to know the fundamentals of how your network works. 

While networks are made up of various tangible elements like network devices, switches, and network routers. There are other aspects, like network communication protocols and network security, which will protect your organization's assets and resources. Understanding the underlying network protocols and standards and how networks communicate is an essential step in understanding Azure concepts.

In this module, you explored the principals of networks, getting an understanding of the essential components, and building blocks for all networks.  You understand why network protocols and standards are needed.  How they have shaped and allowed interoperability of both hardware and software when it comes to building and maintaining networks. You now know the distinction between a LAN and a WAN, and the different Ethernet types.  Lastly, you explored TCP/IP, subnets, DNS, and some of the core communication protocols like IPv4 and IPv6.

Without these core network principals, we wouldn't have the internet as we know it now, nor any type of networking in your organization.
