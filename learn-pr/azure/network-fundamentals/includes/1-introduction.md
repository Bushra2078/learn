Moving to the cloud and taking on a role as an Azure Developer, Solution Architect, or Administrator requires knowing the foundations for how networking works, and how to use different devices to build networks. While networks are made up of various network devices, there are other aspects to keep in mind as well. For example, network communication protocols require devices to have network addresses assigned, and we'll need to secure our network to protect our organization's assets and resources. 

In this module, we'll explore how networks communicate with each other. We'll discuss network protocols and standards, and the difference between a WAN and a LAN. Finally, we'll get to know more about the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocols (TCP/IP), IP addresses, and ports.

While the content of this module applies to any network, we'll see where and how the concepts apply to networks managed using Azure.

- Describe the differences between WAN, PAN, and LAN
- List the different network protocols and network standards
- Describe network communication concepts like the TCP/IP model, DNS, and ports
