Moving to the cloud and taking on a role as an Azure Developer, Solution Architect, or Administrator requires knowing the foundations for how networking works, and how to use different devices to build networks. Networks are made up of various tangible elements like network devices, switches, and routers. There are other aspects, like network communication protocols and network security, that protect your organization's assets and resources. Understanding the underlying network protocols and standards, and how networks communicate, helps you understand Azure networking concepts.

In the first of three network fundamentals modules, you'll look at how networks communicate with each other.  You'll explore network protocols and standards, and understand the difference between a WAN and a LAN. Finally, you'll get to know about TCP/IP, the Domain Name Service, and ports.

While the content of this module applies to any network, you'll see how these fundamentals are used on Azure.
