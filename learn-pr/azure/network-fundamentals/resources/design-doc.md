## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of Networking Fundamentals
1.	Introduction
Moving to the cloud and taking on a role as an Azure Developer or Administrator requires knowing the foundations for how networking works, and how to use different devices to build networks. Networks are made up of various devices—computers, switches, routers—connected together by cables or wireless signals. Understanding the basics of how networks are put together is an important step in understanding Azure concepts. 

2.	Standards and Protocols
- Network protocols are formal standards and policies comprised of rules, procedures and formats that define communication between two or more devices over a network. Network protocols govern the end-to-end processes of timely, secure and managed data or network communication.
    - Network communication protocols: Basic data communication protocols, such as TCP/IP and HTTP. 
    - Network security protocols: Implement security over network communications and include HTTPS, SSL and SFTP. 
    - Network management protocols: Provide network governance and maintenance and include SNMP and ICMP.
    - Example as to how this relates to what will be done in Azure.

3.	Basic Clients and Servers
- A server is a computer that holds content and services such as a website, a media file, or a chat application.
- A client is a different computer, such as your laptop or cell phone, that requests to view, download, or use the content. The client can connect over a network to exchange information.
- Example as to how this relates to what will be done in Azure.
- Knowledge check

4.	LANs and WANs
- What they are and how different
- Explain ethernet, MAC addresses, ARP
- Example as to how this relates to what will be done in Azure.
- Knowledge check

5.	IP/TCP Basics
- In order to send and direct data across a network, computers need to be able to identify destinations and origins. This identification is an IP—Internet Protocol—address. An IP address is just a set of four numbers between 1 and 254, separated by dots.
- Include subnetting 
- Private IP addressing
- DNS
- Ports
- Example as to how this relates to what will be done in Azure.
- Knowledge check

6.	Network Hub and Switches
- Hub: A network device that repeats the traffic it receives to all connected devices.
- Switch: A network device that sends traffic it receives to a specific connected device, such as a single desktop computer or laptop.
- Example as to how this relates to what will be done in Azure.
- Knowledge check

7.	Authentication, Authorization, and Monitoring
- Overview of the purpose of network authentication and authorization and why it is important.  
- Introduction to network monitoring and most common practices. 
- Example as to how this relates to what will be done in Azure.
- Knowledge check

8.	Routers, Firewalls and Security
- Router: A network device that can bridge between different networks, determine what traffic can pass between them, and perform other functions on a network, such as assigning IP addresses.
- High level summary of important security concepts
    - VPN, security zones, firewalls
- Example as to how this relates to what will be done in Azure.
