  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:

  - content: "What are network standards used for?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ensure that hardware conforms to a minimum standard necessary for a good network development. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Network standards are designed to ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors work seamlessly together."
    - content: "To ensure that software is tightly constrained and meets the needs of the organizations network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Network standards are designed to ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors work seamlessly together."
    - content: "To ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors can work together seamlessly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Network standards are designed to ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors work seamlessly together."

  - content: "What is the primary purpose of a hub?"
    choices:
    - content: "To allow one ethernet network device to send data packets to a specific ethernet device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hubs connect ethernet network devices together, packets are sent to all devices connected to the hub."
    - content: "It allows the connection of multiple ethernet devices making them act as a single network segment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Hubs offer the simplest form of network, allowing multiple ethernet-based network enabled devices to communicate with each other."
    - content: "To allow multiple ethernet network devices access to the internet. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hubs offer the simplest form of network, allowing multiple ethernet-based network enabled devices to communicate with each other."

  - content: "What is the principle difference between hub routing and switch routing"
    choices:
    - content: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices, whereas switch routing sends packets to specific devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices, whereas switch routing sends packets to specific devices."
    - content: "Hub routing sends packet to specific locations, whereas switch routing is only used to route traffic between switches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices, whereas switch routing sends packets to specific devices."
    - content: "Hub routing sends all packet to all connected devices, whereas switch routing is only used to route traffic between switches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices, whereas switch routing sends packets to specific devices."

  - content: "What does a router do?"
    choices:
    - content: "A router is a network device that works out the fastest and most efficient way of sending data across the network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A router is designed to connect different networks together."
    - content: "A router is a network device that forwards data packets around faults in your network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A router is used to link different networks together.  These can be on-premises or in the cloud via the internet."
    - content: "A router is a network device that forwards data packets between computer networks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A router is an essential part of your network.  A router, as well as connecting different networks, also connects to the internet."
