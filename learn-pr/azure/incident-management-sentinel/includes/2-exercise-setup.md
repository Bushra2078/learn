    You're prompted to sign in to Azure.

## Task 2: Check created resources

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Resource groups**.
2. Select **azure-sentinel-rg**.
3. Sort the list of resources by **Type**.
4. The resource group should contain the resources displayed in this table.

    | Name  | Type  | Description |

## Task 3: Configure Azure Sentinel connectors

In this task, you'll deploy Azure Sentinel connectors to Azure Activity.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select Azure Sentinel, and then select the previously created Azure Sentinel workspace.
2. In the **Azure Sentinel** page, on the menu bar, in the **Configuration** section, select **Data connectors**.
3. On the **Data connectors** pane, search for and select **Azure Activity**. On the **details** pane, select **Open connector page**.
4. On the **Azure Activity** pane, select the link **Configure Azure Activity logs**.
5. Select your subscription and then select **Connect**.
6. When you receive a status of **Connected**, you can return to **Azure Sentinel | Data connectors**.
7. On the **Azure Sentinel** | **Data connectors** pane, ensure that the **Azure Activity** connector has a status of **Connected**.

> [!NOTE]
> The connector for Azure Activity might take 15-30 minutes until it displays a status of **Connected**.
