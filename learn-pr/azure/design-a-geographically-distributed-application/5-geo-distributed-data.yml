  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "In the shipment tracking application, you want to automatically fail over write access to the SQL database, when there is a regional outage. You don't want to write custom code. What should you do?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Use active geo-replication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If you use active geo-replication, the secondary region remains read-only, until you manually initiate the failover. You can automate the failover by writing code that calls the REST API."
    - content: "Use an auto-failover group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By using an auto-failover group, you can configure the primary database to fail over onto the replica in the secondary region automatically."
    - content: "Use multiple write regions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure SQL Database does not support multiple write regions. That's a Cosmos DB feature."
  - content: "You want to ensure that no completed transactions are lost in a regional outage. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Cosmos DB with a single write region."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Cosmos DB using synchronous replication, in which a transaction is only complete when it has replicated to a quorum of replicas."
    - content: "Use Azure SQL Database with active geo-replication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Active geo-replication uses asynchronous replication, in which a transaction replicates after it is complete on the writeable replica. If a failure occurs before replication occurs, the change may be lost."
    - content: "Use Azure SQL Database with an auto-failover group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Auto-failover groups use asynchronous replication, in which a transaction replicates after it is complete on the writeable replica. If a failure occurs before replication occurs, the change may be lost."
