## Learning objectives

1. Design networking architecture for a geographically distributed application
2. Design the application architecture for a geographically distributed application
3. Design the data architecture for a geographically distributed application

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Design a geographically distributed application*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    A shipping company is building a new portal on Azure for customers to create, manage, and track shipments. This portal is a critical part of their business, and needs to be highly available and tolerant of faults across geographic regions. They need an architecture that will provide these capabilities and identify the services to provide the features they need.

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

## Notes

We'll have a decent amount of theory in this module, but should also provide details around what services to use to provide geographic diversity for network, application, and data.
