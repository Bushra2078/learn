Even small organizations can operate globally when they host their apps on Azure. To serve users around the globe, you must design an app architecture that responds rapidly to users, whatever their location.

Suppose you work for a shipping company is building a new portal on Azure for customers to create, manage, and track shipments. This portal is a critical part of their business, and needs to be highly available and tolerant of faults across geographic regions. The company wants an architecture that will provide these capabilities and identify the services for the features they need.

In this module, you'll learn how to design an application architecture for high availability and fault tolerance that's present in more than one region.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to design this kind of application architecture and understand the benefits, and limitations of its component parts.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Design networking architecture for a geographically distributed application.
- Design the application architecture for a geographically distributed application.
- Design the data architecture for a geographically distributed application.

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate familiarity with Azure PaaS services.
- Intermediate familiarity with architecture principles.
