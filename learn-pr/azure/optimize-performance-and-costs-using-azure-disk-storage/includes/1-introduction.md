Most organizations have diverse requirements for their cloud-hosted data. Data often is of different types and sizes, and no single storage solution meets all requirements. Suppose you work for a medium-size financial services company. Your Chief Technology Officer (CTO) wants to migrate several applications, databases, and support files to the cloud. This will reduce the number of physical servers that your company maintains in their datacenter. As part of your migration strategy, you must determine a suitable approach for your cloud-based storage infrastructure.

A primary concern in a migration strategy is how to move enterprise applications that require high-performance storage, such as SAP HANA and many SQL databases. Some application workloads run periodic batch jobs. These demand higher performance for short periods, but otherwise experience baseline performance most of the time.

Youâ€™ve must evaluate Azure Disk Storage types and capabilities and propose a storage solution that optimizes performance and costs for applications that require high storage.
