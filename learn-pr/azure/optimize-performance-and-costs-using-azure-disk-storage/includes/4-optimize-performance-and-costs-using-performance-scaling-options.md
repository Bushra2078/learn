By migrating your organization's critical workload to Azure, you can provide a range of infrastructure requirements such as scalable performance, built-in security, durability, and cost optimization.

Many of these infrastructure requirements are directly associated with block storage, which is the foundation of Azure Disk Storage.

The type and size of the disk that you select for your critical applications directly impacts the performance and can generate higher costs if you don't select the appropriate option.

To enable you to optimize performance and costs, Azure Disk Storage also offers capabilities that allow you to scale your performance cost-effectively to meet your workloads needs and keep costs under control.

## Performance tiers for Azure Disk Storage

You can adjust and balance the IOPS, throughput, and latency of your Azure disks by selecting the right performance tier for your needs. To select the right combination, you should be aware of your application requirements. High-I/O applications, such as database servers or online transactional processing systems, will require higher IOPS, while more computational-based applications might work well with much lower requirements.

You might have events â€“ like a seasonal promotion or performance testing - where the application requires, on a temporary basis, higher demands on performance. You can change the performance tier on Premium SSDs without increasing the size of the disks when you need to meet a higher performance demand, allowing you to optimize costs. For example, your marketing applications are provisioned to use a Premium SSD disk with a P4 performance tier that's limited to 120 IOPS and 25 MBps. Because of a seasonal sale, the interest for your marketing application has increased dramatically and you want to meet the higher capacity demands on a temporary basis. You can increase the performance tier of your P4 disk to a higher tier, such as P30 with 5,000 IOPS and 200 MBps throughput. When your marketing campaign is over, you can change the disk tier back to the original P4 tier. During the period when you use a higher performance tier, you'll be charged for the price of that tier. In this example, you'll be charged the price of P30.

Azure currently supports the ability to dynamically change your performance for Ultra Disks without dismounting it from the VM. On Premium SSDs, Azure offers this functionality in preview to a limited number of regions.

## Change the performance tier on premium disks while in use by the VMs

You can change the performance tier of a Premium SSD without downtime and without dismounting it from the VM.

At the time of writing of this content, Azure supports this functionality only in East US2 region and requires that you deploy the VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template with the 2020-12-01 API.

You can change the performance tier of the disk by using the Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) or the Azure portal.
Use the following commands to change the disk performance tier:

Azure CLI

```bash
subscriptionId="yourSubscriptionID"
resourceGroupName="yourResourceGroupName"
diskName="yourDiskName"
diskSize="yourDiskSize"
performanceTier="yourDesiredPerformanceTier"
region=EastUS2EUAP

az login
az account set --subscription $subscriptionId
az group deployment create -g $resourceGroupName \
--template-uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-managed-disks-performance-tiers/main/CreateUpdateDataDiskWithTier.json" \
--parameters "region=$region" "diskName=$diskName" "performanceTier=$performanceTier" "dataDiskSizeInGb=$diskSize"
```

## Azure disk bursting

For unplanned scenarios where you need high performance for a short period of time, you can benefit from the disk bursting capabilities. Disk bursting can improve boot times, manage processing of small-batch jobs, and deal with unexpected traffic spikes.

Azure provides this functionality both for VMs and the disks, and you can use it independently.

### Virtual machine-level bursting

VM bursting only supports the credit-based model for bursting, which doesn't require any configuration. During the VM usage, it accumulates credits whenever the resource's IOPS or throughputs are less than the resource's performance target. You can use these credits to burst performance for up to 30 minutes at the maximum burst rate.

### Disk bursting

Azure Premium SSDs offer two models of bursting:

- Credit-based bursting model. You can use this model for short-term performance scaling. This model is free and enabled by default on Premium SSDs 512 GiB disks and smaller. It uses accumulated credit to burst up to 30 minutes at the maximum burst rate.
- On-demand bursting model (currently in preview). This is configurable bursting for Premium SSDs larger than 512 GiB and comes with an additional cost. To configure on-demand bursting, you must detach the disk from the VM.

You can enable on-demand bursting by using PowerShell, Azure CLI, or Azure Resource Manager templates. You can enable this functionality on new and existing disks.

Use the following command to create an empty data disk with on-demand bursting:

PowerShell

```powershell
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName "yourSubscriptionName"
$diskConfig = New-AzDiskConfig -Location "WestCentralUS" -CreateOption Empty -DiskSizeGB 1024 -SkuName Premium_LRS -BurstingEnabled $true
$dataDisk = New-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroupDisk" -DiskName "myDataDisk" -Disk $diskConfig
```

> [!Note]
> For applications where you need higher sustained performance, use the functionality to change the performance tier instead disk bursting. This option is more cost effective than disk bursting.


## Optimize performance and costs with optimal option 

Now that you understand how different performance indicators define the overall performance of the managed disk, let's examine some use case scenarios.

- Planned versus unplanned performance scaling: If you have a planned event needing a sustained increase in disk performance, such as in your case a marketing campagne, use performance tiers to better accommodate the increased load. However, if you are unable to plan ahead or accurately predict the performance pattern of your workloads, disk bursting would be a better choice as it provides you with a higher allowance beyond your provisioned target.
- Duration: For scenarios where high demand results from short-running jobs or jitters in IO scheduling, on-demand disk bursting will be more cost-efficient as you will only pay for the burst transactions. If your workload does not exceed the provisioned target, you only pay for the burst enablement fee, a small fraction of the disk cost. In contrast, if you expect your workload to burst for days or even longer, performance tiers will be the better option.

### Disk striping

You can improve the performance of the application if you choose multiple disks and stripe them together to get a combined higher IOPS and throughput limit. You can implement striping on Windows by using the Storage Spaces functionality, and on Linux by using Multiple Disk and Device Management (MDADM).

You can modify the stripe size based on the application type and requirements. A smaller stripe size provides better performance for applications that use random small I/O patterns. Use a larger stripe size for a sequential large I/O pattern, which is commonly used in data warehouse applications.

### Multithreading

Applications that use multithreading improve the IOPS and throughput limits. A multithreaded application provides the benefit of multiple parallel jobs that multiple CPUs and multiple-core VMs can handle.

> [!Note]
> Remember that you can't modify how the application implements single threading or multithreading. You can still configure how multithreading alters the performance of the application. For example, you can configure the maximum number of processors that the application uses for parallel processing.

### Queue depth

The number of pending I/O requests in the system, known as queue depth, affects the performance indicators of your application.

For some workloads, a high disk queue depth is acceptable, but for others it should always remain very low. For example, a high disk queue requests more operations on the disk. Applications that support multithreading can achieve higher IOPS.

Azure queues I/O requests when reads or writes are requested faster than the disk can process them. When I/O requests are queued, the total amount of time it takes to read or write data to the disk will be greater. For example, if your application writes 300 IOPS and the disk is capable of accepting 500+ IOPS, then the queue depth doesn't occur.  However, if your application sends I/O requests that are greater than the disk's IOPS limit, Azure will use the queue depth.

Most applications don't allow you to change the queue depth because incorrect tuning of the queue depth can degrade the performance of the application. Applications that provide settings to tune the queue depth also allow you to configure their multithreading. For example, the MAXDOP (maximum degree of parallelism) setting in SQL Server specifies how many cores to use for running the query.
