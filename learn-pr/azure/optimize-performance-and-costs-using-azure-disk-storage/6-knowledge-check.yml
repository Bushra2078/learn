  questions:
 
  - content: "You need the best disk performance for a new virtual machine. What disk type should you use, assuming all disk types are supported in your region?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ultra disks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Ultra SSDs offer the best performance of disk types on Azure."
    - content: "Standard HDD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Standard HDDs are cost effective solution, but they don't perform as well as premium SSDs or ultra disks."
    - content: "Premium SSD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Premium SSDs have excellent performance, but do not offer the best performance of disk types on Azure."
 
  - content: "You need to choose the right disk for your SQL server that is running in Azure VM to support at minimum 1100 IOPS of 1,100 at all times. How would this requirement change the disk type you choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable read and write caching on standard SSD disk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although caching generally improve the IOPS performance it does not garranty the minimum required IOPS value."
    - content: "Use standard HDDs instead of standard SSDs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Standard SSDs and standard HDDs don't guarantee an IOPS value."
    - content: "Use premium SSDs instead of standard SSDs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Premium SSDs and ultra disks have a guaranteed performance level."
 
  - content: "As administrator you plans to create an Azure VM that will run application that periodically require change in the performance. Which of the following you can use to achieve this to meet application requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Disk bursting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although disk bursting can be used to improve the application performance, this is usually used for unplanned scenarios."
    - content: "Use ultra disk and change the performance tier."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can change the performance tier on ultra and premium SSD disks when you need to meet a higher performance demand."
    - content: "Use read/write caching on the disk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although caching generally improve the IOPS performance it cannot be used in scenario when we need to change the performance tier for the disk."
