  questions:
 
  - content: "An administrator needs to select a disk type that provides the highest disk IOPS for a new VM. Which disk type should the administrator use assuming all disk types are supported in their region?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ultra Disks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Ultra SSDs offer the best performance of disk types on Azure."
    - content: "Standard HDD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Standard HDDs are a cost-effective solution, but they don't perform as well as Premium SSDs or Ultra Disks."
    - content: "Premium SSD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Premium SSDs provide high performance, but don't offer the best performance of all the available disk types in Azure."
 
  - content: "You are running an application on an Azure VM that requires 15,000 IOPS. You've provisioned an Azure VM with the Standard_D8s_v3 tier, that provides 12,800 IOPS, P30 OS disk with 5,000 IOPS and two P30 data disks, each with 5,000 IOPS. Which of the following is true? "
    choices:
    - content: "You have met the demands of the application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The maximum IOPS that application will get is limited by the virtual machine limits and is 12,800 IOPS."
    - content: "VM IO capping prevent application to receive the demanding IOPS."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The application is capped by the virtual machine limits and must allocate the allotted 12,800 IOPS."
    - content: "Disk IO capping prevent application to receive the demanding IOPS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All attached disks are P30 disks that can handle 5,000 IOPS. So, they respond back with their requested amounts, but in this case VM IO capping prevent application to achieve demanding IOPS."
 
  - content: "As administrator plans to create an Azure VM to run Marketing application. You have a planned marketing event, that need a sustained increase in disk performance. Which of the performance scaling, can be used by the administrator to meet application requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use disk bursting."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although the administrator can use disk bursting to improve the application performance, this is usually used for unplanned scenarios."
    - content: "Use Ultra SSDs or Premium SSDs and change the performance tier."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An administrator can change the performance tier on Ultra and Premium SSD disks when they need to meet a higher performance demand."
    - content: "Use read/write caching on the disk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although caching generally improves the IOPS performance, it can't be used in scenarios when you need to change the performance tier for the disk."
