## Title

Build a Node.js app for Azure Cosmos DB in Visual Studio Code

## Role(s)

- Developer

## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Cosmos DB
- VS Code

## Prerequisites

- VS Code with Azure extensions installed
- Node.js installed

## Summary

Build a database app to store and query data in Azure Cosmos DB by using Visual Studio Code and Node.js.

## Learning objectives

1. Create a Cosmos DB instance for a Node.js app
2. Set up a new Node.js app in VS Code
3. Add JavaScript code to work with Cosmos DB
4. Create and run Cosmos DB stored procedures from your app

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Create a Cosmos DB instance for a Node.js app | Create a Cosmos DB instance for a Node.js app | Exercise | Create a Cosmos DB instance for a Node.js app | Yes |
| Set up a new Node.js app in VS Code | Set up a new Node.js app in VS Code | Exercise | Set up a new Node.js app in VS Code | Yes |
| Add JavaScript code to work with Cosmos DB | Add JavaScript code to work with Cosmos DB | Exercise | Add JavaScript code to work with Cosmos DB | Yes |
| Create and run Cosmos DB stored procedures from your app | Create and run Cosmos DB stored procedures from your app | Exercise | Create and run Cosmos DB stored procedures from your app | Yes |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice (from the module proposal):

    *Add your scenario [(Guidance)](id-guidance-scenarios.md)*

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    1. Step
    1. Step

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

## Notes
- This is effectively a port of https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-cosmos-db-app-with-vscode/, for which we are not adding a pivot for a few reasons. The content of this module should not be lifted straight from the other module, but I don't expect them to be substantially different, except around the differing concerns between Node and .NET.
  - Note that the other module was created prior to our "conceptual unit/exercise unit" structure, which should be followed for this new module.
- This module is for rank beginners. No real Node expertise is expected of the audience, but you don't need to explain what Node is - the assumption is that they've learned enough to want to create a Node app that uses real cloud infrastructure.
- Similar to the other module, create a console app that can be run in the cloud shell.
