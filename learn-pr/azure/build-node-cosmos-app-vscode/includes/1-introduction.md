Node.js is a popular platform for building JavaScript applications that run outside the confines of a web browser. Visual Studio Code provides an development environment you can use to create and document applications written in a variety of languages, including JavaScript. Many Visual Studio Code extensions are available to support integration with popular frameworks and services, including Azure Databases. You can use the Azure Databases extension to create and manage Cosmos DB databases, containers, and documents. Connect to a Cosmos DB database from a Node.js application using the `@azure/cosmos` JavaScript module.

Imagine you work as a software developer that builds applications for the fictitious outdoor company **Contoso**. You've been asked to apply product discounts. Contoso uses Cosmos DB to store the information about their retail store including products. Use Visual Studio Code to develop your JavaScript application to apply the discounts to the products. 

In this module, you'll learn how to work with a Cosmos DB from Visual Studio Code to work with the Contoso database. Finally, you'll learn how to insert, update, delete, and query products in a Cosmos DB container.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to use Node.js with Visual Studio Code to create and run Cosmos DB applications.
