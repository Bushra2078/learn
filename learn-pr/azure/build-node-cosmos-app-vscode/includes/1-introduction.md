Node.js is a popular platform for building JavaScript applications that run outside of the confines of a web browser. Visual Studio Code provides an environment that you can use to develop and document applications written in a variety of languages. Many extensions are available that support integration with a range of frameworks and services, including Azure Cosmos DB. You can use the Azure Cosmos DB extension to create and manage Cosmos DB databases and documents, and you can connect to a Cosmos DB database from a Node.js application using the `azure/cosmos` JavaScript module.

Imagine that you work as a software developer for a systems house that builds applications for schools. You've been asked to develop an application that keeps track of students' grades for the various courses they've taken. You decide to use Cosmos DB to store the information about course grades. The application must be portable, so you decide to use JavaScript running in Node.js. You also decide to use Visual Studio Code as the development environment.

In this module, you'll learn about how to build databases and collections with Cosmos DB. You'll use Visual Studio Code, as a tool for managing Cosmos DB, and as a development environment for building the course grades application. You'll learn how to insert, update, delete, and query documents in a Cosmos DB collection, and you'll see how to create and run JavaScript stored procedures from a Node.js application.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Node.js with Visual Studio Code to create and run Cosmos DB applications.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create a Cosmos DB instance for a Node.js app
- Set up a new Node.js app in VS Code
- Add JavaScript code to work with Cosmos DB
- Create and run Cosmos DB stored procedures from your app

## Prerequisites

- VS Code with Azure extensions installed
- Node.js installed
