In this module, you'll learn how to create and manage a Cosmos DB Core (SQL) database and container with the Azure JavaScript SDK for Cosmos DB. **Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL)** provides for data management of JSON documents using  Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax.

## Example scenario

Imagine you are a software developer for the fictitious outdoor equipment company **Contoso**. You've been asked to create a new Cosmos DB resource, and upload the products JSON dataset. Once the dataset is uploaded in a container, you need to be able to find products and their inventory levels, and update products. 

You'll learn how to work with a Cosmos DB resource, database, and container from Visual Studio Code and the JavaScript SDK to insert, find, and update products.

## What will you be doing? 

You'll use Visual Studio Code and the Azure extension for Cosmos DB to create your database and add then delete some dummy data. Then you'll create the Node.js application and the learn how to programmatically accomplish those tasks.

These steps include:

* Create Cosmos DB Core (SQL) resource.
* Manually add, update, and delete documents from Azure explorer in Visual Studio Code.
* Use JavaScript to automate data tasks with the @azure/cosmos npm package.

## What is the main goal? 

The main goal is to teach you how to interact with your Cosmos DB Core (SQL) container programmatically with the JavaScript SDK. The programmatic tasks are intermediary. 

If you start the module and feel you aren't ready for these tasks, complete to the Cosmos DB Core (SQL) quickstart then return to this module. 

## Prerequisites

Your local development machine should have the following installed before you continue:

* Node.js LTS version
* Visual Studio Code and the following extensions: 
    * Azure Account
    * Azure Resources
