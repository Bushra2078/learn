The Azure Cosmos DB extension enables you to create and manage Cosmos DB databases, containers, and documents from within VS Code.

In the sample scenario, you want to work within VS Code, both as a development environment for building applications, and as a tool for managing your Cosmos DB databases.

In this exercise, you'll install the Cosmos DB extension for VS Code. Then you'll use the extension to connect to your Azure account and create a Cosmos DB account. You'll add a database and container for holding students' course grade information to the Cosmos DB account. Finally, you'll create some test documents in the container, then view and update them.

This exercise runs on your desktop computer, and uses an Azure sandbox for your resources.

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise assumes that you've already installed **Visual Studio Code** on your desktop computer.

## Install the Cosmos DB extension for Visual Studio Code

1. Start VS Code.

2. On the **View** menu, select **Extensions** to open the extensions pane.

3. In the **Search Extensions in Marketplace** box, type **Cosmos DB**, and press Enter.

4. In the list of extensions, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** extension published by Microsoft, and click **Install**.

5. Wait while the extension is installed.

## Create a Cosmos DB account

1. On the **View** menu, select **Command Palette**.

2. In the command palette, type **Azure**, and then select **Azure: Focus on Cosmos DB View**.

    ![Screenshot of the command palette in VS Code. The user has selected the **Focus on Cosmos DB View** command](../media/3-command-palette-cosmosdb.png)

    The Azure Cosmos DB pane will appear.

3. In the Cosmos DB pane, click **Sign in to Azure**.

4. Sign in with the same credentials you used to set up the sandbox and then close the browser page.

5. In the command palette, type **Azure**, and then select **Azure: Select Subscriptions**. Select **Concierge Subscription**, and then click **OK**.

6. In the toolbar above the Cosmos DB pane, click **Create Account** (the **+** sign).

    ![Screenshot of the Cosmos DB pane in VS Code. The user has selected the **Create Account** command](../media/3-add-comsosdb-account.png)

    A wizard will start that prompts you for the details of the new account.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Cosmos DB account must have a unique name. We suggest using something like **\<*your name or initials*\>school**. Use this name wherever you see *\<your-cosmos-db-account-name\>* in this exercise.

7. In the **Account name** box, type **\<your-cosmos-db-account-name\>**, and then press Enter.

8. In the **Select an API for your Cosmos DB account** list, select **SQL (DocumentDB)**.

9. In the **Select a resource group for new resources** list, select the existing resource group created in the Azure sandbox (it will have a name that starts with **learn-** followed by a GUID), and then press Enter.

10. In the **Select a location for new resources** list, select your nearest location.

11. Wait while the Cosmos DB account is created.

12. When the account has been created, in the Cosmos DB pane, expand your Azure account. Verify that the new Cosmos DB account appears:

## Create a database and container

1. In the Cosmos DB pane, right-click *\<your-cosmos-db-account-name\>*, and then click **Create Database**.

    ![Screenshot of the Cosmos DB pane in VS Code. The user has selected the **Create Database** command for the Cosmos DB account](../media/3-cosmosdb-create-database.png)

2. In the **Database Name** box, type **SchoolDB**, and then press Enter.

3. In the **Enter an id for your collection** box, enter **StudentCourseGrades**, and then press Enter.

4. In the **Enter the partition key for the collection** box, type **StudentID**, and then press Enter.

    This container will hold `StudentCourseGrades` documents. Course grades will be held as an array of subdocuments with each student. The data will be partitioned by student ID.

5. In the **Initial throughput capacity** box, accept the default value of **1000**, and then press Enter.

6. Verify that the **SchoolDB** database, containing the **StudentCourseGrades** container, appears.

## Create and view documents

1. In the Cosmos DB pane, expand the **StudentCourseGrades** container. Two subfolders should appear, named **Documents** and **Stored Procedures**.

2. Right-click the **Documents** folder, and then click **Create Document**.

    ![Screenshot of the Cosmos DB pane in VS Code. The user has selected the **Create Document** command in the **StudentCourseGrades** container](../media/3-create-document.png)

3. In the **Enter a document ID** box, type **S101**, and then press Enter. This will be the ID of a student document.

4. In the **Enter a value for the partition key** box, type **101**, and then press Enter.

    The document will be created and displayed in VS Code, in JSON format. The **id** and **StudentID** fields will be populated with the values you specified. The document will also contain other fields that are added automatically by Cosmos DB for its own internal use.

    ![Screenshot of VS Code showing the newly created document](../media/3-new-document.png)

5. In the Cosmos DB pane, right-click the **Documents** folder again, and then click **Create Document**.

6. In the **Enter a document ID** box, type **S102**, and then press Enter. This will be the ID of another student.

7. In the **Enter a value for the partition key** box, type **102**, and then press Enter.

    The new document will appear.

## Edit documents

1. In the **Documents** list, select the **S101** document.

2. In the JSON document that appears, move to the end of the **StudentID** line, and press Enter.

3. Add the following fields to the document. Don't forget to add a comma at the end of each line:

    ```JSON
    "Forename": "AAA",
    "Lastname": "BBB",
    ```

4. Right-click anywhere in the document pane, and then click **Update to Cloud**.

    ![Screenshot of VS Code showing the edited document. The student has selected the **Update to Cloud** command to save the changes back to Cosmos DB](../media/3-save-changes.png)

    The document will be written back to Cosmos DB. The VS Code log window will appear. The final message in the log should be similar to the following example:

    ```text
    10:51:56: Updated entity "csschool (SQL)/SchoolDB/StudentCourseGrades/Documents/S101"
    ```

5. In the **Documents** list, select the **S102** document.

6. Add the following fields to the document after the **StudentID** field, and then save the updated document to the cloud:

    ```JSON
    "Forename": "CCC",
    "Lastname": "DDD",
    ```

7. In the **Documents** list, select the **S101** document again.

8. Add the following field to the document, after the **Lastname** field:

    ```JSON
    "CourseGrades": [
        {
            "Course": "Computer Science",
            "Grade": "A"
        },
        {
            "Course": "Applied Mathematics",
            "Grade": "B"
        }
    ],
    ```

    This is an array field that contains the grades for each course that the student has taken. Each pair of **Course**/**Grade** fields is a subdocument. Using an array makes it possible to record the details of a variable number of courses for each student.

9. Save the updated document to the cloud.

10. Edit the **S102** document, add the following fields, and save the updated document to the cloud:

    ```JSON
    "CourseGrades": [
        {
            "Course": "Computer Science",
            "Grade": "C"
        }
    ],
    ```

    This student has only taken the Computer Science course.

You've now used the Cosmos DB extension in VS Code to create a Cosmos DB database and container. You've added and viewed documents, and you've edited these documents.
