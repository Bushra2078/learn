In the past, your company's operations team was faced with the tasks of creating virtual machines for your public-facing web servers, and then manually installing and configuring the software that is necessary to create your company's web server infrastructure. In order to reduce the time that it takes to bring new virtual machines online and to reduce setup costs, your team wanted you to research how Azure could help you to improve your methodology for the installation and configuration of web server software.

In this module, you've seen some of the tools that are available on Azure to automate the creation of Linux and Windows virtual machines, with all of the required infrastructure that's necessary to host dynamic content on your web servers. Azure has helped you to simply your team's processes, and your team is more productive and efficient. Your team can deliver a great experience to your customers by guaranteeing their servers are UP and running, and configured correctly.

As an alternative to creating your virtual machines and automating the installation and configuration of your business components, you might consider creating virtual machines using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. ARM templates a quick way to deploy the infrastructure that you need with a single Azure CLI or PowerShell command. You can create templates in two ways: you can create a template from an existing Azure deployment, or you can use a pre-built template from the Azure Quickstart Template gallery.
