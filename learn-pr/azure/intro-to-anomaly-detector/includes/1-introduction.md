The Azure Anomaly Detector service is a cloud-based service that helps you monitor and detect abnormalities in your time series data.

A pharmaceutical company stores medications in long-term storage facilities. The medications require that the temperature remains with a specific range. Prolonged periods where the temperature has risen above a certain measured value, can have negative effects on the medication, and requires the company to verify the integrity of the stored medications.

Your task is to investigate a solution that you have heard about, called anomaly detection. You want to verify if the Anomaly Detector service is the right choice. You will evaluate if it is capable of monitoring the temperature sensor readings in real time, but also to see if it can evaluate historical data as well.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe what anomaly detection is
- Describe how Anomaly Detector can evaluate time series data
- Define scenarios where anomaly detection can be applied
- Decide if Anomaly Detector is the right choice for your scenario

## Prerequisites

- Ability to navigate the Azure portal
- Foundational knowledge of Azure services
- Foundational knowledge of REST
