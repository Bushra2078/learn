In this module, you've explored the different Azure command line tool options that allow you to
automate the provisioning of Azure resources at scale. You've learned the basic concepts of

Terraform.

Knowing the capabilities and seeing the syntax for each Azure command line tool empowers you to be
able to make an informed decision about which tools best meet the needs of your requirements.
