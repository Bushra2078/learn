In the accounting firm scenario, your organization is using Azure Virtual Desktop to provide your workforce access to virtualized desktops and apps.

So, in this unit, you create a host pool and add a VM that will act as a session host. To avoid having to domain join the VM, you manually install the Azure Virtual Desktop agent and boot loader to register the VM to the host pool. You'll then have an Azure Virtual Desktop deployment that you can use in the rest of the module exercises.

## Create a host pool for Azure Virtual Desktop

Next, let's create a host pool that will contain the VM you'll create later in this exercise.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. Search for and select **Azure Virtual Desktop**.
1. Select **Create a host pool**.
1. Enter the following information into the **Basics** tab.

   |Field  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Subscription     |  Your subscription      |
   |Resource group     | Create a new resource group named learn-firewall-rg    |
   |Host pool name     | learn-host-pool      |
   |Location    | Region near you       |
   |Host pool type     |  Pooled  |
   |Load balancing algorithm    | Breadth-first |
   |Max session limit    |2|

   Leave any other default values as they are.
1. Select **Review + create** > **Create**.

## Create a registration token for the host pool

Create a registration token to authorize a session host to join the host pool.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to create a registration token that will expire in 4 hours.

   ```powershell
    $resourceGroup = 'learn-firewall-rg'
    $hostPoolName = 'learn-host-pool' 
    $regToken = New-AzWvdRegistrationInfo `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
    -HostPoolName $hostPoolName `
    -ExpirationTime $((get-date).ToUniversalTime().AddHours(4).ToString('yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ'))
   ```

1. Run the following command to get the registration token.

   ```powershell
    $regToken.Token
   ```

1. Copy the token to a note app like Notepad.  

## Create a subnet and virtual network for the host pool

In Cloud Shell, run the following command to create a subnet and virtual network in the same location as the resource group.

   ```powershell
   $subnetConfig = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
   -Name hostSubnet `
   -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24

   $location = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name learn-firewall-rg

   $virtualNetwork = New-AzVirtualNetwork `
   -Name hostVNet `
   -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 `
   -Location $location.Location `
   -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
   -Subnet $subnetConfig

   ```

   This list shows some location values you can use:

Ignore the warning message about upcoming breaking changes. It doesn't apply to the command you're running.

## Create a session host for the host pool

Create an Azure VM to act as a session host for the host pool.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to set the user name and password for the administrator account on the VM. The password needs to be at least eight characters long and include a digit, an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a special character. Write down the password because you'll need it later.

    ```powershell
    $cred = Get-Credential

    ```

1. Run the following command to create the VM using a Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session image.

    ```powershell
    New-Azvm `
    -Name 'learn-host-vm' `
    -Credential $cred `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
    -Size 'Standard_DS1_v2' `
    -VirtualNetworkName hostVNet `
    -SubnetName hostSubnet `
    -Image "MicrosoftWindowsDesktop:Windows-10:20h1-evd-g2:latest" 

    ```

   Ignore message "No size value has been provided..." The VM will be created with the size you specified in the command above.

1. Wait a couple of minutes for the VM to be created.

## Connect to the VM by using a remote desktop session

Use a remote desktop session to sign into the VM you created in the previous section.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual machines**.
1. Select **learn-host-vm**.
1. Select **Connect** > **RDP**.
1. Select **Download RDP File** > **Open file** > **Connect**.
1. In the **Windows Security** window, select **More choices** > **Use a different account**.
1. Enter the user name and the password you used when you created the VM, and then select **OK**.
1. If you're asked to connect despite certificate errors, select **Yes**.

## Register the virtual machine with host pool

Install the Azure Virtual Desktop agent and boot loader on the VM to register the VM to the host pool.

### Install the agent

In your remote desktop session on the VM, install the  Azure Virtual Desktop agent. You'll need the registration token for the host pool to complete the installation.

1. Copy the following link to the Azure Virtual Desktop agent: https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWrmXv
1. On the VM, open Microsoft Edge to start a web browser session.
1. Paste the link into a web browser.
1. At the bottom of the web browser window, select **Open file** to install the Azure Virtual Desktop agent.
1. When the installer asks you for the registration token, paste in the value you got after you created the token.
1. If you no longer have the token value, go back to your Cloud Shell session and run the following command.

   ```powershell
    (Get-AzWvdRegistrationInfo `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
    -HostPoolName $hostPoolName).Token
   ```

1. Complete the installation.

### Install the boot loader

In your remote desktop session on the VM, install the  Azure Virtual Desktop boot loader.

1. Copy the following link to the Azure Virtual Desktop boot loader: https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWrxrH
1. Paste the link into a web browser session in the VM.
1. At the bottom of the web browser window, select **Open file** to install the Azure Virtual Desktop boot loader.
1. Complete the installation.
1. Close the remote desktop session.

## Check your work

At this point, the virtual machine should be registered as a session host for the host pool. To verify it's registered, let's sign into the portal and check the VM in the host pool.

1. In the Azure portal, search for or select **Azure Virtual Desktop**.
1. Select **Host pools** > **learn-host-pool**.
1. In the center pane, under **Virtual machines**, select **Total machines**.
:::image type="content" source="../media/3-host-pool-overview-vms.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the host pool overview page with the total machines button in the center pane.":::
1. You see that **learn-host-vm** is registered with the host pool.
1. Select **learn-host-vm**.
1. If you get a **Not found** error, wait a few minutes and try again.
1. Under **Status**, select **ViewDetails**.
:::image type="content" source="../media/3-host-pool-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the status of the host pool and the link to view status details.":::
1. The health check **"DomainJoinedCheck"** failed as we didn't domain join the VM. But the rest of the health checks succeeded.
