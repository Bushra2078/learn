## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a large accounting firm where you've just deployed a Windows Virtual Desktop host pool. Your organization is using Windows Virtual Desktop to provide your workforce access to virtualized desktops and apps including some legacy apps. Because of the sensitive data your organization works with and your organization's network security requirements, network security is very important to you. You can't have any unauthorized network traffic in your Windows Virtual Desktop environment. You want to start by limiting outbound network traffic for Windows Virtual Desktop by using Azure Firewall.
