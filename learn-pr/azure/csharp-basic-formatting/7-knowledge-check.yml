  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following escape sequences would you use to add double-quotes to your literal string?"
    choices:
    - content: "&#92;q"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "&#92;q isn't a valid escape sequence."
    - content: "&#92;d"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "&#92;d isn't a valid escape sequence."
    - content: "&#92;'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "&#92;' is the escape sequence for a single quote, not a double-quote."
    - content: '&#92;"'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code correctly uses string interpolation assuming that the variable `value` is a string?"
    choices:
    - content: '`Console.WriteLine(@"My value: {value}");`'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This line uses the `@` symbol instead of the `$` symbol as the prefix for string interpolation."
    - content: '`Console.WriteLine($"My value: {value}");`'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"      
    - content: '`Console.WriteLine(@"My value: [value]");`'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This line uses square brackets instead of curly braces for the interpolation expression."
    - content: '`Console.WriteLine("My value: {value}");`'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This line is missing the `$` symbol prefix for string interpolation."
  - content: "You embedded Unicode characters in your strings to present a special message in Thai, however the message is only displayed as question mark characters.  What happened?"
    choices:
    - content: "You're missing the &#92;u escape sequence for Unicode characters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If you don't use the &#92;u escape sequence for Unicode characters, you won't see question marks.  You'll see the numbers."
    - content: "You used the wrong Unicode characters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is unlikely.  It would only be true if all the Unicode characters were the same value representing a quotation mark -- &#92;u003F."
    - content: "The user's console doesn't support Unicode characters."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Thai can't be represented in Unicode."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect.  Thai characters can be represented in Unicode."
