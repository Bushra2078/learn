  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: How do you create a dependency between two or more resources?
      choices:
        - content: Create a _resources_ attribute on the parent resource. Add the child resource as a value of the _resources_ attribute you created. 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: What's described is a parent-child relationship. It does not create a dependency by itself. You still have to add a _dependsOn_ construct on the child resource and point to the parent resource.
        - content: Create a _dependencies_ attribute on the dependent resource. Add the resource you depend on as a value to the _dependencies_ attribute.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: There's no _dependencies_ attribute.
        - content: Add a _dependants_ construct on a resource. As value, add the resources that depend on this resource.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The dependency is created by adding a _dependsOn_ construct on the dependent resource and pointing out the resource you depend on to be created first.
        - content: Add a _dependsOn_ construct on a resource and add the name or ID of the resource it depends on.
          isCorrect: true
    - content: A condition element is used to?
      choices:
        - content: Conditionally set values on a resource's attribute.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Conditionally run shell commands in your ARM template.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Conditionally deploy a resource.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Add conditional child resources to a parent resource.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: How do you get the current index in a _copy_ iteration?
      choices:
        - content: Refer to the `$index` field within the _copy_ element.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: You use the `copyIndex()` function. 
          isCorrect: true
        - content: The `index()` function is what you need. 
          isCorrect:  false
        - content: There's a `currentIndex()` function that returns the current index value.
