## Create the ARM template

Here, you create an ARM template that defines a storage account resource. The template uses _copy_ to create similar versions of the same resource a given number of times.

1. In Visual Studio Code, create a file named *copy.json* in the same directory that contains *azuredeploy.json*.
1. Add these contents to *copy.json*:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {
        "storageCount": {
          "type": "int",
          "defaultValue": 1,
          "metadata": {
            "description": "the number of storage accounts being deployed"
          }
        },
        "storageAccountName": {
          "type": "string",
          "defaultValue": "storage",
          "metadata": {
            "description": "the name of the storage account"
          }
        }
      },
      "functions": [],
      "variables": {},
      "resources": [
        {
          "name": "[concat(parameters('storageAccountName'), copyIndex())]",
          "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
          "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
          "tags": {
            "displayName": "storageaccount1"
          },
          "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
          "kind": "StorageV2",
          "sku": {
            "name": "Premium_LRS",
            "tier": "Premium"
          },
          "copy": {
            "name": "storagecopy",
            "count": "[parameters('storageCount')]"
          }
        }
      ],
      "outputs": {}
    }
    ```

The `storageCount` parameter defines the number of copies to create.

Under `resources`, note the storage account resource. To make the storage account name unique, the template uses `copyIndex()` to append the current index to the storage account name.

The `copy` section reads the number of copies to make from the `storageCount` parameter.

## Deploy the template

Here, you deploy the template as you did previously. The deployment step provisions two similar storage accounts.

1. Create a PowerShell variable that holds the storage account name.

    ```powershell
    $STORAGE_ACCT_NAME="tailwindsa" + (Get-Random -Count 1)
    ```

1. Run the following `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment` command to deploy the template:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
    -TemplateFile "./copy.json" `
    -storageAccountName $STORAGE_ACCT_NAME `
    -storageCount 2
    ```

    Here, you set `storageCount` to 2 to provision two storage accounts.

## Verify the deployment

Although the output shows that two storage accounts were created, here you run the `az deployment group show` command to focus on the output resources.

1. Run the following `invoke-expression` command to display details about the deployment:

    TODO: this doesn't work


    ```powershell
    invoke-expression (Get-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name copy -ResourceGroupName <rgn>your resource group</rgn>).outputs.id
    ```

    The `invoke-expression` argument specifies to show just the identifiers from the output resources.

    Your output resembles this:

    ```output
    /subscriptions/4b328dc1-56b1-4031-89b0-c0898204f8a5/resourceGroups/<rgn>resource group name</rgn>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/tailwindsa9820
    /subscriptions/4b328dc1-56b1-4031-89b0-c0898204f8a5/resourceGroups/<rgn>resource group name</rgn>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/tailwindsa9821
    ```

    In this example:

    * **tailwindsa982** is the base name that was generated for the storage account (`tailwindsa$RANDOM`).
    * **tailwindsa9820** (the base name plus "0") is the first storage account.
    * **tailwindsa9821** (the base name plus "1") is the second storage account.

Great work! As your needs change, such as the performance tier you need, you can modify your resource definitions from a single location.
