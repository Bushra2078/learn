title: Manage complex cloud deployments by using advanced ARM template features
summary: This module teaches you how to use advanced Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template features to perform secrets management and conditional deployments.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  - Control the deployment order of resources by using the _dependsOn_ construct.
  - Securely assign secrets like passwords to resources in your templates by using an Azure Key Vault and ARM template configuration.
  - Conditionally deploy resources by using the _condition_ construct and parameters at deployment time.
  - Deploy multiple resources of the same type by using the _copy_ construct and to reduce repetitive configuration.
