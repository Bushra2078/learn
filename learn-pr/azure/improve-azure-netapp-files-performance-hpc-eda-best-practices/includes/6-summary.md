Recall that you're using Azure NetApp Files as the back-end storage solution to run your HPC/EDA applications on Azure. And you'll need to know the performance tips and best practices to improve Azure NetApp Files performance of your EDA Applications.

In this module, we introduced overall performance suggestions regarding reference architecture, client VMs, and network. Then, we listed and discussed several performance tips including mounting options and client VM configurations. Finally, we examined the SPEC EDA and FIO benchmarking results to verify the performance tips we discussed.

Now you should be able to list and describe the performance practices that help to improve Azure NetApp Files performance of your HPC/EDA applications.
