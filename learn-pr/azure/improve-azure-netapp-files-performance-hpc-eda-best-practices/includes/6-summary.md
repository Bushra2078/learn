Recall that you're using Azure NetApp Files as the back-end storage solution to run your HPC and EDA applications on Azure. And you need to know performance tips and best practices to improve Azure NetApp Files performance for your EDA applications.

In this module, we introduced performance suggestions for reference architecture, client VMs, and network. We then discussed several performance tips, including mount options and client VM configurations. Finally, we examined the SPEC EDA and FIO benchmark results to verify the performance tips that we discussed.

Now, you should be able to list and describe the performance practices that help to improve Azure NetApp Files performance for your HPC and EDA applications.
