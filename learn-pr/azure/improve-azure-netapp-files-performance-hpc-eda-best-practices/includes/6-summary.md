Recall that you're using Azure NetApp Files as the back-end storage solution to run your HPC/EDA applications on Azure. And you'll need to know the performance tips and best practices to improve Azure NetApp Files performance of your EDA Applications.

In this module, we first introduce overall performance suggestions regarding reference architecture, client VMs, and network.

And then we list and discuss several performance tips including mounting options and client VM configurations.

Finally, we examine the SPEC EDA and FIO benchmarking results to verify the performance tips we discussed.

Now you should be able to list and describe the performance practice which would help to improve Azure NetApp Files performance of your HPC/EDA applications.
