  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following reasons enables IoT Edge to distribute AI workloads to the Edge?"
    choices:
    - content: "IoT Edge allows you to deploy models built and trained in the cloud and run them on edge devices"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The ability to deploy models on the Edge allows the model to process data locally and respond to the event rapidly"
    - content: "IoT Edge can optimize the network functionality"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The capabilities of the underlying network do not directly enable IoT Edge to run distributed workloads"
    - content: "IoT Edge can work with sensors on edge devices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The ability to connect to sensors doesn't enable IoT Edge  to run distributed workloads"
  - content: "What is the main advantage of using Azure Cognitive services?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your models will run faster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Your models wouldn't necessarily run faster without Azure Cognitive services"
    - content: "You could gain access to prebuilt models"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure cognitive services enable you to access prebuilt models"
    - content: "You could use any hardware"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure cognitive services don't require the use of specific hardware"
