  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Are all user and system flows always equally important?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. Not all user and system flows are equally important."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For example, asynchronous flows might have lower requirements regarding performance or availability."
    - content: "No. Some flows might have lower requirements."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "For example, batch processing or asynchronous flows might have lower requirements regarding performance and availability."
  - content: "Does an outage of a component always result in a service degradation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. Some components might not cause a service degradation when they fail."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For example, non-user facing or background and batch processing components might not cause a service degradation when they fail."
    - content: "No. Not all components have the same requirements regarding availability and performance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "For example, an outage of a component that isn't user facing might not result in a service degradation."
  - content: "Can a load test help to evaluate the expected performance of a user flow?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. A load test can help to identity the performance of a user flow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A load test can help to identity the performance, performance limits, resource utilization, and the optimal scaling behavior of components that build a user flow."
    - content: "No. A load test can't help to identity the performance of a user flow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A load test can help to evaluate the expected performance of a user flow."
