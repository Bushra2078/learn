quiz:
  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "How many different baselines are required?"
    choices:
    - content: "A single baseline is always enough."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The baseline definition of what good or healthy means can differ based on the environment or stage, on the load profile as well as on the fact if Chaos Experiments were done during the test."
    - content: "Different baselines for different scenarios."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Different scenarios might require different baselines. Examples are different performance requirements and expectations in different stages and environments. Running Chaos experiments can also have an impact on the expected performance."
  - content: "The baseline defines the performance the deployment can provide."
    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The baseline defines what performance numbers are expected, it has no impact on the performance that is provided."
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The baseline has no impact on the performance."
  - content: "When do baselines need to be evaluated and updated?"
    choices:
    - content: "Baselines do not need to be updated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Baselines need to be evaluated on a regular basis and need to be updated to reflect changes in the application or infrastructure that affect the performance."
    - content: "As part of every release or major change."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Existing baselines should be evaluated with every release or major change and adjusted when needed."
    - content: "Baselines should be updated on a yearly basis."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Defining a specific interval is not recommended. Baselines should be evaluated on a regular basis, for example, as part of every release and as part of major changes."
