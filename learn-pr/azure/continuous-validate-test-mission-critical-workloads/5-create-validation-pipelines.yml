  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "How can a load test and chaos experiments be executed and orchestrated?"
    choices:
    - content: "Manually via the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although it's technically possible to use the Azure portal, it isn't recommended. Because continuous validation benefits from being used frequently, the process should be automated so that it's easily accessible for all developers."
    - content: "Embedded into a pipeline or workflow"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Load tests and chaos experiments should be embedded into a pipeline or workflow and made easily accessible for all developers."
    - content: "Chaos and load testing can't run in parallel."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Chaos experiments and load tests can be executed in parallel and the process should be automated."
  - content: "What needs to be done after a failed load test?"
    choices:
    - content: "Nothing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The results of a failed load test run should be analyzed and the baseline adjusted if needed."
    - content: "Use a different load test tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A failed load test is an indicator of issues introduced as part of a recent change, issues with the underlying platform, or a baseline and threshold that needs to be adjusted."
    - content: "Analyze the result and take action."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A failed load test is an indicator of issues introduced as part of a recent change, issues with the underlying platform, or a baseline and threshold that needs to be adjusted."
