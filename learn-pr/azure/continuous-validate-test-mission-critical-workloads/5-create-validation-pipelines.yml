  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "How should a load test and a chaos experiment be run and orchestrated?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should be run and orchestrated manually via the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although it's technically possible to use the Azure portal, we don't recommend it. Because continuous validation benefits from frequent use, the process should be automated so that it's easily accessible to all developers."
    - content: "They should be embedded into a pipeline or workflow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Load tests and chaos experiments should be embedded into a pipeline or workflow and made easily accessible to all developers."
    - content: "Load tests and chaos experiments can't be run in parallel."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Load tests and chaos experiments can be run in parallel, and the process should be automated."
  - content: "What needs to be done after a failed load test?"
    choices:
    - content: "No action is needed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's important to analyze the results of a failed load test and adjust the baseline if needed."
    - content: "Use a different load test tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A failed load test can indicate problems introduced as part of a recent change, problems with the underlying platform, or the need to adjust a baseline and a threshold."
    - content: "Analyze the result and take action."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A failed load test can indicate problems introduced as part of a recent change, problems with the underlying platform, or the need to adjust a baseline and a threshold."
