title: Continuously validate and test mission-critical workloads
summary: A mission-critical workload needs to stay operational, even when failures occur. Before you deploy a workload to production, you want to evaluate the impact of changes, along with the system's ability to handle loads and failures. In this module, you'll learn how to achieve these goals by using Azure Load Testing and Azure Chaos Studio simultaneously as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
abstract:  | 
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Explain the importance of user flows and system flows as the foundation for defining load tests and chaos experiments.
  - Establish baselines for load tests with expected thresholds for system components, individual user flows, and the overall solution.
  -	Identify potential failure scenarios for system components as a guide for designing chaos experiments.
  - Implement an automated process for continuous validation in your CI/CD pipeline.
prerequisites: |
  - Extensive experience in designing cloud-native applications that include core infrastructure technology like data storage, compute, and networking
  - A good understanding of the design principles and design areas of a mission-critical workload in the Azure Well-Architected Framework
  -	An Azure subscription 
  -	An Azure DevOps organization and project
