title: Continuously validate and test your mission-critical workloads
summary: A mission-critical workload needs to stay operational, even when failures occur. Before you deploy your workload to production, you want to evaluate the impact of changes, the system's ability to handle loads, and simulate failures. Learn how you can use Azure Load Testing and Azure Chaos Studio simultaneously as part of Azure Pipelines to achieve those goals.
