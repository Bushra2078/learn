To prevent performance bottlenecks and to increase confidence in new releases, Contoso Shoes has decided to implement [continuous validation](/azure/architecture/guide/testing/mission-critical-deployment-testing).

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll have demonstrated your ability to design and use continuous validation for a production-ready, mission-critical solution:

- You understand the importance of user and system flows as the foundation for defining load tests and chaos experiments for your workload.
- You established a baseline with expected thresholds for the system.  
- You defined requirements for load testing and chaos experiments.

Congratulations on completing this training module. You've learned how to design and use continuous validation and have applied this knowledge through the exercises to meet an organization's needs.
