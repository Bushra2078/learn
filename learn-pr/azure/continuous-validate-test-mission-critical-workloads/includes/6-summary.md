In this module, you've added continuous validation to prevent performance bottlenecks. You've learned to: 

- Identify relevant user and system flows.
- Define load tests for the flows to validate the expected performance and thresholds.
- Define baselines for normal scenarios and special scenarios that were simulated in chaos experiments.
- Integrate the continuous validation process into an automated pipeline.

Congratulations on completing this training module. You've learned how to design and use continuous validation and are now ready to meet an organization's needs. Apply the insights to increase the organization's confidence in deploying new releases reduce the issues from release rollouts and normal operations.
