  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "What is the goal of a chaos experiment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Break your production environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The goal is to inject failures into the deployment to test how the application behaves and responds to them. The result should be used to improve the error handling and monitoring to reduce the impact when these failures occur in production environments."
    - content: "Inject faults to test the workload and environment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The goal is to intentionally inject faults to test the deployment and its resiliency measures."
  - content: "Which services does Azure Chaos Studio support?"
    choices:
    - content: "All Azure services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Chaos Studio supports only a subset of Azure services."
    - content: "A subset of Azure services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Chaos Studio supports only a subset of Azure services today. New services and chaos experiments will be added over time."
    - content: "Only 3rd party services that are hosted outside of Azure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Chaos Studio supports a subset of Azure services."
  - content: "Before you can run an experiment against a service from Azure Chaos Studio, what settings do you need to enable?"
    choices:
    - content: "Targets and capabilities"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Before you can inject a fault against an Azure resource, the resource must first have corresponding targets and capabilities enabled."
    - content: "Availability zones"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Availability Zones are not a prerequisite to use Azure Chaos Studio."
    - content: "Azure Backup"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Backup is not a prerequisite to use Azure Chaos Studio."
