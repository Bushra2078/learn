  - content: "Is it the goal of a chaos experiment to break your production environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The goal is to inject failures into the deployment to test how the application behaves and responds to them. The result should be used to improve the error handling and monitoring to reduce the impact when these failures occur in production environments."
