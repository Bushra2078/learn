Enterprises usually use its private mobile networks to host various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Each IoT device uses a SIM or eSIM to identify itself to the network.

To effectively manage the SIMs for IoT devices, Azure Private 5G Core allows you to define SIM polices that'll be applied to the SIMs. SIM polices ensure that the network requirements of each IoT device are satisfied and the packet flows from each device are appropriately controlled.

Azure Private 5G Core also allows you to define services, which are sets of rules for network traffic handling. With separately defined services and SIM policies, you'll have the flexibility to reuse a service in one or more SIM policies.

After the deployment a private mobile network, you'll need to manage the SIMs for attached IoT devices on a routine basis. For example, you may need to provision a SIM for a newly attached device, or you may need to modify a SIM policy due to application requirement changes.

This unit introduces you to the SIM management tasks, like SIM provisioning, SIM policy configuration, or service configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> To be able to design and configure services and SIM policies, you need to be familiar with the network traffic at the packet level.
