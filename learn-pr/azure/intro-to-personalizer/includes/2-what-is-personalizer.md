The Azure Personalizer is a cloud-based service that is part of the Decision Services category, in Azure Cognitive Services. It allows your applications to select appropriate content to show users of the application. In the Introduction, it was noted that Personalizer can be used by your web application to select accessories or similar items to display to the shopper. 

Personalizer can offer a report to determine the effectiveness of the selection by monitoring the user's reaction (such as the selection of a recommended item), and generate a reward score. You can use this information to determine if the Personalizer recommendations are performing as you expect.

Given a context and featurized content, the Personalizer Service returns your content in a ranked list. As rewards are sent in response to the ranked list, the reinforcement learning algorithm will improve the model and improve performance of future rank calls.
