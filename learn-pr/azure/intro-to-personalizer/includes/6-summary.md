Azure Personalizer is a cloud-based service that helps your applications choose the best content item to show your users. Using a *closed-loop* learning model, the service learns the best option to display to the user based on the user's selections.

Personalizer uses features, which are information about the current context to choose the best action. The features represent all information you think may help personalize to achieve higher rewards. Features can be generic, or specific to an item.

Personalizer can be used when you want to select and display content to users for enhancing their experience with your services, achieve better business results through upsell opportunities or driving revenues through targeted advertisements on your site, or improving productivity by guiding employees through complex processes.
