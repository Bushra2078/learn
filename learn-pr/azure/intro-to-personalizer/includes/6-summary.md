Azure Personalizer is a cloud-based service that helps your applications choose the best content item to show your users. Personalizer uses a *closed-loop* learning model to display the best option based on a user's selections.

Personalizer uses features to choose the best action. The features represent all information in a user's current context that you think might help personalize your application or service to achieve higher rewards. Features can be generic or specific to an item.

Personalizer can be used when you want to: 
- Select and display content that enhances the user's experience with your services
- Achieve better business results through upsell opportunities or driving revenues through targeted advertisements on your site, or 
- Improve productivity by guiding employees through complex processes.
