Cloud computing is the provisioning of services and applications on demand over the internet. Servers, applications, data, and other resources are provided as a service. 

Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provides instant computing infrastructure that you can provision and managed over the Internet.

Platform as a service (PaaS) provides ready-made development and deployment environments that you can use to deliver your own cloud services.

Software as a service (or SaaS) delivers applications over the Internet as a web-based service.
