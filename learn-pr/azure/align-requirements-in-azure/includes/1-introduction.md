Cloud computing provides configurable computing resources and services that can be quickly provisioned with minimal management effort. Just like a public utility where you flip a switch or turn on a faucet, the resource is avaliable when you need it and you are only charged for the amount you use.

Depending on your scenario, you may need to consider a public, private, or hybrid cloud deployment.
