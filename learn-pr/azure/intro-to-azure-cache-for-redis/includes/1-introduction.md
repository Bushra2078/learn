Most enterprise apps use databases; these databases form the cornerstone of many modern apps. Consequently, it's important that they are as responsive as you can make them. Azure Cache for Redis can help you improve the performance and scalability of your apps. It does this by copying frequently accessed data and storing it in memory. 

As indicated in the following graphic, Azure Cache for Redis can help improve performance in apps that interface with many database solutions, including Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Database for MySQL.

## Example scenario

Let's imagine that you work for a company that makes athletic shoes. You sell these shoes via your website. You've recently undertaken analysis of website visits. You realise that there's been a reduction in the percentage of visits that translate into sales. Closer inspection of the data leads you to believe that performance issues are causing potential customers to leave your website before they can make a purchase. 

Management are looking to you to resolve this issue, and return to previous website sales levels. Azure Cache for Redis could help you solve this problem. Frequently accessed data can be cached in memory, avoiding the need to repeatedly retrieve the same information. 

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll evaluate how Azure Cache for Redis can improve the performance and scalability of your apps. You'll also describe how Redis provides a critical low-latency and high-throughput data storage solution to modern apps.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to evaluate whether Azure Cache for Redis can improve the performance and scalability of your apps.
