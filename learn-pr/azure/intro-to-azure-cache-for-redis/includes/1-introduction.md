Most enterprise apps use databases, which form the cornerstone of many modern apps. It's important to make your databases as responsive as possible. Azure Cache for Redis can help you improve the performance and scalability of your apps. It does this by copying frequently accessed data and storing it in memory.

As indicated in the following graphic, Azure Cache for Redis can help improve performance in apps that interface with many database solutions, including Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Database for MySQL.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a company that makes athletic shoes. You sell these shoes on your website and have recently started analyzing the website visits. You realize that there's been a reduction in the percentage of visits that translate into sales. Closer inspection of the data leads you to believe that performance issues are causing potential customers to leave your website before they can make a purchase.

Management has asked you to resolve this issue and return the website sales to previous levels. You can use Azure Cache for Redis to solve this problem. Azure Cache for Redis will cache the frequently-accessed data in memory, thereby avoiding the need to repeatedly retrieve the same information. This will result in improved website performance and sales.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll evaluate how Azure Cache for Redis can improve the performance and scalability of your apps. You'll also learn how Azure Cache for Redis provides a critical low-latency and high-throughput data storage solution to modern apps. You'll be able to evaluate how Azure Cache for Redis helps improve the performance and scalability of apps that rely heavily on back-end data stores.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to evaluate whether Azure Cache for Redis is the appropriate caching solution for your apps.
