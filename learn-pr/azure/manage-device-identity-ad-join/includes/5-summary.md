You work for a large book publisher that's deploying Windows 10 to employees' laptops. Your organization uses Azure Active Directory with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication enabled. Using these services, you can manage user identities and help protect the organization's resources. You want to add another layer of security for devices. Specifically, you want to restrict access to the organization's resources to only those devices managed by your organization and considered compliant by your mobile device management (MDM) system. You also want to improve your organization's experience when switching between devices.

In this module you've been introduced to device identities, and how they're used to bring better access control to your organizations resources. You have explored using the cloud-first, mobile-first Azure AD option and how it supports self-service and BOYD. You've also explored how to use enterprise state roaming to allow for separation of corporate data from consumer data and how it allows for settings to move with the user when they switch devices without having to go through a lengthy set-up process. You've seen how, with conditional access, you can control when and how a user will access your corporate resources.
