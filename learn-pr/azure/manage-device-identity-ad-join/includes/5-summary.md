In this module, you've been introduced to device identities, and how they bring better access control to an organization's resources. You've explored using Azure AD join, and how it supports self-service and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). 

 You've learned how, with Conditional Access, you can control when and how a user will access your corporate resources. You've also seen how to use Enterprise State Roaming to separate corporate data from consumer data. Enterprise State Roaming allows for settings to move with the user when they switch devices, without a lengthy set-up process.
