quiz:
  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Where should system components send their telemetry?"
    choices:
    - content: "A central data sink for logs and telemetry, which is common for global and regional resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although using a central storage for all telemetry makes it easier to analyze, it creates a single point of failure, which is unacceptable in mission-critical applications."
    - content: "A stamp-based data sink for logs and telemetry, where each stamp and global tier has its own sink."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using a dedicated data sink, shared on the global and stamp levels, is a good compromise for ease of access while eliminating a single point of failure."
    - content: "A decentralized data sink, where every Azure resource and every component has its own sink."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Splitting data sinks by resource is inefficient and creates unnecessary overhead for analysis."
  - content: "What language is used to query Log Analytics logs and calculate health scores?"
    choices:
    - content: "SQL (Structured Query Language)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SQL is commonly used in querying relational databases. Although the Log Analytics query format looks similar, it has a different syntax."
    - content: "T-SQL (Transact-SQL)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "T-SQL is an extension of the SQL language and is used to interact with relational databases."
    - content: "KQL (Kusto Query Language)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "KQL is used to query Log Analytic logs. It uses a hierarchy similar to SQL, but has a different syntax."
  - content: "What's the best dashboard technology for health modeling?"
    choices:
    - content: "There's no best technology; it depends on your needs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure offers multiple options when it comes to using dashboards, and each can be suitable for different purpose. The correct approach is to evaluate the visualization needs of the health model and choose appropriately."
    - content: "Azure Dashboards"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Dashboards is a suitable technology for using dashboards, but it might not fully support all necessary customizations."
    - content: "Azure Managed Grafana"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Grafana is powerful dashboard technology with rich customization options, but using it to build and manage the right visualization is more complex."
