title: 'Design a health model for your mission-critical workload'
summary: A mission-critical workload needs to be continuously monitored to ensure degraded application components are caught early to prevent a complete outage. A well-designed health model gives you that ability based on metrics and their thresholds that are important to you. Through optimized queries and visualization, you can identify the cascading impact of degraded components and troubleshoot issues early before they can cause an outage.
