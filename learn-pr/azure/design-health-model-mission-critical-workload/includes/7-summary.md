Contoso Shoes is an online shoe store that wants to add health modeling to their internal website and develop queries and dashboards for better observability. Contoso Shoes migrated their on-premises deployments to the cloud two years ago to improve operations and have successfully applied the principles of mission-critical architecture so that their main customer-facing application is now mission critical.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll have demonstrated your ability to design a health modeling system in a production-ready, mission-critical solution.

In this module, you created the foundation of a health model for the defined architecture:

- You identified two user flows: list catalog items and add comment.
- You identified key application components and metrics.
- You visualized the health model in a dashboard.

Congratulations on completing this training module. You've learned how to design a health model and have applied this knowledge through the exercises to meet an organization's needs.
