To design a health model for their workload, the Contoso Shoes organization needs to become familiar with application architecture and understand the key Azure services involved.

This unit describes two end-user flows in the application:

- List catalog items
- Add comment

Both user flows are dependent on the Catalog API. The add comment user flow depends also on the background processor.

The final layer of the health model includes the following Azure resources: App Service, Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Event Hubs.
