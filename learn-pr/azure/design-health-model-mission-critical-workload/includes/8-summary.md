After Contoso Shoes successfully applied the principles of mission-critical architecture in their main customer-facing application, the organization identified a gap in awareness of the health and availability of their internal web application. A mission-critical workload needs to be continuously monitored to ensure degraded application components are caught early to prevent a complete outage. A well-designed health model gives you that ability based on metrics and their thresholds. Therefore, the organization wants to design a health model for this workload and develop queries and dashboards for better observability.

In this module, you identified user flows and key application components of a given architecture, identified key metrics for the foundation of the health model for this architecture, and visualized the health model in a dashboard.
