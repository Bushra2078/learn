quiz:
  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "What is the main motivation to use health models instead of traditional dashboards?"
    choices:
    - content: "Health models provide contextual information to raw metrics data and allow you to react faster to problems."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Health modeling focuses on a holistic view of the application, so you don't need to focus on raw data."
    - content: "Health models look better and allow operators to focus on the important parts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While the visual aspect of a health model is important, the same also applies to traditional dashboards. The added value of a health model is in clearly displaying an indication of the overall health of the system."
  - content: "Health modeling focuses on:"
    choices:
    - content: "Cloud resources and health metrics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although resources and metrics provide the necessary foundation of the health model, they aren't enough on their own."
    - content: "A holistic view of the application, including, but not limited to, cloud resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Health modeling focuses on the overall health status of the application, rather than raw data metrics. "
  - content: "What does it mean when an application health model is described as 'layered?'"
    choices:
    - content: "The health model is multi-dimensional, the whole system is broken down into layers, and the operator filters for only the layer relevant to them."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Filtering on a single layer isn't the purpose of a health model, which provides value when analyzed and observed as a whole."
    - content: "A layered health model enables application health to be traced back to the health of its lower level dependencies, which helps to quickly find the root cause of service degradation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Each layer of the health model captures what its healthy and unhealthy states represent."
