  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Of these three items, which one is at the highest level in the health model hierarchy?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure resources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure resources are at the lowest level in the health model hierarchy."
    - content: "User flows"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "User flows, such as 'list catalog items' and 'add comment', are at the highest level of the health model hierarchy, just below the whole website."
    - content: "Application components"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Application components, such as the background processor, are located at a middle level in the health model hierarchy."
  - content: "When selecting metrics and thresholds, you need to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Base your decision on your experience with what a normal operation looks like for the system. Observe and refine the values over time."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Although you should make the best decision you can with the information at hand, you can easily change the health model later if you need to."
    - content: "Be careful and choose correctly, because these decisions are difficult to change later in the health model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can easily change the health model later if you need to."
  - content: "Does it make sense to have both “degraded” and “unhealthy” states in your health model?"
    choices:
    - content: "No. When a component isn't working properly, the whole application should go to the unhealthy state and wait for the problem to be addressed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When a component isn't working properly, it doesn't always mean that the business requirements are impacted. For example, although a slower response time means that the user will still get a response, it needs to be investigated before it causes a complete outage."
    - content: "Yes. Not all parts of the system have the same criticality, and sometimes suboptimal performance doesn’t break the application for end users."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Not all parts of the system are equally critical. Sometimes, suboptimal performance of certain parts is acceptable and doesn't break the application for end users."
