  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Of these three items, which is at the highest level in the health model hierarchy?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure resources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure resources are at the lowest level in the health model hierarchy."
    - content: "User flows"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "User flows, such as *List catalog items* and *Add comment*, are at the highest level of the health model hierarchy, just below the entire website."
    - content: "Application components"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Application components, such as the background processor, are located at a middle level in the health model hierarchy."
  - content: "When you select metrics and thresholds, you need to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Base your decision on your experience with what a normal operation looks like for the system. Observe and refine the values over time."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Although you should make the best decision you can with the information at hand, you can easily change the health model later if you need to."
    - content: "Be careful and choose correctly, because these decisions are difficult to change later in the health model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can easily change the health model later if you need to."
  - content: "Does it make sense to have both *degraded* and *unhealthy* states in your health model?"
    choices:
    - content: "No. When a component isn't working properly, the entire application should enter the *unhealthy* state and wait for the problem to be addressed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When a component isn't working properly, it doesn't always mean that the business requirements are affected. For example, although a slower response time means that the user will still get a response, it needs to be investigated before it causes a complete outage."
    - content: "Yes. Not all parts of the system have the same criticality. Sometimes, suboptimal performance doesn't break the application for its users."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Not all non-healthy states will break the application for its users. It's important to distinguish issues that will impact users from those that can potentially lead to outages."
