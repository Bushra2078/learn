      If a Fitbit smart watch sends heart-rate readings to the cloud every 15 minutes for Anomaly Detector to detect irregular heartbeats.  What will be the correct JSON parameters for the univariate Anomaly Detector API?
    choices:
    - content: "Set Granularity to 15-minutes, and set the Series to be a collect of both the timestamp and heart-rate value from each reading."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The possible values for Granularity are 'minutely, 'hourly', 'daily', 'monthly' or 'yearly'."
    - content: "Only set Granularity to minutely, and set the Series to be a collect of both the timestamp and heart-rate value from each reading."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The CustomInterval needs to be set as well."
    - content: "Set Granularity to minutely, CustomInterval to 15, and set the Series to be a collection of both the timestamp and heart-rate value from each reading."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A Granularity set to 'minutely' indicates that the unit of frequency occurs in minutes. In addition, the CustomInterval is needed to specify the number of minutes. Finally, the Series parameter sets the collect of both the timestamp and heart-rate value from each reading."
