In this module, you learned how to detect anomalies in real-time from an IoT time-series data stream using Azure Anomaly Detector APIs. You also learned how to train an AI model using the multivariate API to identify outliers, unexpected data patterns or data that deviate significantly from the norm.

You were able to use Azure IoT Hub, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Anomaly Detector APIs to build a solution to help an electricity company to be alerted quickly when an anomaly is identified from a household's smart meter reading. In addition, the solution helped the company to be able to drill down to what factors are causing the high energy consumption.  Finally, you were able to send remote device data to the cloud; process the data and detect anomalies.

With the skills you've learned, you should be able to:
- Understand what is anomaly detection
- Understand how the Azure Anomaly Detector APIs work and when to use for your scenario
- Build a solution to use a prebuilt Azure Anomaly Detector model on real-time IoT data streams
- Train and evaluate your own model with Azure Anomaly Detector using your unique time-series data
- Pinpoint key contributors of an anomaly when you've more than one variable in your data

When running and managing business applications, it's critical to monitor your system to prevent problems before they occur.  In addition, you need to be able to detect anomalies and root causes. This helps prevent system downtime and cost. Whether you're dealing with one metric or multiple metrics, you should be able to determine which Azure Anomaly Detector model is best suited for your scenario.

We used a remote device as our data source. However, given what you have learned, you should be able to apply the same problem-solving approach to other data sources.  Finally, try using docker containers to enable you to use the Anomaly Detector API to install and deploy to edge devices.
