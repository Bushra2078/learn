Now that you have built the base terrain for your wind farm experience, build the project and deploy it to the HoloLens 2.  After you have deployed and tested, return to build out more functionality into your Mixed Reality experience.

[Building your application to your HoloLens 2 -  Mixed Reality](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/tutorials/mr-learning-base-02?tabs=winxr#building-your-application-to-your-hololens-2)

When adjusting your build settings, be sure to **Add Open Scenes** if your Scene does not appear in the **Scenes in Build**.  Then be sure to select the Scene of interest before adjusting settings.  Select Universal Windows Platform as the target Platform.

Once your app has been deployed, you can put on your HoloLens 2 and begin testing the experience.  The Start menu on HoloLens is where you'll open apps, see important status info, and access tools like the camera.  To open your app from the Start menu, simply select an app tile. You can also say the name of the app to open it.  Navigate the experience and test the functionality you developed.

## Place Terrain

1. When the app first opens, the map will be floating in front you in the direction faced when launching the app. 
2. Grab the base of the map directly with your hands (near interaction) or by using the hand ray pointer (far interaction). The base of the map will turn a light blue when hovered. Grab and position the map on top of a suitable real world surface. The hologram will remain anchored at this position allowing you to move around and observe it from any angle.

To exit an app that uses an immersive view, use the **Start gesture** to bring up the **Start menu**, then select the Mixed reality Home button. Once you have exited the app, close the app window using the close icon in the top right of the window.

After you are done testing your wind farm experience, uninstall the app:

- Uninstall from the Start menu
1.	On the **Start** menu or in the **All apps** list, browse to the app. Select and hold until the menu appears, then select **Uninstall**.

- Uninstall from Settings
1.	On the **Start** menu, select **Settings -> Apps**. Find the app from the list, select it and then click **Uninstall**.
