Unity is a robust 3D development engine with many features, and as a result, it has a large number of Editor windows. To help make the work environment more approachable, the Default Layout features only major windows used during typical development. Additional Windows can be found under the Windows menu item at the top of the work area.

The main Editor workspaces are as follows:

A. **Toolbar:** Provides a shortcut to the most essential features. These include tools for manipulating the scene view, GameObjects, and play controls.
B. **Scene view:** Main Work Area. Allows you to visually navigate and edit your Scene.
C. **Game view:** Simulates what your final rendered game will look. When you click the Play button, the simulation begins.
D. **Hierarchy Window:** Lists all GameObjects that exist in the current Scene.
E. **Inspector window:** Lists the Properties of a selected GameObject or asset.
F. **Project window:** Lists all the assets, scenes, and scripts contained in your created project.
