The HoloLens 2 is Microsoft's flagship Mixed Reality device for hosting unique and immersive experiences that connect users to data, processes, and actions. For this learning path, you'll be working on a simulated industry scenario for a windmill farm by pulling in real-time turbine data using the Azure Digital Twins service. The end goal is to give you a foundation in practical ways of visualizing and experiencing data in a 3D augmented reality environment.

In this module, you'll be introduced to the basics of Mixed Reality, Azure Digital Twins, and the Unity engine.  You'll also be guided through getting started with Azure subscriptions and accounts, and how to set up a Unity project and development environment.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to define Mixed Reality, create an Azure Digital Twins account, and set up a Unity project. You'll also have context on applying the learnings from this module to a real-world industry use case and on the role Azure SignalR services play in getting real-time web functionality.
