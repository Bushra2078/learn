Azure Digital Twins is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that enables you to create a digital representation of real-world things, places, business processes, and people. Gain insights that help you drive better products, optimize operations and costs, and create breakthrough customer experiences.

Azure Digital Twins enables the creation of knowledge graphs based on digital models of entire environments. These environments could be buildings, factories, farms, energy networks, railways, stadiums, and moreâ€”even entire cities. These digital models can be used to gain insights that drive better products, optimize operations, reduce costs, and breakthrough customer experiences.

## Create an Azure Digital Twins account

To create and use Azure services (including Azure Digital Twin), you need an Azure subscription. For more information on how to create an Azure account, see the [Create an Azure account](/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/) learning module.

An Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) has been created for you to set up your Azure Digital Twin development and operating environment.  This ARM template contains all the required instructions to automatically build out your Azure service environment (for example, storage, applications, SignalR, and so on).

## Unity overview

Originally known for its capabilities as a game engine, Unity is widely known as a cross-platform, real-time 3D platform used by game developers and industry professionals alike.  Unity will be the core development platform in this learning path that you will use to create immersive Mixed Reality experiences.  You will use the Unity platform (Personal, Plus, Pro, or Enterprise versions) to build a 3D scene, import prebuilt assets / game objects known as Prefabs, connect the Unity Scene to Azure Digital Twin services that stream operational data, and then build a User Experience and deploy it to the HoloLens or VR to operate your Digital Twin.
