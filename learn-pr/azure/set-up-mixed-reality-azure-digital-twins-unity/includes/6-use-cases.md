Throughout the “Build Mixed Reality Digital Twins with Azure Digital Twin and Unity” learning path, you'll work with fictional assets and simulated operational data based on a wind farm. The telemetry data, although realistic, isn't real and isn't representative of actual wind farm performance – it's been simulated for educational purposes. Your HoloLens 2 application will be focused on operating a fictional wind farm, using Microsoft and Unity technologies to create a functioning Digital Twin.

In this learning path, you'll create an application for the HoloLens 2 to receive data from an Azure Digital Twin (ADT) instance of a wind turbine, complete with operational sensor data.  You'll illustrate the value of connecting sensor data to your wind turbine Digital Twin in an immersive, data-rich experience.  The HoloLens 2 experience will enable you to visualize, monitor, and act on operation conditions on a wind power generating facility.  Specifically, you'll use Azure services to monitor the operational state of a set of wind turbines, observing power, ambient temperature, and simulated events.
