Our goal in this module was to move an ASP.NET web application from our company's hosting environment to Azure App Services.

Using a simulated environment, you used the Azure App Service Migration Assistant to first perform an assessment of our application to check for dependencies on lower-level services available from Windows Server and Internet Information Services. The Azure App Service Migration Assistant determined that there was nothing preventing you from migrating the application  to Azure App Service, so you supplied the Migration Assistant with details like the target Resource Group, the URL, and so on and it performed the migration for you.

Without the Azure App Service Migration Assistant, you may have needed to manually review the web application's source code and compare against a list of known issues that might prevent a legacy ASP.NET web application from being deployed to Azure App Services.  This entire process could take days or weeks, depending on your familiarity with the code base, Windows Server, Internet Information Services, and more.

The Azure App Service Migration Wizard provides dramatic business impact, speeding your efforts in moving to the cloud.
