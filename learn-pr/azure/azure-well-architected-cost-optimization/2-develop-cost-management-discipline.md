Cost optimization is conducted at various levels of the organization. It's important to understand how your workload is aligned with organizational goals and FinOps practices. A view into the business units, resource organization, and centralized audit policies allows you to apply a standardized financial system and approach to your workload.

## Develop a cost model

Contoso is considering building a mobile ticketing platform for the trade shows they run. They don't have any idea on the total cost of ownership for delivering an experience like this, especially as a ticketing system usually deals with burst demand. They know they want to start small and grow over time, but they don't know how to model this to predict the cost of building and maintaining a workload like this, incrementally. Without these initial estimates, it will be hard to get initial funding for the project and predict long term funding needs.

> **Approach**: Develop a cost model. This fundamental exercise is a prerequisite to setting up a financial tracking system.
>
> A cost model helps segment expenses and estimate and forecast the total cost of ownership, including infrastructure, support, and implementation. It enables you to identify cost drivers early and predict how usage growth or shrinkage will affect overall revenue and spending in your projected business model for the workload.

The workload team spends some time to model estimated costs in various scenarios. They input large cost drivers such as rough estimated infrastructure costs, team expenditures, and revenue from the offering. This model then allows them to start predicting cost, and understand how costs will increase as usage increases over time. They know they can refine the model as architectural and operational decisions are decided to increase its predictive power.

## Estimate realistic budgets

Contoso needs to allocate funding to the mobile ticketing workload. The workload can't be allowed to run with a blank check. Likewise, having a pre-allocation shortfall could put the workload timeline and success in jeopardy. And over-allocating can lead to unnecessary up front expenditures that don't map to the short term needs of the workload.

> **Approach**: Estimate realistic budgets that cover all non-negotiable functional and nonfunctional requirements, personnel and training costs, and processes that provide for anticipated growth.
>
> You'll be able to set financial boundaries and establish ways to check your spending against the allocated budget. You'll also get notifications when certain thresholds are exceeded, which prevents overspending at the tenant scope, resource scope, and other scopes that are applied to the budget.

With a budget in place, based off of the initial cost modeling exercise and other known factors, the workload architect can start designing against financial constraints. As more is learned about the implementation and the operations necessary, to workload teams expects to need to renegotiate a bit. They want a small buffer, but ultimately will be driving toward fiscal responsibility by adhering to the budget allocation.

## Encourage upstream communication

Contoso's mobile ticketing workload has been successful. The team members however notice that the implementation isn't really as optimized as it could be. Since project management and finance seems pleased with the workload's success so far, they don't know if they should say anything.

> **Approach**: Encourage upstream communication from architects to application owners.
>
> Costs are reduced when you act on feedback, which should be considered as meaningful as numeric data. You'll empower employees by using their input to drive realistic design changes and business strategies.

The workload team was encouraged to "spend it like it's theirs" and as such are free to speak up to product management when they see alternative approaches during design or implementation to address the functional requirements of the application, but in a more cost efficient way.
