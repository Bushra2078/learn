quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which of these is one of the factors that you should take into account when measuring your workload's total cost?"
      choices:
        - content: "The cost of marketing for the product launch"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Marketing is not directly related to the workload's total cost."
        - content: "The budget forecast for the workload"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The budget forecast is based on the cost model and is not factored into the workload's total cost."
        - content: "The development team's salaries"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Salaries are not directly related to the workload's total cost."
        - content: "The impact on ROI"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The impact on ROI is one of the factors that you should take into account when measuring your workload's total cost."

    - content: "When fine-tuning the workload design, which of these should you prioritize?"
      choices:
        - content: "Achieving the highest possible resilience"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Resilience is important, but achieving the highest possible resilience shouldn't be the priority for cost-efficiency."
        - content: "Achieving the highest possible performance"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Performance is important, but achieving the highest possible performance shouldn't be the priority for cost-efficiency."
        - content: "Using services that are in private or public preview"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Services that are in private or public preview are not yet ready for production workloads."
        - content: "Using services that can reduce the overall cost of the workload"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Focusing on using services that can reduce the overall cost of the workload is a great way to achieve cost-efficiency."

    - content: "If the workload team wants to ensure that the workload's Azure cost is kept under control, which of these should they do?"
      choices:
        - content: "Deploy enough infrastructure to cover the workload's peak demand, with some buffer"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This type of deployment is not cost-efficient as it results in over-provisioning."
        - content: "Empower the operations team to shut down virtual machines that are not heavily used"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This could result in the workload's performance and users being affected. Virtual machines should only be shut down through automation."
        - content: "Enforce the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although MFA is a good security practice, it is not directly related to the workload's cost."
        - content: "Use Azure Policy to enforce the use of cost-efficient SKUs"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "By using Azure Policy to enforce the use of cost-efficient SKUs, the workload team can ensure that higher-priced SKUs are not deployed without approval."
