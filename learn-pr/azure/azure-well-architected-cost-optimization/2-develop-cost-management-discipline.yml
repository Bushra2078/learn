  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What modeling technique is used to predict total cost of ownership (TCO) in a workload?"
      choices:
        - content: "A health model"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A health model is a technique represent system health, not cost."
        - content: "A revenue model"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Total cost of ownership factors in more than just revenue."
        - content: "A cost model"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "That's correct. A cost model forecasts the total cost of ownership, including infrastructure, support, and implementation."
        - content: "A budget"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A budget is an financial allocation, not a modeling process."

    - content: "What sets the financial limits for a workload?"
      choices:
        - content: "A cost model"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A cost model helps in forecasting, but does not inform financial governance."
        - content: "Training"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While financial training is beneficial, it isn't used to set workload team constraints."
        - content: "Cost monitoring"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Cost monitoring can be used to see if a workload is nearing or exceeding financial targets, but isn't used to set them."
        - content: "A realistic budget"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "That's correct. A budget is the ultimate financial boundary that drives design and implementation decisions."

    - content: "If the mobile ticketing workload team wanted to predict how doubling its user base would impact the total cost of ownership, what should they do?"
      choices:
        - content: "Ask for more budget"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "No additional budget should be requested for hypothetical growth."
        - content: "Run the variation through the workload's cost model"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "That's correct. The workload's cost model should include a usage factor to help predict the change in TCO."
        - content: "Assume it's x2 their current spend"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Costs are rarely linear in cloud architectures, so this assumption isn't warranted."
        - content: "Do nothing, the workload should scale automatically"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The workload infrastructure handling more usage is not the same as holistic financial planning associated with workload growth."
