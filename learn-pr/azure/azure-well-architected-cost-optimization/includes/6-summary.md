In this module we've looked at some of the key principles of the Cost Optimization pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework. This starts with proper planning and estimation of costs. When provisioning resources, make them as cost-optimized as possible from the start to keep your costs low. For deployed resources, leverage tools and services such as Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor to keep your ongoing costs in check. Lastly, ensure you take advantage of existing licenses, instance reservations, and different service tiers to continue to maximize the efficiency of your applications and architecture.
