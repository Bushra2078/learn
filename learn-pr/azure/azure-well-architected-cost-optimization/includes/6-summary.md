In this module, you've looked at some of the key principles of the cost optimization pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework. 

Optimizing your applications begins with proper planning and estimation of costs. When you're provisioning resources, make them as cost-optimized as possible from the start to keep your costs low. For deployed resources, use tools and services such as Microsoft Cost Management and Azure Advisor to keep your ongoing costs in check. Take advantage of existing licenses, instance reservations, and service tiers to continue to maximize the efficiency of your applications and architecture.
