A cloud operating model enables your organization to have a structured set of tools and processes to deliver successful and cost effective solutions on Azure. It helps you 

## Plan

Establishing clear business outcomes, a clearly defined digital estate plan, and well-understood adoption backlogs.

Capture requirements
Define workloads
Research subscription models
Identify resources
Understand Azure billing
Identify stakeholders
Estimate the initial cost

Comprehensive, up-front planning allows you to tailor cloud usage to your specific business requirements. Before creating any new resources, ask yourself:

- What business problem am I solving?
- What usage patterns do I expect from my resources?

Your answers will help you select the offerings that are right for you. They determine the infrastructure to use and how it's used to maximize your Azure efficiency.

## Ready

Ensure the readiness of staff through skills and learning plans.

## Operate

Define a manageable operating model to guide activities during and long after adoption.

### Organize

Align people and teams to deliver proper cloud operations and adoption

Create control policies
Create groups and roles to check cost

Putting some organization to your resources can help track where some of your costs are going. There are ways to group resources together, establishing a relationship so you know where your costs are related. From a billing perspective, resources can be easily grouped by:

- Assigning resources to different subscriptions.
- Assigning resources to different resource groups.
- Applying tags to resources.

Using subscriptions and resource groups to organize resources is an easy way to logically group resources and can be leveraged when going through billing data. Tags come into play when resource relationships span the boundaries of subscriptions and resource groups. Tags are key/value pairs that can be added to any resource, and are exposed in billing data, allowing you to associate a department or cost center with your resource. Tags improve your ability to report on cost, as well as giving each department in your organization accountability for their own costs. The following illustration shows how you can apply the same tag to resources in different resource groups and even in different subscriptions.

Adding some organization to your resources can go a long way and can really aid in your ability to understand where your costs are going. Now let's take a look at some ways to optimize costs.

### Govern

### Manage

### Support

<!-- ## Measure

When structured well, Cost Management helps you to inform people about the Azure costs they're responsible for or for the money they spend. Azure Cost Management has a tool called Cost Analysis, which you will learn to use in this lesson. It's designed to give you insight into where your money is spent. Take advantage of this tool. It can help you find identify key cost drivers and trends within your environments.

Attribute costs in your organization to make sure that people responsible are accountable for their team's spending. To fully understand your organization's Azure spending, you should organize your resources to maximize insight into cost attribution. Good organization helps to manage and reduce costs and hold people accountable for efficient spending in your organization. Once properly organized, you can begin creating budgets in Cost Management to track and alert on your spending. In this lesson, you will learn how to use our budgets tool to make sure that your teams are held responsible for the costs that they accrue.


## Iterate
Identify areas of additional investment

Act to reduce your spending. Make the most of it based on the findings gathered through planning and increasing cost visibility. You might consider purchase and licensing optimizations or infrastructure deployment changes based on your findings in the Cost Analysis tool.

Everyone in your organization must engage in the cost management lifecycle. They need to stay involved on an ongoing basis to optimize costs. Be rigorous about this iterative process and make it a key tenet of responsible cloud governance in your organization. -->
