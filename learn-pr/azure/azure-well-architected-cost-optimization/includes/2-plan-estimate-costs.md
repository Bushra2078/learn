Whether your organization is planning to build a new application on Azure or you're looking to move an entire data center to the cloud, estimating costs is a key piece of ensuring a successful project. How do you know which services to select, or which size to choose? Do you provision virtual machines for your workload, or do you take advantage of higher-level servcies that can reduce operational costs? Proper planning is incredibly important to any cloud project, let's take a look at what to consider.

## Capture requirements

Before beginning any cloud project, it's important to take time to properly plan, and that's especially important when considering costs. The cloud introduces a shift from purchasing static equipment like servers and switches, to a dynamic model where you purchase the usage of services. 

Identify the stakeholders for the project. This should include the business teams that are driving the organizational outcomes. It should also include the technical teams involved in the project. Bring everyone to the same table and foster a culture of transparency. All teams involved in the project should have visibility into the decisions that are made that impact cost.

Capture the requirements of the application. Include both the business requirements and the technical requirements of the application, as both can directly impact cost. Business requirements may be an API interface to enable partner communications or a reporting interface for the accounting department to view financial transactions. Technical requirements could be the ability to store relational data or the ability for users to use a personal identity to access applications. All of these requirements would have impact on the overall cost of the application, and will influence the selection of services that are used to meet these requirements.

Once you have the requirements identified, you'll want to define the workloads that are in scope to use cloud services and identify the services and resources you'll use. This will include evaluating and comparing service options to select the best service to meet your requirements. Once identified, you can then begin to estimate costs for your application.

## Estimate costs

With your list of services captured, you can use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?azure-portal=true) to create estimates of the cost of your application. The pricing calculator allows you to create, save, and share estimates of all Azure services.

As part of your cost estimation, it's also important to understand the different subscription and billing models available on Azure. Two of the most common models are *pay-as-you-go* and *enterprise agreement*.

- Pay-as-you-go subscriptions give you flexibility to purchase and use the services you need with the flexibility of no upfront commitments.
- Enterprise agreements 

No architecture is static, so you'll want to include in your estimates any future investements that you may be planning to make. This will give you longer term visibility into the costs for your applicaiton, and how those may shift over time. Often times the additional investment can reduce costs, such as moving from virtual machines to app services, reducing operational costs.

Comprehensive, up-front planning allows you to tailor cloud usage to your specific business requirements. Before creating any new resources, ask yourself:

- What business problem am I solving?
- What usage patterns do I expect from my resources?

Your answers will help you select the offerings that are right for you. They determine the infrastructure to use and how it's used to maximize your Azure efficiency.

## Ready

Ensure the readiness of staff through skills and learning plans.

## Operate

Define a manageable operating model to guide activities during and long after adoption.

### Organize

Align people and teams to deliver proper cloud operations and adoption

Create control policies
Create groups and roles to check cost

Putting some organization to your resources can help track where some of your costs are going. There are ways to group resources together, establishing a relationship so you know where your costs are related. From a billing perspective, resources can be easily grouped by:

- Assigning resources to different subscriptions.
- Assigning resources to different resource groups.
- Applying tags to resources.

Using subscriptions and resource groups to organize resources is an easy way to logically group resources and can be leveraged when going through billing data. Tags come into play when resource relationships span the boundaries of subscriptions and resource groups. Tags are key/value pairs that can be added to any resource, and are exposed in billing data, allowing you to associate a department or cost center with your resource. Tags improve your ability to report on cost, as well as giving each department in your organization accountability for their own costs. The following illustration shows how you can apply the same tag to resources in different resource groups and even in different subscriptions.

Adding some organization to your resources can go a long way and can really aid in your ability to understand where your costs are going. Now let's take a look at some ways to optimize costs.

### Govern

### Manage

### Support -->

<!-- ## Measure

When structured well, Cost Management helps you to inform people about the Azure costs they're responsible for or for the money they spend. Azure Cost Management has a tool called Cost Analysis, which you will learn to use in this lesson. It's designed to give you insight into where your money is spent. Take advantage of this tool. It can help you find identify key cost drivers and trends within your environments.

Attribute costs in your organization to make sure that people responsible are accountable for their team's spending. To fully understand your organization's Azure spending, you should organize your resources to maximize insight into cost attribution. Good organization helps to manage and reduce costs and hold people accountable for efficient spending in your organization. Once properly organized, you can begin creating budgets in Cost Management to track and alert on your spending. In this lesson, you will learn how to use our budgets tool to make sure that your teams are held responsible for the costs that they accrue.


## Iterate
Identify areas of additional investment

Act to reduce your spending. Make the most of it based on the findings gathered through planning and increasing cost visibility. You might consider purchase and licensing optimizations or infrastructure deployment changes based on your findings in the Cost Analysis tool.

Everyone in your organization must engage in the cost management lifecycle. They need to stay involved on an ongoing basis to optimize costs. Be rigorous about this iterative process and make it a key tenet of responsible cloud governance in your organization. -->
