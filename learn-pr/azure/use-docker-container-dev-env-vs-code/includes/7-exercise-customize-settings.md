The `devcontainer.json` helps you configure a variety of settings in your containerized Visual Studio Code setup. So far, you've configured a dev container for a Python project. However, there are still some rough edges and setup tasks that you can further automate. In this exercise, you'll use the `devcontainer.json` file to smooth these edges and make the project work with no setup steps from the developer.

## Reopen project locally

Before you make tweaks to the container configuration, you need to reopen the project locally.

1. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to open the Command Palette.
1. Type "locally" and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen Locally."
1. Open the `devcontainer.json` file in the ".devcontainer" folder if it is not open already.

## Install Visual Studio Code extensions

The container comes with the Microsoft Python extension. They Python extension enables snippets, linting, and intellisense in Python files. But the "index.html" file in the "templates" folder is a Jinja template, and a different extension needs to be installed to get syntax highlighting in that file.

1.  Open the Command Palette.
1.  Type "extension" and select "Extensions: Install Extensions."
1.  In the extension explorer on the right, search for "jinja."
1.  Right-click the "Jinja" extension from "wholroyd" and select "Add to devcontainer.json."
1.  Notice that the extension ID has been added to the "extensions" option.

    ```json
    // Add the IDs of extensions you want installed when the container is created.
    "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "wholroyd.jinja"
    ],
    ```

## Forward port 5000

Visual Studio Code automatically detects and forwards port 5000. It's a good practice to make the port forwarding an explicit part of the project configuration. Doing so will ensure that the port gets forwarded instead of relying on the editor.

1.  Open the `devcontainer.json` file in the ".devcontainer" folder.
1.  Uncomment out the "forwardPorts" option, and add 5000 to the array.

```json
// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally
"forwardPorts": [5000],
```

## Automate dependency installation

Right now, a developer setting up the project for the first time has to know to run "pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt" to install dependencies. Without these dependencies, the project won't run, and other developers might not know why.

Uncomment out the "postCreateCommand" option.

```json
"postCreateCommand": "pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt"
```

## Rebuild the new container

1. Open the Command Palette.
1. Type "rebuild" and select "Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container."

The container will be rebuilt with the changes you've specified in the "devcontainer.json" file.

## Examine the forwarded port

1. Open the Command Palette.
1. Type "remote explorer" and select "View: Show Remote Explorer."
1. Notice that port 5000 is already forwarded, even though you haven't started the app yet.

## Examine syntax highlighting provided by Jinja extension

1. Open the "template/index.html" file.
1. Scroll down to line 33 and notice that there's syntax highlighting on the "for" loop.
   :::image type="content" source="../media/for-loop.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of Jinja template, emphasizing a for loop with syntax highlighting.":::

## Run the app

1.  Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> to open the Visual Studio Code integrated terminal.
1.  Run the app with the following command:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

1.  Notice that you didn't have to install any dependencies. The application simply runs.

The container is now customized and automated for your agency. Any developer who opens this project with Remote - Containers can immediately run it and get to work writing code.

In the next section, you'll learn how to install software in the dev container.
