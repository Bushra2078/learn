  title: "Access Azure Storage Metrics in Code"
  questions:
  - content: "You have created a service principal in Azure Active Directory and used the successfully authenticated with the LoginSilentAsync method. When you call MetricDefinitions.ListAsync, you receive an access denied message. How should you resolve this problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call the Metrics.ListAsync method instead of the MetricDefinitions.ListAsync method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If you have been denied access to metric definitions, you will also be denied access to metric value. Instead, you must assign the service principal to a role in Azure with permissions to access Azure Monitor."
    - content: "Assign the service principal to an appropriate role in Azure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Since you can authenticate without errors but cannot access resources, you must have created all the requirements for the service principal correctly but not assigned the service principal to a role in Azure with permissions to access Azure Monitor."
    - content: "Create an access key for the service principal in Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Since you can authenticate without errors but cannot access resources, you must have created all the requirements for the service principal correctly including the access key. Instead, assign the service principal to a role in Azure with permissions to access Azure Monitor."
  - content: "You have written code that successfully obtains metric definitions for an Azure Storage account from Azure Monitor. Now you want to obtain values of the UsedCapacity metric. Which method should you call?"
    choices:
    - content: "MetricDefinitions.ListAsync"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This method gets a list of definitions. To get a list of values for a metric, call Metrics.ListAsync."
    - content: "Metrics.ListAsync"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Once you have obtained a list of the definitions that are available by using MetricDefinitions.ListAsync, you can call Metrics.ListAsync to obtain the values of a specific metric."
    - content: "The monitor client constructor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You call the monitor client constructor to authenticate with Azure. To find the values of a specfic metric, use Metrics.ListAsync."
