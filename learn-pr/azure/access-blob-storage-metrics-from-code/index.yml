  title: Access metrics from your Azure Blob Storage Containers programmatically
  description: In order to provide a reliable service, you should make sure that all your business-critical systems are carefully monitored. For services in Azure, the Azure Monitor provides a unified tool that gathers, stores and displays performance metrics. If you use an Azure Storage account to store blobs, metrics will be added to Azure Monitor to record that accountâ€™s behavior. In this module, you will learn how to configure and access those metrics from .NET application code, such as from mobile device apps or web apps.
