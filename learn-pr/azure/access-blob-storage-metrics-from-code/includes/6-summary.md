In this module, you learned about two APIs that you can use to access the metrics that Azure Storage accounts send Azure Monitor when you use Blob storage.

The Azure Storage REST API is a web service that you can access through HTTP requests through port 80. In unit 3, you used the **curl** tool to send such requests from the Cloud Shell and view the results.

In unit 5, you used the Azure Storage .NET API to make a similar request. You can use this API to interact with Azure Monitor and access Storage metrics for display in mobile apps, web applications, and many other types of custom project.
