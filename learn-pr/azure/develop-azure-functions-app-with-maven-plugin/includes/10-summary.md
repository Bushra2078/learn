Your company uses Java as its primary development language. Your company is researching how to create serverless functions in Azure to simplify event reporting. You're tasked with creating a cloud-based function that triggers when specific values are passed in the HTTP request and outputs a log entry to track the activity.

In this module, you learnt how to create an archetype function project using Maven through the Azure CLI. You learnt how to develop and test this function locally before deploying it to Azure.  You learned different methods for testing the Azure Function application using a web browser. Finally, you learnt how to add system and Application Insight tracking to your application to improve the quality of the monitoring for your application.

Using Maven and your existing development tools, you've deployed your locally developed application into Azure, without needing to learn how to use Azure.  Using Azure Application Insights will benefit your Azure DevOps teams as they build applications, since the monitoring can provide crucial insights into the behavior of the application.  After deployment, Application Insights can provide fine grained details on application usage.

Without using the Maven Azure functions plug in, you would be looking at lengthy and time consuming training for your development staff, and tackling a migration of your development processes to develop your applications directly in Azure.
