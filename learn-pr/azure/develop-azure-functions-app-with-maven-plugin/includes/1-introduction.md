Use the Maven Plugin for Azure Functions to create an Azure Function, and deploy the function to Azure.

Your company uses Java as its primary development language. Your company is researching how to create serverless functions in Azure to simplify event reporting. You've been asked to create a cloud-based function that triggers when specific values are passed in the HTTP request and outputs a log entry to track the activity.

In this module, you'll use an archetype to create a function project. You'll develop and test the function locally before deploying it to Azure. Once deployed, you'll test it and then make changes to the function.

By the end of this module, you'll use Maven to compile and deploy a serverless azure function. Also, you'll know how to use Azure monitoring tools to track its usage.

## Learning objectives

- Use the Azure Functions Maven Plugin
- Create a function project using an archetype
- Run the function locally
- Deploy the function to Azure
- Make changes and redeploy
