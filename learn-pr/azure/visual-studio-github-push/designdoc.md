3. Make and push commits to a remote branch

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Add a GitHub account to VS | GitHub account is required to backup your code on GitHub | Knowledge Check | 1 | Yes |
| Create a new local project | New projects are used to start coding in VS | Exercise | 2 | No, combine with 'Create a local Git repo' |
| Create a local Git repo | Local Git repos store version history | Exercise | 2 | Yes |
| Push the repo to GitHub | Once code is pushed, GitHub stores a copy | Exercise | 2 | No, combine with 'Create a local Git repo' |
| Make a change to the code | Explore the Git Changes window | Exercise | 3 | No, combine with 'Commit the change' |
| Commit the change | save the code you added | Exercise | 3 | Yes |
| Push the change to remote | store the code on a GitHub backup| Exercise | 3 | Yes |
| View the branch history | See how to manage the changes you made | Exercise | 3 | No, combine with 'Push the change to remote' |


## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice:

    *Add your scenario [(Scenario guidance)](/help/learn/id-guidance-scenarios)*

    Suppose you are creating a tictactoe game. You want to make sure your code is backed up so that you don't lose it. You also want to share the game with your friends so they can also see what you've created.

    Suppose you join a new software development team working in C# and .NET using Visual Studio 2019.  While some team members are comfortable with using git from the command line, others are less confident with working in the command line and would prefer a more visual, integrated experience.  Your management team asks you to evaluate which tools are available to help developers work effectively with git repositories and execute git commands. You heard that thereâ€™s new tooling from Microsoft that could help developers work worry free and mistake-free right from within Visual Studio 2019.
