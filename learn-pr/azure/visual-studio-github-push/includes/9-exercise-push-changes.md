See here for general guidance on exercise units: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-structure-exercise-content?branch=master

The titles of exercise units specified in the YAML should be prefixed with "Exercise - ".

If your module uses sample code or other supporting resources, talk to your contact on the Learn team about creating an official GitHub repository for the module in the MicrosoftDocs organization. Check with your contact before using code or resources from any other source, including official Microsoft sources.

SANDBOXES: There's lots to know about sandbox restrictions, limitations and initial setup - it's best to talk to your contact on the Learn team. The following guidance focuses on actually using the sandbox within your content:

- YAML and resource group referencing: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-use-sandbox?branch=master
- Cloud shell: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-sandbox-use-the-cloudshell?branch=master
- Azure portal: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-sandbox-use-azure-portal?branch=master
- Task validation - confirming resource creation and configuration: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-sandbox-add-task-validation?branch=master
