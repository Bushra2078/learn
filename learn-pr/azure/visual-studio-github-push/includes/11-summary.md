See here for general guidance on summary units: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-module-summary-unit?branch=master

The final unit of a module must follow the above guidance, and be named "Summary".

Modules that use the sandbox should usually contain the following include in the summary unit:

Summary units often contain a subsection called "Learn more" or "Further reading", with a bulleted list of appropriate external links

Suppose you join a new software development team working in C# and .NET using Visual Studio 2019.  While some team members are comfortable with using git from the command line, others are less confident with working in the command line and would prefer a more visual, integrated experience.  Your management team asks you to evaluate which tools are available to help developers work effectively with git repositories and execute git commands. You heard that thereâ€™s new tooling from Microsoft that could help developers work worry free and mistake-free right from within Visual Studio 2019.

Some of our team members aren't comfortable using the command line for their Git operations. We needed to evaluate Visual Studio 2019 as a fully integrated Git tool for our GitHub repository. Through Visual Studio, we created a new repository with just a few clicks. The Git Changes and Git repository windows along with the top level Git menu allowed us to access commands for staging changes, making commits, and pushing commits to the remote origin. With the visual user interface, we didn't have to remember any syntax for Git commands.

Imagine how much work it would be to go outside of Visual Studio for our Git tooling. We would be forced to constantly switch back and forth between Visual Studio and other apps. To create a repository, we'd need to start in the browser, go to the command line or another tool, and then move back to the IDE for coding. Continuous context switching causes a mental overhead that all of us want to avoid. Visual Studio makes it all easy. On top of that, Visual Studio has safety rails built in to make sure we're not doing anything dangerous without understanding the full impact. Setting up a new repository took less than half an hour. We can now forget about Git complexities, and focus on our code.
