Some of our team members aren't comfortable using the command line for their Git operations. We needed to evaluate Visual Studio as a fully integrated Git tool for our GitHub repository. Through Visual Studio, we created a new repository with just a few clicks. The Git Changes and Git repository windows along with the top level Git menu allowed us to access commands for staging changes, making commits, and pushing commits to the remote origin. With the visual user interface, we didn't have to remember any syntax for Git commands.

Imagine how much work it would be to go outside of Visual Studio for our Git tooling. We would be forced to constantly switch back and forth between Visual Studio and other apps. To create a repository, we'd need to start in the browser, go to the command line or another tool, and then move back to the IDE for coding. Continuous context switching causes a mental overhead that all of us want to avoid. Visual Studio makes it all easy. On top of that, Visual Studio has safety rails built in to make sure we're not doing anything dangerous without understanding the full impact. We can now forget about Git complexities, and focus on our code.
