In the scenario for this module, some of your team members weren't comfortable using the command line for their Git operations. You needed to evaluate Visual Studio as a fully integrated Git tool for your GitHub repository. 

Through Visual Studio, you created a new repository with just a few clicks. You used the **Git Changes** and **Git Repository** windows, along with the top-level **Git** menu, to access commands for staging changes, making commits, and pushing commits to the remote origin. With the visual user interface, you didn't have to remember any syntax for Git commands.

Imagine how much work it would be to go outside Visual Studio for your Git tooling. You would be forced to constantly switch back and forth between Visual Studio and other apps. To create a repository, you'd need to start in the browser, go to the command line or another tool, and then move back to the IDE for coding. 

Continuous context switching causes a mental overhead that all of us want to avoid. Visual Studio makes it all easy. On top of that, Visual Studio has safety rails to make sure you're not doing anything dangerous without understanding the full impact. You can now forget about Git complexities and focus on your code.
