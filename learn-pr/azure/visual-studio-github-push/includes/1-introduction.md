Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that many software developers use around the world. GitHub is a version control platform for hosting development projects. You can use GitHub to back up your code and collaborate with others. Visual Studio provides an integrated GitHub experience, so it's easier for you to manage projects from inside your code editor.

Suppose you join a new software development team that's working in C# and .NET by using Visual Studio. Some team members are comfortable with using Git from the command line. Others are less confident with working in the command line and would prefer a more visual, integrated experience.  

Your management team asks you to evaluate the available tools to help developers work effectively with Git repositories and run Git commands. You heard that new tooling from Microsoft might help developers work worry-free and mistake-free from within Visual Studio. 

In this module, you'll use the GitHub integration in Visual Studio to sign in to GitHub, create a new repository, and push commits. And you'll do all that without leaving the IDE. 

You'll complete exercises by using the Git Centralized Workflow. A Git workflow is a way to use Git effectively and consistently to accomplish work. Several publicized workflows act as guidelines for using Git. In the Centralized Workflow, you'll work on a single default branch and push all commits directly to that branch. This workflow is great for small teams and solo developers. 

By the end of this module, you'll know how to use GitHub and source control features inside Visual Studio. Before you start the next unit, it's worthwhile to become familiar with the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
