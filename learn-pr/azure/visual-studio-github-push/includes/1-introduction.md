Visual Studio is a fully integrated development environment that many software developers use around the world. GitHub is a version control platform for hosting development projects. You can use GitHub to back up your code and collaborate with others. Visual Studio provides an integrated GitHub experience, making it easier for you to manage projects from inside your code editor.

Suppose you join a new software development team working in C# and .NET using Visual Studio 2019.  While some team members are comfortable with using git from the command line, others are less confident with working in the command line and would prefer a more visual, integrated experience.  Your management team asks you to evaluate which tools are available to help developers work effectively with git repositories and execute git commands. You heard that thereâ€™s new tooling from Microsoft that could help developers work worry free and mistake-free right from within Visual Studio 2019. 

In this module, you'll use the GitHub integration inside Visual Studio 2019 to sign in to GitHub, create a new repository, and push commits - all without leaving the IDE.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to use GitHub and source control features inside Visual Studio 2019. It is worthwhile to first be familiar with the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) so you can hit the ground running.

Guidance for all content:

 - Ignore the linter warning about how the first line of a unit should be a header. The platform renders the unit title as an H1 at the top. All headers used in content should be H2 or smaller.
 - Links to other content (in Learn, Docs or anywhere else), put them in a section in the final Summary unit called "Learn more" or "Further reading" or something similar. If you need to mention the external resources in the content, indicate to the user that links are located at the end of the module.
- All content, including images, must be original and not copied from Docs or anywhere else.
- Screenshots: see https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-create-screenshot?branch=master for requirements and guidance.
- Conceptual images and diagrams: Don't spend lots of time creating polished diagrams. Work with the Learn team to submit a conceptual image creation request if new art is needed.
- Video: Work with your contact on the Learn team.
- Zone pivots: See https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/unit-add-zone-pivots?branch=master
- Think carefully about the knowledge prerequisites you declare for your content, and use them to shape the content and keep the scope reasonable. In both conceptual content and exercise steps, don't dwell on things you expect the reader to already know and understand.
- Feel free to use HTML comments like these during authoring. They show up in published content as HTML comments - the platform doesn't render them on the page, but they are present in the page source, so remove them all before publishing.

Guidance for content and exercise units:

- Most standard content should generally follow a pattern of alternating between "content" units and "exercise" units. See https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-standardmodules?branch=master
- Don't include a summary section in individual units
- Don't include a sentence or section to transition to the next unit. The platform will insert the name of the next unit above the navigation button at the bottom
