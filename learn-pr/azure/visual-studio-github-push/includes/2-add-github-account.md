There are a variety of ways that you might use GitHub with a project. Sometimes you clone a project to get a copy of it that you can work on. Sometimes, it goes the other direction and you have a local project that you want to put in GitHub.

Before you can do anything at all with GitHub, you have to make sure that you can authenticate so that GitHub knows who you are and can give you access to the right repositories. Normally, this can be a tedious, multi-step process that involves generating and working with SSH keys. One benefit of using Visual Studio to work with GitHub is that it handles all of the authentication setup for you.

## Adding an account to Visual Studio

In Visual Studio 2019, you normally have a single Personalization Account that you use to sign in to the IDE. However, you can add additional accounts to your Visual Studio keychain. This gives you the ability to access resources that require authenticating with these accounts in Visual Studio. 

Only one GitHub account can be added to Visual Studio. If you need to access resources from a different account, youâ€™ll need to remove any existing GitHub account from Visual Studio, sign out from the web (GitHub.com), and then restart the process for adding the new GitHub account to Visual Studio.

## GitHub Authentication in Visual Studio

When you sign in with your GitHub account, Visual Studio will store those credentials securely and can now help you access GitHub features. Visual Studio will let you browse private and public GitHub repositories to clone local copies or create new repositories in GitHub.
