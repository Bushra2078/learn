Signing in to a GitHub account via Visual Studio will allow you to access your GitHub resources within Visual Studio. You can still use the basic Git tooling in Visual Studio without signing in to GitHub. But to create new repositories and push to GitHub, you'll need to sign in.

In this exercise, you'll add a GitHub account to your Visual Studio keychain and authenticate to use GitHub resources.

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Visual Studio installed. Open Visual Studio, go to the **Help** menu, and select **Check for Updates**.

2. If you're not already signed in to Visual Studio, select the **Sign in** button in the upper-right corner of the Visual Studio window. Continue to sign in with your work or personal account.

5. You're redirected to the GitHub sign in page in your default browser. Enter your GitHub credentials and select **Sign in**. You might need to enter an authentication code for two-factor authentication.

You can verify by going back to Visual Studio. The **Account Settings** window now shows your GitHub account added under **All Accounts**. You can also remove an account from Visual Studio through the **Account Settings** window.
