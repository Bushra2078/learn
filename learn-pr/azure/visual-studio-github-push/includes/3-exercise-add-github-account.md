Signing in to a GitHub account via Visual Studio will allow you to access your GitHub resources within Visual Studio. You can still use the basic Git tooling in Visual Studio without signing in to GitHub. But to create new repositories and push to GitHub, you'll need to sign in.
In this exercise, you'll add a GitHub account to your Visual Studio keychain and authenticate to use GitHub resources.

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Visual Studio installed. Launch Visual Studio, go to the **Help** menu, and **Check for Updates**.

You can verify by going back to Visual Studio. The Account Settings window will now show your GitHub account added under the All Accounts section. You can also remove an account from Visual Studio through the Account Settings window.
