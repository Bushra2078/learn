          isCorrect: true

        - content: "Endpoint paths cannot be customized."
          isCorrect: false

        - content: "Go to your resource in the Azure portal and view the configuration."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The configuration for your resource in the Azure portal allows you to view or modify the configuration of the resource. It does not show the progress of your build and redeployment of your web app."
        - content: "Push your commits to your watched branched of your git repository."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Pushing your commits will not show your progress, but it will trigger a GitHub Actions workflow."
        - content: "Create a preview URL by creating a pull request against the branch that your GitHub Action is watching."

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You can configure the location of your code, artifacts, and API in the GitHub Actions workflow file. If you do not specify these locations, default values will be used."

          isCorrect: true
