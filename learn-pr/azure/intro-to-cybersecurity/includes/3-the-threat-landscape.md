*Threat intelligence* is knowledge that you can use to prevent or mitigate cyberattacks. It helps you make informed decisions about your security by helping you answer important questions. Those question include who's attacking you, what are their motivations and capabilities, and what indicators of compromise can you search for in your systems. The threat landscape is in constant motion. For example, organized criminals are moving from traditional criminal activities to cybercrime. 

The following list includes the most common cybercrime attacks today:

- Intellectual property theft.
- Destruction of property and/or IT resources.
- Identity theft.
- Social engineering attacks.
- Espionage.
- Surveillance of enemies or dissidents.
- Sowing confusion.

Nation-state attacks typically come from other countries/regions. It's difficult, or even impossible, to prove who ordered the attack. Using contracted hackers is common to lower the risk of political consequences. Cybercrime on a global and political scale is happening and, in many cases, helps to support an underground economy.

#### Overview of common attack exploits

#### Network attacks

A *Denial of Service* attack comes in two forms. Both forms overload a system, server, or network with traffic. Regardless of whether legitimate or malformed, this traffic overload means normal functions can't occur.

The two variants are:

- *Denial of service (DoS)*– An attack where a computer sends many requests to a network service to overwhelm the target service.
- *Distributed denial of service (DDoS)*- A DoS attack using multiple computers in several locations.

#### Social engineering exploitation

Social engineering impersonation refers to an unauthorized person who gains the trust of an authorized person. The goal is usually something nefarious. When their target is a company's employee, they often masquerade as upper management, technical support, or a trusted group member. Social engineering exploits the human element, which typically is the weakest link in security.

Email malware is a form of social engineering. Phishing and Spear Phishing are probably the most common social-engineering attacks. Messages are delivered to a user’s inbox. they appear to be from a work colleague, friend, or reputable person or company. The email includes an attachment or a URL to select. We’re all commonly warned not to select on unknown attachments, but every day people do.

In 2011, a security infrastructure company was the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack using a phishing email. The email was reported to come from a recruiter. It included a spreadsheet to calculate what your salary should be. Four employees opened the spreadsheet. Inside the spreadsheet was a zero-day Flash exploit. The exploit installed a backdoor for accessing their computers. When the attack was mitigated, it was estimated to have cost \$66.3 million.

Minor updates made to social media can be used by malicious hackers to take aggressive action against individuals or their companies. Updates on LinkedIn or likes and shared photos on social media sites are all fodder for bad actors. Hackers use open-source Artificial Intelligence (AI) to scan social media posts and sites to harvest details about a person’s activities. The AI tools can check millions of profiles and updates, searching for specific vulnerabilities to use in a future targeted attack. This data can then be used in a spear-phishing attack.

For example, you and your team members have returned from a group meeting. You post a photo with the caption: "Great to see everyone in person again! I brought treats from Fourth Coffee!” The hacker reads your "great to be back" post and sends an email to you, supposedly from Fourth Coffee. “Thanks for allowing us to be part of your return to the office celebration. Here is a link for a 15 percent discount on your next visit.” But the link actually installs malware on your system. Unfortunately, hackers are using AI to improve their tools and techniques.

Another example is when social engineering was used to spread a phone attack. The attack was against a popular phone operating system. It masqueraded as an operating-system update. When users downloaded the updated app, it prompted them for administrative credentials. The app then installed its malicious payload with administrative privileges. The app was downloaded from a third-party website. That should have been a warning sign. Apps should always be downloaded from the applicable app store.

Other social engineering attacks are:

- *Vishing* – like phishing but uses voice mail calls. With the advent of robocalling, it’s an effective method of attack.
- *Baiting* – also like phishing, but the attacker offers a fake reward or prize.
- *Tailgating* – following an authorized person into a secure location. The tailgating person is often not permitted to enter that location.

#### Browser attacks

Whether on a desktop, laptop, or phone, browsers are an important access tool for the internet. Security vulnerabilities in a browser can have a significant impact because of their pervasiveness. A browser's render engine is even built into your email application to review HTML-based email. Besides rendering webpages, browsers have taken on other jobs over time. Modern browsers work with the operating system to:

- Cache and help resolve     DNS addresses.
- Verify digital certificates.
- Encode requests in HTTPS.
- Store or share Cookies that help websites track visitors.

All these new browsers features accelerated the growth and innovation of the 'WWW'. They also accelerated the hacking business that exploited security flaws. Securing their browser software is a priority for vendors and website owners.

Browser *modifiers* are hacks designed to change a browser's security setting without the user’s knowledge. These changes can allow for downloading and installing add-ons, injection of ads, and even modifying pop-up blocker settings. The initial hack is usually a social engineering attack.

Another browser attack is known as *cross-site scripting (XSS)*. In XSS attacks, malicious code, typically JavaScript, is placed within a trusted website. The goal of this kind of attack is that the code is executed within the site visitor's browser. Modern browsers now use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to detect and mitigate XSS attacks.

#### Data Breach

A 2021 investigation report details how more than 90 percent of companies that acknowledge they've been hacked were alerted to the hack from entities outside their organizations. A recent data breach involved *shadow IT*. Some employees were using a not approved off-site storage solution. The users received what seemed to be a valid email. It asked them to visit the link and change their passwords because a hack had compromised their user-account information. Some users responded that they thought they were changing their password. Instead, they gave their account information to hackers. With that information, the hackers were able to steal data from the cloud storage vendor. they then used that account information to move into the company’s networked computers. The term for unauthorized removal of data is *Data Exfiltration*.

The company's IT department eventually discovered this data loss and internal system compromise. Employees then were questioned about using the unauthorized cloud storage instead of Office365 and OneDrive. They said they used the cloud storage from home and just continued to use it.
