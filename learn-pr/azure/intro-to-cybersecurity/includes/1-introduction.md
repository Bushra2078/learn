Understanding fundamental cybersecurity concepts is a first step toward countering increasing cyberthreats around the world. This module provides basic security-awareness training, which is the foundation of helping make end users less vulnerable.

Suppose you work at Contoso, Ltd. a small but rapidly growing company. They're aggressively moving their services to Azure. The Contoso Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has read news reports about recent cyberattacks on companies, along with malware infected laptops and wants to invest more in cybersecurity.

The CEO knows about your interest in cybersecurity, so they ask you to develop security training for Contoso employees. They believe building security awareness is essential to help mitigate social engineering and other security-related attacks. To accomplish this task, you must learn more about cybersecurity.

After completing this module, you will have acquired some fundamental cyber-security terminology, be able to describe different types of exploits, be able to describe mitigation strategies.
