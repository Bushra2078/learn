Monitoring is important. Depending on your architecture, it can be even a bit tricky. It might be even more challenging but also important for distributed systems.

## Monitor real-time applications

We learned that in real time systems tasks perform their function within prescribed deadlines. So let's

1. Define every individual task of the system.
2. Predefine the deadlines for each functionality of our application.
3. Monitor and check the deadlines regularly.
4. Have an alarms and strategies setup if the tasks miss the deadlines.
5. Try to automate!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to define the individual tasks as modular as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to have a reliable system at any time. Automation is key to not be dependant on someones sleeping or holiday's schedule.

## Monitor event-driven application stacks



If your event-driven application stack is a distributed system, don't forget to proper monitor each of infrastructure peace as well as the whole system.
