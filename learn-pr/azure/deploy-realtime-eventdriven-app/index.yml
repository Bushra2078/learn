title: Deploy Event-driven real-time app to Azure
summary: Send event based telemetric data in real time to Cosmos DB using Azure Functions and Event Hub.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Explain event-driven and real-time workloads.
  - Create a scenario with simulated telemetric data.
  - Send the telemetric data with an Azure Function to an Event Hub.
  - Connect another function this Event Hub to trigger a storage in Cosmos DB.
  - Have a look at the metrics in Application Insights to measure the performance and identify potential bottle necks.
prerequisites: | 
  - An Azure subscription
  - Local installations of Java JDK (1.8 or later), Maven (3.0 or later), and the Azure CLI (2.12 or later)
