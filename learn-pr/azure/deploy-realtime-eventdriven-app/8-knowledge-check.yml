  questions:
  - content: "How fast is real time?"
    choices:
    - content: "Two seconds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Two seconds are too much for real-time requirements."
    - content: "An instant, more properly defined by your specific use case."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Real-time tasks are performing with almost no delay. The execution time should be defined in advanced and monitored properly."
    - content: "Under 1 millisecond."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wow, that's fast. Could be, but the execution time depends on your specific use case."
  - content: 'Which of the following databases are best to perform event driven workloads?'
    choices:
    - content: Cosmos DB
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Yes, Cosmos DB ensures single-digit millisecond response times, and automatic and instant scalability. But aren't you missing one?"
    - content: MySQL
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Mysql Database is a fully managed database service that lets developers quickly develop and deploy secure cloud-native applications also for event driven workloads. But aren't you missing one?"
    - content: PostgreSQL
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service based on the open-source Postgres database engine. It's a fully managed database-as-a-service that can handle mission-critical workloads with predictable performance, security, high availability, and dynamic scalability. But aren't you missing one?"
    - content: All of them.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes, using an event-driven workload does not limit you from a specific database. Choose the one fitting best to your given scenario."
  - content: "How should events be build?"
    choices:
    - content: "Events should be build generic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Generic events might look like a good idea for improved maintainability, but result to likely in large events and disable loose coupling."
    - content: "Event should be precise and lightweight."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All events should be as precise and lightweight as possible to save network load and simplicity."
    - content: "Events should always follow a convention."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Naming conventions might be helpful, but for the overall event building other things are more important."
