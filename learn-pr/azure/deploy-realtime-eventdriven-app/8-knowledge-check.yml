      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Two seconds are too much for real-time requirements."
    - content: "An instant, more properly defined by your specific use case."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Real-time tasks are performing with almost no delay. The execution time should be defined in advanced and monitored properly."
    - content: "Under 1 millisecond."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wow, that's fast. Could be, but the execution time depends on your specific use case."

      explanation: "MySQL doesn't support instant scalability."
    - content: PostgreSQL
      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "Correct. All events should be as precise and lightweight as possible to save network load and simplicity."
    - content: "Events should always follow a convention."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Naming conventions might be helpful, but for the overall event building other things are more important."
