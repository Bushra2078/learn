  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Small block sizes will reduce performance your file sizes are:"
    choices:
    - content: "Small files"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Small block sizes combined with small file sizes will not impair performance"
    - content: "Large Files"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Small block sizes combined with large files results in lower performance due to breaking down large files to fit the smaller block size"

  - content: "If you have a disk that supports 5000 IOPS and your block size is 4K, your total possible throughput is"
    choices:
    - content: "9 MB/s"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "5000 IOPS * 4K block size = 20 MB/s"
    - content: "15 MB/s"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "5000 IOPS * 4K block size = 20 MB/s"
    - content: "20 MB/s"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "5000 IOPS * 4K block size = 20 MB/s"
