  questions:
  - content: "What is meant by the terms failover, and failback in the context of disaster recovery?"
    choices:
    - content: Failover is the transfer of workload from the secondary site to a primary site, during a test or disaster recovery scenario. Failback is when the workload gets transferred back to the secondary site.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These descriptions are incorrect as they're the wrong way round
    - content: Failover is the time taken between discovering there has been a disaster, and invoking actual disaster recovery. Failback is the time taken between fixing the disaster and the environment is running from the primary site again.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Neither of these definitions are correct as they mention time taken, which is incorrect.
    - content: Failover is the transfer of workload to a secondary site, during a test or disaster scenario. Failback is when the workload gets transferred back over to the primary site, from the secondary.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These descriptions are correct. A failover is when the primary site fails over to the secondary, and a failback is the reverse of this.
  - content: "What is the correct order for the four stages of failover and failback when replicating your on-premises environment to Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: Re-protect Azure virtual machines by replicating back to on-premises. Fail over to the secondary site on Azure. Failback to the primary on-premises site. Re-protect the on-premises virtual machines by replicating to Azure
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These stages are all correct but in the wrong order. The order should be; fail over to Azure, re-protect Azure, failback to on-premises, re-protect on-premises 
    - content: Failback to the primary on-premises site. Re-protect the on-premises virtual machines by replicating to Azure. Fail over to the secondary site on Azure. Re-protect the Azure virtual machines by replicating back to on-premises
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These stages are all correct but in the wrong order. The order should be; fail over to Azure, re-protect Azure, failback to on-premises, re-protect on-premises
    - content: Fail over to the secondary site on Azure. Re-protect the Azure virtual machines by replicating back to on-premises. Failback to the primary on-premises site. Re-protect the on-premises virtual machines by replicating to Azure
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These are the correct steps in the correct order
