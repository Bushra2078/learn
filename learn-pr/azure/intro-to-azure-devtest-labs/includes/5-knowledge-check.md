In your e-commerce company, you want to create a custom VM image for your new developers within DevTest Labs, while also managing costs.

Here, you'll examine this scenario in detail before deciding how best to create a base image with artifacts.  Policies will then be applied to the DevTest lab to limit spending.

## Create developer VM image

Your developers run environments based on the .NET Core technology stack and use REACT as a front-end client-side framework. 

You also want to allow developers to make changes to the default VM image. As technology moves on, the VM image should be altered.

## Limit spending

The company has cost constraints for developer and test environments. You'll need to make sure any VMs or resources aren't allowed to exceed the budget.
