There are many use cases and advantages to be gained from a cloud solution for development testing and development virtual machines. 

In your e-commerce company, you've decided to use Azure DevTest Labs to manage training environments that will help you onboard new developers quickly. However, you also want to know whether DevTest Labs can help you manage your testing and staging environments.

In this unit, you'll learn about common business problems that DevTest Labs can help to address.

## Cloud or on-premises solutions

In today's environments, developers might find that on-premises solutions take a long time to provision. They're often slowed down by approvals and red tape. There might also be problems caused by a limited hardware budget. These drawbacks could produce the following issues:

- Compromised agility
- Limited software licensing
- Resource contention with virtual machines
- Difficulty in setting up realistic scale tests
- Procurement delays

By using Azure DevTest Labs, you can reduce these delays because many restrictions don't apply in the cloud. Users can create labs with a few clicks without having to wait for hardware delivery or approvals. An on-premises environment doesn't have the same flexibility to grow on demand, which can slow the code development process.

Common problems with on-premises solutions are:

- Provisioning of infrastructure takes too long
- System configuration takes more time
- Costs can be out of control
- Usage isn't predictable

You can help eliminate these problems by using the features in the following table:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Self-service** | You control the number of virtual machines each user can have. You can also create policies to automatically close virtual machines, depending on your business agenda or other criteria. |
| **Ready to use** | Reusable templates supply everything your developers need to start developing and testing applications. With a few clicks, you'll create an environment where your application's most up-to-date build is ready and you can start working immediately. |
| **Fast provisioning** | Start within minutes of requesting an environment. |

## Dev machines and test environments

The two most common use cases that DevTest Labs addresses are:

- Development virtual machines in the cloud
- Test environments

Let's examine these use cases in more detail.

### Development machines in the cloud

Developing software is a complex and often difficult process. Because there are many aspects to consider, it might be easier to manage them in the cloud. For example, how can you:

- Make sure that every developer on the team has the same libraries and applications, so that everything works the same for all parties?
- Provide a fresh development machine to new developers, so they can start contributing immediately?
- Enable remote working?

### Test environments

DevTest Labs is also a great fit for handling test servers. You can set up servers with auto-shutdown to help control spending. You don't pay for virtual machines when they're turned off, so you can reduce costs by switching off unused machines.

If you're using Azure for production, the virtual machines will be close to the rest of your Azure resources, which makes it an ideal partner.

To automate as much as possible, you can integrate Azure DevTest Labs with your preferred build and release tool.
