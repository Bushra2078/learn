There are many advantages to be gained from a cloud solution for development testing and using development VMs.

In your e-commerce company, you've decided to use Azure DevTest Labs to manage training environments to quickly onboard new developers. You also want to know whether DevTest Labs can help you manage your testing and staging environments.

In this unit, you learn about common business problems that DevTest Labs can help to address.

## Cloud or on-premises solutions

In today's environments, developers might find that on-premises solutions take a long time to set up. They're often made too slow by approval processes and red tape. There might also be problems caused by a limited hardware budget. These drawbacks can produce the following issues:

- Compromised agility
- Limited software licensing
- Resource contention with VMs
- Difficulty in setting up realistic scale tests
- Procurement delays

By using Azure DevTest Labs, you can reduce these delays because many restrictions don't apply in the cloud. Users can create labs easily without needing to wait for hardware delivery or approvals.

In contrast, because an on-premises environment doesn't have the same flexibility to grow on demand, it can slow the software development process. Common problems with on-premises solutions are:

- Provisioning of infrastructure takes too long
- System configuration takes more time
- Costs can be prohibitive
- Usage isn't predictable

You can help eliminate these problems by using these Azure DevTest Labs features:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Self-service** | You control the number of VMs each user can have. You can also create policies to automatically close VMs, depending on your business agenda or other criteria. |
| **Ready to use** | Reusable templates supply everything your developers need to start developing and testing applications. They enable you to easily create an environment where your application's most up-to-date build is ready and you can start working immediately. |
| **Fast provisioning** | Start within minutes of requesting an environment. |

## Development machines and test environments

The two most common use cases that DevTest Labs addresses are:

- VMs in the cloud
- Test environments

These use cases are described in the following sections.

### Development machines in the cloud

Developing software is a complex and often difficult process. Because there are many aspects to consider, it's often easier to manage it in the cloud. For example, using the cloud can help with the following tasks:

- Ensuring that every developer on the team has the same libraries and applications, so that everything works the same for all parties.
- Providing a fresh development machine to new developers, so they can start contributing immediately.
- Enabling remote working.

### Test environments

DevTest Labs is also a great fit for handling test servers. You can set up servers with autoshutdown to help control spending. Test environments in the cloud have the following advantages:

- Because you don't pay for VMs when they're turned off, you can reduce costs by switching off unused machines.

- If you're using Azure for production, the VMs are close to the rest of your Azure resources, which makes it an ideal partner.

- You can automate your operations by integrating Azure DevTest Labs with your preferred build and release tool.
