There are many use cases and advantages to be gained from a cloud solution for Dev testing and Dev machines. 

In your e-commerce company, you decided to use Azure DevTest Labs to manage training environments that will help to onboard new developers quickly. However, you also want to know if DevTest Labs can help you manage your testing and staging environments.

Here, you'll learn about common business problems, which DevTest Labs can help to address.

## Cloud or on-premises solutions

In today's environments, developers might find that on-premises solutions take a long time to provision and often get slowed up in approvals and red tape. There may also be problems caused by a limited hardware budget. This situation could produce the following issues:

- Compromised agility
- Limited software licensing
- Resource contention with virtual machines
- Difficulty in setting up realistic scale tests
- Procurement delays

By using Azure DevTest Labs, can you reduce these delays because many restrictions don't apply in the cloud. Users can create labs with a few clicks without having to wait for hardware delivery or approvals. An on-premises environment doesn't have the same flexibility to grow on demand, which can slow the code development process.

Common problems with on-premises solutions are:

- Provisioning of infrastructure takes too long
- System configuration takes more time
- Costs can be out of control
- Usage isn't predictable

Azure DevTest Labs enables you to eliminate these problems by:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Self-service** | It lets you control the number of virtual machines each user can have. You could also create policies to automatically close virtual machines, based on your business agenda or other criteria. |
| **Ready to use** | Use reusable templates that supply everything your developers need to start developing and testing applications. With a few clicks, you'll have an environment where the most up-to-date build of your application is ready. You can start working immediately. |
| **Fast provisioning** | Start within minutes of requesting an environment. |

## Dev machines and test environments

The two most common use cases that DevTest Labs addresses are:

- Development virtual machines in the cloud
- Test environments

Let's examine these use cases in more detail.

### Dev machines in the cloud

Developing software is a complex and often difficult process. With many aspects to consider, it might be easier to manage them in the cloud. For example, how can you:

- Make sure that every developer on the team has the same libraries and applications so that everything works the same for all parties.
- Provide a fresh development machine to new developers, so they can start contributing immediately.
- Enable remote working.

### Test environments

DevTest Labs is also a great fit for handling test servers. You can set up servers with auto-shutdown to help control spending. You don't pay for a virtual machine when it's turned off, so you can save money by switching off an unused machine.

If you're using Azure for production, the virtual machines will be close to the rest of your Azure resources, which makes it an ideal partner.

You can integrate Azure DevTest Labs with your preferred build and release tool, to automate as much as possible.
