In this module, you wanted to evaluate whether Azure DevTest Labs would be a good choice as an environment for onboarding new developers. All developer tools would need to be effective. You've seen how to use base images and artifacts in DevTest Labs for quick ways to get started, without the procurement and setup problems that are tied to on-premises solutions.

You now understand how to quickly provision environments by using reusable templates and formulas. You've also seen how to spin up PaaS resources, such as Azure Service Fabric, by using Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). You know how to create IaaS virtual machines and assign them to users.

Finally, you were introduced to various ways to manage the cost of DevTest Labs. Use policies to govern such things as virtual machine size and auto-shutdown schedules.
