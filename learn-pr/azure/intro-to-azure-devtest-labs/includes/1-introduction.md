The overhead of onboarding developers into new systems is getting more difficult and costly. Most modern systems can house multiple technology stacks, which often require a large setup and expensive environments. The same is also true for creating development and test environments. Azure DevTest Labs can simplify and accelerate the process of creating virtual computing environments.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for an e-commerce company that uses systems enabling orders to be placed and processed using many different technologies. Some of these systems are for offline processing and some are in real time. Your company wants to reduce the time and money spent to onboard new developers by creating virtual machines set up with systems already configured and installed. They want to look at the options available with Azure.  

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll learn about how Azure DevTest Labs works and when it might be the right choice for your environment setup needs.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to evaluate whether Azure DevTest Labs is appropriate for setting up virtual machine environments for your team, and explain how the resource-creation features of DevTest Labs work to automate developer onboarding and the creation of deployment environments.
