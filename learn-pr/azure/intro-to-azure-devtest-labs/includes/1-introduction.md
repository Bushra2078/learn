When your company starts using a new system, it's important to onboard your developers.
Unfortunately, the overhead of onboarding developers into new systems is getting more difficult and costly. Most modern systems can house multiple technology stacks, which often require a large setup and expensive environments. The same is true for creating development and test environments. With Azure DevTest Labs, you can simplify and accelerate the process of creating virtual computing environments.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for an e-commerce company. Your company uses systems-enabling orders that are placed and processed by using different technologies. Some of these systems are for offline processing and some are for real time. Your company wants to reduce the time and money it spends to onboard new developers. To do so, it intends to create virtual machines that are set up with systems already configured and installed. Your company is curious about Azure and wants to see what it can offer.  

## Goals of this module

By the end of this module, you can:

- Evaluate whether Azure DevTest Labs is appropriate for setting up virtual machine environments for your team.
- Describe how the resource-creation features of DevTest Labs work to automate developer onboarding and the creation of deployment environments.
