The overhead of onboarding developers into new systems is getting more difficult and costly. Most modern systems can house multiple technology stacks, which often require a large setup and expensive environments. The same is also true for creating development and test environments. 

Suppose you work for an e-commerce company that uses systems enabling orders to be placed and processed using many different technologies. Some of these systems are for offline processing and some are in real time. Your company wants to reduce the time and money spent to onboard new developers by creating virtual machines set up with systems already configured and installed. They want to look at the options available with Azure.  

In this module, you'll learn about the Azure technologies that help you to create your own development machine test environments to simplify this procedure.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create Azure DevTest labs.
