  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your company wants to implement a custom image with a minimum of administrative effort. Which approach should you take?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure Lab Services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can't use Azure Lab Services for the practice environments, because it doesn't support custom virtual machine images."
    - content: "Use Azure DevTest Labs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure DevTest Labs supports custom images and provides tools that make it easy to control your resource usage."
    - content: "Configure a set of virtual machines by using a VHD image you create."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This approach is likely to require much more administrative effort than using Azure DevTest Labs."
  - content: "Your company wants to use DevTest Labs to install a required React JavaScript framework on the custom virtual machine image. Which approach should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use artifacts."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can use artifacts to run installation scripts to set up your dependencies."
    - content: "Use formulas."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Formulas provide a base image as a starting point. They don't enable installation scripts."
    - content: "Deploy a shell script to each virtual machine after it is provisioned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This approach is likely to require much more technical effort than using artifacts."
  - content: "You want to cap the size of the virtual machines that can be created within a DevTest Labs environment. Which approach should you should use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use formulas."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Formulas are a way of building virtual machine images. They don't handle usage caps."
    - content: "Use environments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Environments are templates that speed up image creation and associated PaaS resources. They don't handle usage caps."
    - content: "Use policies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can assign a maximum virtual machine size limit to the lab by using policies."
