  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your company wants to implement the custom image with the minimum of administrative effort. Which approach should you take?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure Lab Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can't use Azure Lab Services for the practice environments, because it doesn't support custom virtual machine images."
    - content: "Use Azure DevTest Labs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure DevTest Labs supports custom images and provides tools that make it easy to control your resource usage."
    - content: "Configure a set of virtual machines using a VHD image you create"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This approach is likely to require much more administrative effort than using Azure DevTest Labs."
  - content: "Your company wants to use DevTest Labs to install a required React JavaScript framework on the custom virtual machine image. Which approach should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use artifacts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can use artifacts to run install scripts to set up your dependencies"
    - content: "Use formulas"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Formulas provide a base image as a starting point. They don't enable install scripts."
    - content: "Deploy a shell script to each virtual machine after it is provisioned"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This approach is likely to require much more technical effort than using artifacts."
  - content: "You want to cap the size of the virtual machines that can be created within the DevTest Lab. Which approach should you should use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Formulas"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Formulas are a way of building virtual machine images. They don't handle usage caps."
    - content: "Environments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Environments are templates that speed up the image creation and associated PaaS resources. They don't handle usage caps."
