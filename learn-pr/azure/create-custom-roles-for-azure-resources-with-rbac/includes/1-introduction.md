With more IT resources being deployed and maintained in the cloud, governance is becoming granular and complex. It's important to understand how roles enable employees to complete their work while restricting access to parts of the system they don't maintain. This practice reduces errors and enables employees to keep focused in their own particular area.

Suppose you work for an organization where your team manages a website hosted on Azure VMs. You're assigned the Owner role for the subscription that contains the website's resources. To keep Azure resources secure, you segregate duties within your team and only grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job. You have a new employee who's responsible for managing VMs within the subscription. They need to monitor and do troubleshooting tasks like restarting the VMs.

In this module, you'll learn what custom roles are and how they're used to provide granular permissions.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to create custom roles for many resources within Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify role definition structure and properties.
- Create and manage a custom user role for Azure resource access management.

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of access management concepts in Azure, like role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure resources.
