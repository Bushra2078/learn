With more and more IT resources being deployed and maintained in the cloud, governance of these resources is becoming granular and complex. It is important to understand how roles can be used to enable employees to complete their work whilst restricting access to parts of the system they dont maintain. This will cut down on errors and enable employees to keep focussed in their own particular area.

Suppose you work for an organization where your team manages a website hosted on Azure VMs. You're assigned the Owner role for the subscription that contains the website's resources. To keep your Azure resources secure, you segregate duties within your team and only grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job. You have a new employee that's responsible for managing VMs within the subscription. They need to be able to monitor the VMs and do troubleshooting tasks like restarting the VMs.

In this module, you will learn what custom roles are and how they can be used to provide granular permissions

By the end of this module you will be able to create custom roles for many of the resources within Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify role definition structure and properties
- Create and manage a custom user role for Azure resource access management

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of access management concepts in Azure like role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure resources
