Getting the timing right of heading to the bus stop is a challenge that most can relate to. Azure Static Web Apps can help in getting real-time bus and geofence data from Azure SQL Database and surfacing it on a website.

In the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, or .NET), you used an Azure Function that's built-in to an Azure Static Web App to get the data for specific bus routes and geofences. The Azure Static Web App was then used to surface the map on a website.

Overall, you learned how to create and deploy static web apps with serverless APIs that make application development easier and faster. You also learned how Visual Studio Code, the Azure portal, and GitHub are integrated to give you an efficient and seamless way to maintain CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

If you continue in the learning path, the next module will cover putting all the services together: Azure Functions, Azure Static Web Apps, Azure Logic Apps, Azure SQL Database, and GitHub Actions.
