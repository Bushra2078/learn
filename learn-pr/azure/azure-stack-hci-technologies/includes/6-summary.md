Contoso is planning to migrate their outdated operational model, which has hardware reaching its end of life, to Azure. Contoso decides on using Azure Stack HCI as the optimum solution to modernize their on-premises workloads and streamline their operational model.

Azure Stack HCI includes several core technologies such as Hyper-V, Failover Clustering, software-defined storage, and SDN that help Contoso in its migration goal.

In this module, you learned about the technological foundations of Azure Stack HCI. This knowledge helped you with a successful implementation of the proof-of-concept environment, which led to migration of on-premises workloads to the Azure Stack HCI platform.
