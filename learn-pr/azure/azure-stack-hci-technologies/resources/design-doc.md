**Estimated unit duration:** 3 mins

### Module scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a medium-size financial-services company with its headquarters in New York and branch offices across the United States. It's currently operating almost entirely on-premises, with the majority of its servers running either Windows Server 2012 R2 or one of several Linux distributions. 

Contoso's IT director realizes that their organization has an outdated operational model with limited resiliency and hardware reaching end of life. The Contoso IT Engineering team is exploring the option of migrating some of the more critical workloads to Azure, however, due to regulatory and compliance constraints, in many cases, this is not the option. You, serving the role of the lead system engineer, suggested evaluating Azure Stack HCI as an alternative approach to modernize on-premises workloads, increase their resiliency, and streamline their operational model. 

In order to convince the IT management that this is the sound approach, you need to first explore and document the characteristics and capabilities of Azure Stack HCI technologies and implement a proof-of-concept environment that would help validate your suggestion.
