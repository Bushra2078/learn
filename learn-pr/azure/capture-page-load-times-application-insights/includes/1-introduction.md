Application Insights is the Azure service for monitoring live web applications. It can be enabled for an Azure App Service web app without modifying any of the app's code.

You work for a company that makes digital video cameras. You have an App Service web app that enables users of your products to upload and share their videos with the community.

The app was first deployed to Azure a few months ago. No Application Performance Management (APM) system was set up. Performance was initially good with no errors reported to clients. A few months after going live, however, user feedback indicates pages in the app load slowly. Without any kind of telemetry in place, your team wasn't even aware that the app was slow until users began complaining. Administrators and developers have no way to diagnose the problem, as the sparse trace output generated by the application isn't comprehensive enough to be helpful. You need to quickly instrument the app so you can diagnose and fix the performance problems.

This module will demonstrate how to enable Application Insights for an Azure web app without modifying its source code, and how to use it to capture information about page load times.
