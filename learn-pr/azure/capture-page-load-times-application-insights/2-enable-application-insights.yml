  title: Enable Application Insights on an Azure Web App
  questions:
  - content: "You want to make sure that administrators know as soon as a web app becomes overloaded. Which feature of Application Insights should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alerts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can create an alert that triggers when a condition is satisfied - for example when the web app is overloaded. When the alert triggers, you can configure it to send an email, for example, to inform administrators."
    - content: "Live metrics streams"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Live metrics streams will show whether a web app is overloaded but only when administrators are looking at them. To let administrators know at any time, use an alert."
    - content: "Usage Analysis"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Usage analysis will show past periods when the web app was heavily utilised but only when administrator consult them. To let administrators know at any time, use an alert."
  - content: "You have a Linux-based web app that runs in the Azure App Service. You want to display basic performance data in an Application Insights dashboard. Which method should you use to instrument your app?"
    choices:
    - content: "Runtime instrumentation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Runtime instrumentation is only available for Windows-based apps because it relies on features of IIS. For Linux-based apps, which run on Apache, you must use build-time instrumentation."
    - content: "Automatic client-side telemetry"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Automatic client-side telemetry is only available for Windows-based apps because it relies on features of IIS. For Linux-based apps, which run on Apache, you must use build-time instrumentation."
    - content: "Build-time instrumentation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Because this is a Linux-based app, you must use build-time instrumentation. Runtime instrumentation and automatic client-side telemetry are only available for Windows-based apps."
