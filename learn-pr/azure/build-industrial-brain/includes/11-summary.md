In this module, you used the chemical stirring tank example and you have learned:

- Building a multi-concept brain
- Defining machine teaching problem
- Translating the AI Specification document to the brain
- Assessing the training session through the training graph
- Evaluating brain performance through custom assessments and
- Querying assessment data for further analysis

Project Bonsai enables engineers to build AI-powered automation using the Machine Teaching paradigm. Engineers can design and train AI brains to do various tasks without data science. With the help of subject matter expertise, you add human intelligence to the machine learning process.

Simultaneously, engineers can safely and quickly validate brains in a simulated environment before deploying them in the real world.
