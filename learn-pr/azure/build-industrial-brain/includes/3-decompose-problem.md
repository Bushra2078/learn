Let's take a look at how this brain is designed. You can see the full AI specification document [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-machine-teaching-for-autonomous-ai/blob/main/MineCo%20Gyratory%20Crusher%20Optimization%20presentation.pptx?raw=true).

First, we start by defining input/states.

- The labels for our input states are Cr, Tr, Cref, Tref and Tc.
    - **Cr**: The measured residual concentration of our product at the reactor's outlet.
    - **Tr**: The measured temperature of our product at the reactor's outlet.
    - **Cref**: The reference residual concentration, which identifies the desired concentration at every timestep (for both steady-state and transient operation).
    - **Tref**: The reference reactor temperature, which identifies the desired reactor temperature at every timestep (for both steady-state and transient operation).
    - **Tc**: The coolant temperature of the reactor cooling jacket. The coolant is the controlling agent of the reactorâ€™s output concentration and temperature.

Then, we define the output of our brain, the control variable(s) of our reactor.

- The label for our output action is dTc
    - **dTc**: The increment (or decrement) of coolant temperature to be applied at any time with respect to the initial coolant temperature at steady-state conditions.

Finally, based on the scenarios our brain needs to be able to generalize to, we define a modular brain with the concepts/skills to be taught to the Autonomous AI brain.

- **Learned Concept 1**: **Steady State** - The brain is exposed to the steady-state scenario. It must learn to operate the reactor under continuous steady-state conditions.
- **Learned Concept 2**: **Modify Concentration** - The brain is exposed to transient scenarios. It must learn to operate the reactor under transient conditions by modifying the coolant concentration following the concentration reference (Cref).
- **Selector Concept**: **Select Strategy** - The brain is exposed to both steady-state and transient operation. We train a selector to learn under which conditions to apply each skill. It must learn the fuzzy boundary between steady-state control and transient operation.
