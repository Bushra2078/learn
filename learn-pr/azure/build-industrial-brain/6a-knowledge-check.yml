quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which is a goal objective of the skill/module 'Steady state'?"
    choices:
    - content: "Randomized noise up to 5%."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The amount of noise to train with is a lesson, not a goal."
    - content: "Minimize Concentration Reference."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Minimizing error to the concentration reference is one of the 2 goal objectives of our problem."
    - content: "Episode Iteration Limit set to 90."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The EIL is 90, as can be seen at the bottom of the picture. Yet, this is a training parameter, not a goal objective."
    - content: "Thermal runaway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Thermal runaway is a condition we need to prevent the brain from visiting. The corresponding goal objective related to this condition is to AVOID thermal runaway."
  - content: "The lesson to be learnt by the “Steady State” strategy is:"
    choices:
    - content: "Practice transient conditions (concentration reference signal, Cref_signal, equal to 1)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Look well at the lesson defined in the diagram above. Additionally, note that transient conditions should never be presented to the steady-state concept, since it is not the scenario it is meant to learn."
    - content: "Practice with different thermal runaway temperatures."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Thermal runaway is a goal not a lesson. Look at the image above and look for the definition of the lesson presented to the steady-state concept."
    - content: "Practice steady state conditions (concentration reference signal, Cref_signal, equal to 5)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This is the scenario for the steady-state condition."
    - content: "Thermal temperature equal to 400 degrees Kelvin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is the max temperature allowed by the reactor before it is considered to have thermal runaway, which we never want to reach. This is not a lesson the steady-state control seeks to learn."
