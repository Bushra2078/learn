quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "How many sensors or environment states the CSTR sample has?"
    choices:
    - content: "One"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The CSTR sample doesn’t have one environment state or sensor."
    - content: "Three"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The CSTR sample doesn’t have three environment states or sensors."
    - content: "Four"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The CSTR sample doesn’t have four environment states or sensors."
    - content: "Five"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The CSTR sample has five environment states or sensors (Cr, Tr, Cref, Tref, Tc)."
  - content: "What are the control actions of the CSTR sample?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cr"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cr is an environment state or sensor for the CSTR sample."
    - content: "Delta Tc(dTc)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Delta Tc(dTc) is a control action of CSTR."
    - content: "Cref"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cref is an environment state or sensor for the CSTR sample."
    - content: "Tc"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tc is an environment state or sensor for the CSTR sample."
  - content: "Select the strategies of the CSTR sample?"
    choices:
    - content: "Select Strategy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a selector module that chooses what strategy is best for each scenario."
    - content: "Cr, Tr, Cref, Tref, Tc"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These are environment states or sensors."
    - content: "Steady state and modify concentration"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Steady state and modify concentration are the two strategies of the CSTR sample."
    - content: "Delta Tc(dTc)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Delta Tc(dTc) is the control action."
