title: Build an industrial strength brain
summary: Train a modular brain for real industrial processes. Decompose the tasks into skills, do Machine Teaching experimentation to get the orchestration and the training completed successfully. Evaluate brain performance using training graphs and custom assessments.

  In this module, you'll learn how to:
  - Identify the benefits of "modular" brains against "monolithic" brains when tackling industrial use cases
  - Explore the Machine Teaching training strategies required to build industrial strength brains
  - Learn the benefits of using web visualizers and how to embed them into the Bonsai UI
  - Understand how Autonomous control can have a positive impact in process performance
  - Understand how industrial strength brains require more nuanced machine teaching
  - Describe how assessing a modular brain is different than assessing a monolithic brain
