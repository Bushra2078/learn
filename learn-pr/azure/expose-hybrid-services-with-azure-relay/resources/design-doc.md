# Title

Expose hybrid services securely with Azure Relay

## Role(s)

- Solution Architect

## Level

- Intermediate

## Product(s)

- Azure Relay

## Prerequisites

- None (unless exercises deem otherwise)

## Summary

Securely expose services that run in your on-premises network to without opening a port on your firewall, or making intrusive changes to your corporate network infrastructure.

## Learning objectives

1. Describe the features and use cases for Azure Relay.
1. Create an application and expose it to through Azure Relay.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Expose hybrid services securely with Azure Relay*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You work for an organization that has a service running in an on-premises environment that you need to integrate with applications running in the cloud. You're unable to move this application to Azure due to technical limitations, but would like to expose it securely, but without the network complexity that typically goes with exposing services to the internet. You think Azure Relay may fit your use case, and would like to learn more about it.

## Notes

Try to do an exercise with this. You may need to use an Azure VNet that emulates a corporate network in order to do so. Focus should be on hybrid connections as opposed to WCF, though you can mention WCF in the learning content for awareness.
