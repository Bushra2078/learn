With Azure Relay, you can publish services in your on-premises network to clients in the cloud, without lowering security.

Let's suppose you work for a financial organization that has a credit-checking web service. The service runs in an on-premises environment, but you need it to integrate with applications that run in the cloud. Regulations in your jurisdiction prevent you from moving this web service into Azure. However, you want to expose it securely, without the network complexity that typically goes with exposing services to the internet. You think that Azure Relay might fit your use case, and you want to learn more about it.

In this module, you'll create a connection through the Azure Relay service and then send requests through that relay.

By the end of this module, you'll identify situations where Azure Relay is helpful, and you'll implement connections between cloud and on-premises components.
