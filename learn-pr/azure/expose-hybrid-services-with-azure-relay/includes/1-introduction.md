With Azure Relay, you can publish services in your on-premises network to clients in the cloud, without lowering security.

Suppose you work for a financial organization that has a credit-checking web service. The service runs in an on-premises environment but you need it to integrate with applications that run in the cloud. Regulations in your jurisdiction mean that you're unable to move this web service into Azure, but you would like to expose it securely, without the network complexity that typically goes with exposing services to the internet. You think Azure Relay may fit your use case, and would like to learn more about it.

In this module, you will create a connection through the Azure Relay service and then send requests through that relay.

By the end of this module, you will be able to identify situations where Azure Relay is helpful and implement connections between cloud and on-premises components.
