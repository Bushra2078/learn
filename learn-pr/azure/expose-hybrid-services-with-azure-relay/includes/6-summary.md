Your financial organization needed to continue running its credit-checking web service on-premises for regulatory compliance, even though it has already migrated many systems into the cloud. You wanted to find a way to call this web service securely from cloud components, while avoiding the complexity of setting up and maintaining a virtual private network, or opening extra ports on the firewalls. By using an Azure Relay namespace, you provided a destination in Azure, where cloud components can call the service. The namespace forwards requests to the on-premises web service and returns responses.

You could use a virtual private network or Azure ExpressRoute to create secure connections between cloud-hosted components and on-premises systems. However, these methods impose an extra layer of complexity and more administrative load on your team. Azure Relay is an excellent alternative for connecting your applications.
