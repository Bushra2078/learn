## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    A financial company is moving an application to Azure that generates reports and data exports for users and other systems to consume. These reports and data exports are currently stored on both NAS devices and Windows file shares, so they can easily be shared between systems. They would like to consolidate the storage for these files to a native cloud service, while still leveraging SMB to access the files.
