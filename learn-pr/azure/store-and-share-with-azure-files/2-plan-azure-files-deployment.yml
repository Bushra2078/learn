      You've been asked by a local manufacturing company that runs dedicated software in their warehouse to keep track of stock. 
      The software needs to run on machines in the warehouse, but the management team wants to access the output from the head office. 
      The limited bandwidth available in the warehouse caused them problems in the past when they tried to use cloud-based solutions. 
      You recommend that they use Azure Files. Which is the best method to sync the files with the cloud?
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure Files share and directly mount shares on the machines in the warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer isn't the best because of the compute needs to run on-premises and there's low bandwidth."
    - content: "Use a machine in the warehouse to host a file share, install Azure File Sync, and share a drive with the rest of the warehouse."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is the best because the low bandwidth means Azure File Sync will handle the updating and syncing of files efficiently over the low-bandwidth network."
    - content: "Install Azure File Sync on every machine in the warehouse and head office."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't the recommended way to use Azure File Sync. You normally install it on a single machine, and the head office machines mount the file shares directly."

      The manufacturing company has a number of sensors that record time-relative data. Only the most recent data is useful. The company wants the lowest cost storage for this data.
      What is the best kind of storage account for them?
    choices:
    - content: "LRS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This option is the best because it's the lowest cost, the data is being continuously created, and data loss isn't an issue."
    - content: "GRS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option is good, but it would incur more cost than other options."
    - content: "ZRS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option is good, but it would incur more cost than other options."

      The manufacturing company's finance department wants to control how the data is being transferred to Azure Files. They want a graphical tool to manage the process, but they don't want to use the Azure portal.
      What tool do you recommend they use?
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Box"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This data transfer method isn't a GUI application."
    - content: "Robocopy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a command-line tool, not a GUI."
    - content: "Azure Storage Explorer "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This option is the best if the finance department doesn't want to use the Azure portal."
