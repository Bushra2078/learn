  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You've been asked by a local manufacturing company that runs dedicated software in their warehouse to keep track of stock. 
  The software needs to run on machines in the warehouse, but the management team would like to access the output from head office. 
  The limited bandwidth available in the warehouse has caused them problems in the past when trying cloud-based solutions. 
  You recommend that they use Azure File, which is the best method to sync the files with the cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure File Share and directly mount shares on the machines in the warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't the best answer due to the compute needing to run on-premises, and there's low bandwidth."
    - content: "Use a machine in the warehouse to host a file share, install Azure File Sync, and share a drive with rest of the warehouse."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the best answer as the low bandwidth means Azure File Sync will handle the updating and syncing of files efficiently over the low-bandwidth network."
    - content: "Install Azure File Sync on every machine in the warehouse and head office."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't the recommend way to use Azure File Sync. You would normally install it on a single machine, and the head office machines will mount the file shares directly."
  - content: "The manufacturing company has a number of sensors that record time relative data. Only the most recent data is useful. The company would like the lowest cost storage for this data.
    What is the best kind of storage account for them?"
    choices:
    - content: "LRS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the best option as it is the lowest cost, and the data is being continuously being created, data loss isn't an issue."
    - content: "GRS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a good option, but would incur more cost that other options."
    - content: "ZRS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a good option, but would incur more cost that other options."
  - content: "The manufacturing company's finance department would like to control how they data is being transferred to Azure Files. They'd like a graphical tool to manage the process, but they don't want to use the Azure portal.
  What tool should you recommend they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Box"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This data transfer method isn't a GUI application."
    - content: "Robocopy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a command-line tool, not a GUI."
    - content: "Azure Storage Explorer "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the best option if the finance department doesn't want to use the Azure portal."
