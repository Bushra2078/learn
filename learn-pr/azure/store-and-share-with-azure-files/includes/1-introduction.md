Azure Files provides a cloud-based file share for storing and sharing files. You can then access these files from applications hosted in Azure App Service, an Azure VM, or an on-premises app. Azure Files can store and share file access between applications and systems in a secure and failure resilient manner.

A financial company is moving an application to Azure that generates reports and data exports for users and other systems to consume. The company stores these reports and data exports on both NAS devices and Windows file shares. The files are stored this way so they can easily be shared between systems. They would like to consolidate the storage of these files to a native cloud service, as the company wants to continue to use SMB to access the files securely.

This module allows you to explore the File Share options available. You'll complete hands-on exercises to move data into a storage account, and then see how to use Azure Files to create secure SMB shares to access them.

By the end of this module, you'll know what features of Azure Files are available. You'll have created storage accounts, migrated data to them, and secured those files. Finally, you'll see how you can take snapshots of files, and use those snapshots on your Windows machine.
