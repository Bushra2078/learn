Packaging an app in a Docker image gives you a convenient way to deploy and run the app. You can automate the process of building a Docker image by defining the steps in a Dockerfile. Once you've created an image, you can upload it to a registry such as the Azure Container Registry. From there, you can create a container instance that runs the application.
