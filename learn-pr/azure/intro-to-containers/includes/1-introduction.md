Imagine you're a Python developer on an archeological research team. You're building machine learning models to help your team classify fossil data. As you develop each experiment, you start with a small data set on your laptop and then run the full experiment in the cloud on virtual machines (VMs). You find that you're spending more time bringing up and configuring VMs and less time writing doing what matters &mdash; bringing insights to your team.

That's where containers can help. Containers are a modern way to develop and run your applications.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Host a web server running on a Docker container
- Practice common ways to run, list, and delete containers
- Create your own container image and publish that image to Docker Hub
