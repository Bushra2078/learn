With some basic container skills under your belt, you're ready to explore your own ideas. You can run Docker containers built by others, build your own Docker images, and share your work with the community or just your team.

Other than the sandbox environment you used to explore how containers work, notice you have not yet used any of the Azure services that enable you to run containers in production.

That's a really positive thing about containers &mdash; they enable you to develop and test your code in your local environment before you deploy to the cloud. Once your app or service does what you expect in your local environment, you can run your containers on Azure. Because a container provides an isolated environment for your app, it'll run the same in the cloud as it does when you run it locally.
