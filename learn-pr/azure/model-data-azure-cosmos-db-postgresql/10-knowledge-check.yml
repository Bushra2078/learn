quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "There is a distributed table to track the events. Suppose the app users want to categorize the events, and a small list of categories will be provided. What type of table would be used for these categories?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reference table"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The categories table would be similar to the event_types and payment_merchants tables in this module."
    - content: "Distributed table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. A distributed table is meant for larger amounts of data."
    - content: "Local table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. A local table lives on the coordinator node and is not meant to be joined in queries with reference or distributed tables."
  - content: "Which of these scenarios is incompatible for foreign keys in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "From reference tables to distributed tables"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In order for foreign keys to be enforced, the referencing and referenced rows need to be stored on the same node. Going from a reference table to a distributed table that spans multiple nodes is not supported."
    - content: "Between reference tables and local tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL does support enforcing foreign keys between reference tables and local tables."
    - content: "From a distributed table to a reference table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL does support enforcing foreign keys starting a distributed table and going to a reference table. The data integrity is enforceable since each worker node has its own copy of a reference table."
  - content: "The Woodgrove Bank developers added a payment_categories table. Which command will show the table and its distribution details?"
    choices:
    - content: "SELECT * FROM citus_tables;"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The citus_tables query displays the table type, the distribution column, as well as the colocation id."
    - content: "\dt"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. \dt lists all tables in the database. It does not include distribution information."
    - content: "\d payment_categories"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. \d lists the table's schema information. It does not include distribution information."
