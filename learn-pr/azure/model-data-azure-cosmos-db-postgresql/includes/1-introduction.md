Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL provides a highly scalable distributed database solution by grouping multiple PostgreSQL servers as [nodes within a cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/hyperscale/concepts-nodes#coordinator-and-workers). As tech lead at Woodgrove Bank, you are helping their developers move their application from PostgreSQL to Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL. While the devs are used to working in a single relational database environment, they are not familiar with working in a distributed environment. When going into modeling, it is important they understand the building blocks they have to work with in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL - local tables, reference tables, and distributed tables. They also will need to consider data usage, data distribution, and data relationships.

## Scenario: Scaling Woodgrove Bank's Contactless Payment App

![Screenshot of Woodgrove Bank's logo - an icon of a factory with the words 'Woodgrove Bank' to the right of it.](../media/woodgrove-bank-logo.png)

Woodgrove Bank has a contactless payment app that works from six feet away, and the data is stored in a single, on-premises PostgreSQL database. After going through a successful trial of the app, Woodgrove Bank would like to release the app to customers across Europe and the United States. As the app needs to scale, the data will need to scale as well. Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL is built to host PostgreSQL databases and support them at scale. The Woodgrove Bank development team is unfamiliar with a distributed environment, and as their tech lead, you have the most experience to lead them in this growth.

In this module, you will help the developers take their first steps in moving to a distributed data environment. You will start by looking at how Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL processes a query at a high level and what it means to scale. You will look at the three common table types as well as how those table types work with existing relationships in a PostgreSQL database. Once you are aware of those tables, you will talk through design considerations using Woodgrove Bank's already proven relational model and how it changes in the distributed environment. The devs will have questions along the way, and you will have the tools to talk through modeling and altering configuration as needed.

By the end of this module, you will be able to determine which type of table to use for data and how to distribute the data effectively.
