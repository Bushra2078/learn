Working with the Woodgrove Bank developers on getting their application's database scaffolded, this diagram illustrates what they loaded in the database:

:::image type="content" source="../media/normalized-database-entity-relationship-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram of the relationships between users, events, merchants, and event types. payment_events' event_type field is now event_type_id, with a foreign key relationship to a new table named event_types. The event_types table contains the name and event_type_id, with the event_type_id as its primary key. The payment_events table also has a foreign key relationship to a new table named payment_merchants. The payment_merchants table has merchant_id, name, and url. The merchant_id is the primary key for payment_merchants.":::

In this exercise, you'll restructure their database to get to the following output:

:::image type="content" source="../media/distributed-entity-relationship-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram of distributed relationships between users, events, event types, and merchants. payment_events has a column event_type_id, with a foreign key relationship to the event_types table. The event_types table contains the name and event_type_id, with the event_type_id as its primary key. The event_types table is a reference table. The payment_merchants table has merchant_id, name, and url. The merchant_id is the distribution column for payment_merchants. The payment_users distributed table uses user_id as its distribution column and has a foreign key relationship to the payment_events table.":::

## Reset the exercise database

1. Clear the tables from the previous exercise, removing dependencies first:

    ```sql
        DROP TABLE payment_events;
        DROP TABLE payment_merchants;    
        DROP TABLE payment_users;
        DROP TABLE event_types;
    ```

1. Create the tables as the Woodgrove Bank developers created.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE event_types 
    (
        event_type_id bigint CONSTRAINT event_types_pk PRIMARY KEY,
        event_type text
    );

    CREATE TABLE payment_users
    (
        user_id bigint CONSTRAINT payment_users_pk PRIMARY KEY,
        url text,
        login text,
        avatar_url text
    );

    CREATE TABLE payment_merchants
    (
        merchant_id bigint CONSTRAINT payment_merchants_pk PRIMARY KEY,
        name text,
        url text
    );

    CREATE TABLE payment_events
    (
        event_id bigint,
        user_id bigint CONSTRAINT payment_events_payment_users_fk REFERENCES payment_users (user_id),
        event_type_id bigint CONSTRAINT payment_events_event_types_fk REFERENCES event_types (event_type_id),
        merchant_id bigint CONSTRAINT payment_events_payment_merchants_fk REFERENCES payment_merchants (merchant_id),
        event_details jsonb,
        created_at timestamp
    ) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);    
    ```

## Adjust the dependencies

In order to get the relational database ready for distribution, some constraints need to be removed.

```sql
ALTER TABLE payment_events         
    DROP CONSTRAINT payment_events_payment_merchants_fk;
ALTER TABLE payment_events         
    DROP CONSTRAINT payment_events_payment_users_fk;
```

## Distribute the non-events tables

The non-events tables can be distributed or turned into reference tables. As the Woodgrove Bank developers wonder what happens if `payment_merchants` is distributed, these steps will take you down that path.

1. Change `event_types` to a reference table with this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT create_reference_table('event_types');
    ```

1. Distribute `payment_users` on `user_id` with this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT create_distributed_table('payment_users','user_id');
    ```

1. Distribute `payment_merchants` on `merchant_id` with this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT create_distributed_table('payment_merchants','merchant_id');
    ```

1. Ensure the tables are distributed as expected with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT table_name, citus_table_type, distribution_column, colocation_id FROM citus_tables;
    ```

    Notice that the distributed tables are implicitly colocated together. Here's an example of the output:

    ```output
        table_name     | citus_table_type | distribution_column | colocation_id 
    -------------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------
    event_types       | reference        | <none>              |             2
    payment_merchants | distributed      | merchant_id         |             1
    payment_users     | distributed      | user_id             |             1
    ```            

## Update colocation settings

The developers asked about updating colocation after a table is distributed, as `payment_merchants` shouldn't be colocated. 

1. Run the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT update_distributed_table_colocation('payment_merchants',colocate_with=>'none');
    ```

1. Ensure that the users and merchants tables are no longer colocated with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT table_name, citus_table_type, distribution_column, colocation_id FROM citus_tables;  
    ```

    The users and merchants tables should have different `colocation_id` values. The output may look like this:

    ```output
        table_name     | citus_table_type | distribution_column | colocation_id 
    -------------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------
    event_types       | reference        | <none>              |             2
    payment_merchants | distributed      | merchant_id         |             4
    payment_users     | distributed      | user_id             |             1
    ```

## Distribute the events table

While you work through the design with the Woodgrove Bank developers, they asked why they shouldn't distribute the events on the `event_id` field.

1. Distribute the `payment_events` table on `event_id`.
    ```sql
    SELECT create_distributed_table('payment_events','event_id');
    ```

1. Query `citus_tables` to show co-location.
    ```sql
    SELECT table_name, citus_table_type, distribution_column, colocation_id FROM citus_tables;  
    ```

    The output will look like this:

    ```output
        table_name     | citus_table_type | distribution_column | colocation_id 
    -------------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------
    event_types       | reference        | <none>              |             2
    payment_events    | distributed      | event_id            |             1
    payment_merchants | distributed      | merchant_id         |             4
    payment_users     | distributed      | user_id             |             1
    ```
    
    Observe that Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL colocated `payment_events` with `payment_users` implicitly, based on datatypes of their distribution columns. The developers are starting to see that the fields don't match and that it doesn't seem like a good distribution column, as they want to join the `payment_events` and `payment_users` tables on `user_id`.

## Update the events table to distribute based on user_id

Update the `payment_events` table to be distributed on `user_id`.

1. Run the following query to change the distribution column for `payment_events`:

    ```sql
    SELECT alter_distributed_table('payment_events',distribution_column:='user_id');
    ```

    When this query is run successfully, you'll see output like this:

    ```output
    NOTICE:  creating a new table for public.payment_events
    NOTICE:  moving the data of public.payment_events
    NOTICE:  dropping the old public.payment_events
    NOTICE:  renaming the new table to public.payment_events
    ```

    This query will apply to all the partitions for this table.

1. Confirm the change took effect by running:

    ```sql
    SELECT table_name, citus_table_type, distribution_column, colocation_id FROM citus_tables;  
    ```

    The output is:

    ```output
        table_name     | citus_table_type | distribution_column | colocation_id 
    -------------------+------------------+---------------------+---------------
    event_types       | reference        | <none>              |             2
    payment_events    | distributed      | user_id             |             1
    payment_merchants | distributed      | merchant_id         |             4
    payment_users     | distributed      | user_id             |             1
    ```

    The `distribution_column` for `payment_events` and its partitions should show the `user_id`.

## Adding a foreign key to a distributed table after creation

In a case where there are two colocated distributed tables with a foreign key relationship, you'll need to add the foreign key after both tables are distributed. A foreign key in this case must include the distribution column.

1. `payment_events` should have a foreign key relationship to `payment_users`. Add this relationship with the following command:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE payment_events ADD CONSTRAINT events_users_fk
     FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES payment_users(user_id);
    ```

1. Confirm that the foreign key has been added by running the following command:

    ```sql
    \d payment_events
    ```

    The output will look like this:

    ```output
                      Partitioned table "public.payment_events"
    Column     |            Type             | Collation | Nullable | Default 
    ---------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
    event_id      | bigint                      |           |          | 
    user_id       | bigint                      |           |          | 
    event_type_id | bigint                      |           |          | 
    merchant_id   | bigint                      |           |          | 
    event_details | jsonb                       |           |          | 
    created_at    | timestamp without time zone |           |          | 
    Partition key: RANGE (created_at)
    Foreign-key constraints:
        "events_users_fk" FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES payment_users(user_id)
        "payment_events_event_types_fk" FOREIGN KEY (event_type_id) REFERENCES event_types(event_type_id)
    ```

    There should be two foreign keys on the `payment_events` table - one for the events and the other for the users.

## Adding a foreign key without the distribution column

`payment_events` also initially had a foreign key relationship with `payment_merchants`. Try adding this relationship with the following command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE payment_events ADD CONSTRAINT events_merchants_fk
 FOREIGN KEY (merchant_id) REFERENCES payment_merchants(merchant_id);
```

By running this command, you'll see output along these lines:

```output
ERROR:  cannot create foreign key constraint
DETAIL:  Foreign keys are supported in two cases, either in between two colocated tables including partition column in the same ordinal in the both tables or from distributed to reference tables
```

This foreign key is something that we'll have to sacrifice from the design when going from a single server to a distributed database.

## Convert from a distributed table to a reference table

The merchants table may not be as large as the developers suggested. Rather than having the foreign key relationship discarded, convert the merchant table to a reference table. Then, bring back the foreign key relationship from the distributed table to the reference table.

1. Convert the merchant table to a reference table with the following commands:

    ```sql
    SELECT undistribute_table('payment_merchants');
    SELECT create_reference_table('payment_merchants');
    ```

1. Add the foreign key relationship from payment_events to payment_merchants with the following command:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE payment_events ADD CONSTRAINT events_merchants_fk
     FOREIGN KEY (merchant_id) REFERENCES payment_merchants(merchant_id);
    ```

## View distributed tables

Confirm whether tables are distributed by querying the `citus_tables` system view. The following query includes the table name, table type, and distribution column. Run the following command:

```sql
SELECT table_name, citus_table_type, distribution_column FROM citus_tables;
```

In the results from the query, the `citus_table_type` column will indicate whether a table is a distributed table or a reference table. The results will look like this:

```bash
   table_name     | citus_table_type | distribution_column 
-------------------+------------------+---------------------
 event_types       | reference        | <none>
 payment_events    | distributed      | user_id
 payment_merchants | reference        | <none>
 payment_users     | distributed      | user_id
```

Notice that reference tables don't have distribution columns.
