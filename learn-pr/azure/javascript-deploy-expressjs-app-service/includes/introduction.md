In this Learn module, you'll deploy an Express.js (Node.js) app to Azure App Service from Visual Studio Code.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a web developer or DevOps engineer who needs to deploy a web app to Azure. You're an experienced developer, but you're new to Azure.

You'll learn how to deploy and configure the Azure resources you need to securely deploy a web app. The web app is a rental property app used by a company to help its employees relocate when needed. The app displays properties, images of the properties, and property information.

:::image type="content" source="../media/rental-app-website-browser.png" alt-text="Web browser that shows the main listings of a rental app.":::

The rental property web app is built with Express.js. The user interface is created with simple JavaScript and served from the Express.js server. The web app uses fake data stored in a JSON file. The data is read in at runtime and kept in memory. The images are randomly generated.

The entire source code is provided as part of this module. You won't be required to change the code.

## What will you be doing?

You'll deploy an Express.js app to Azure App Service and:

- Use the free Learn sandbox subscription and resource group.
- Create and configure App Service for an Express.js app.
- Deploy the web app from your local computer.
- View the cloud-based files from your local computer.
- Analyze web logs.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to deploy an Express.js app on your own App Service resource and know that it's running as expected.
