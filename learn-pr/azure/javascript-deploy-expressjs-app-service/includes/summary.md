In this Learn module, you deployed an Express.js (Node.js) app to Azure App Service from Visual Studio Code.

You played the role of an experienced developer who was new to Azure. You learned how to deploy and configure the Azure resources needed to securely deploy the web app. In this module, you:

- Used the free Learn sandbox subscription and resource group.
- Created and configured the Azure App Service for an Express.js app.
- Deployed the web app from your local computer.
- Viewed the cloud-based files from your local computer.
- Analyzed web logs.

You used Visual Studio Code and the Azure portal to create, deploy, and analyze your web app. Now, you can bring your own Express.js app to App Service.
