<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly summarize the key skill this unit will teach

    Heading: do not add an H1 or H2 title here, an auto-generated H1 will appear above this content

    Example: "Organizations often have multiple storage accounts to let them implement different sets of requirements."

-->
Azure Functions provide an easy, scalable way to deploy serverless APIs.

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that will be solved by the content in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "In the shoe-company scenario, we will use a Twitter trigger to launch our app when tweets containing our product name are available."
-->

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what's covered in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will learn the policy factors that are controlled by a storage account so you can decide how many accounts you need."
-->
Here, you will learn more about Azure Functions and the various capabilities relating to the bus-catching scenario. You'll also learn how Azure Functions have easy integrations with other services, like Azure SQL Database and Azure Logic Apps, that will help in building out the final solution.


<!-- 5. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to perform this sub-task.

    Structure: Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. 1-3 paragraphs of text
        3. A visual like an image, table, or list

## Catching the bus with serverless APIs

Recall the bus-catching scenario TODO: briefly explain the scenario and why serverless APIs are required. Extrapolate to how this is also required for the development of most apps.

## Azure Functions

Overview of Azure Functions

### Integrating with Azure SQL Database

TODO

### Integrating with other services

TODO but include Logic Apps and other possibilities
