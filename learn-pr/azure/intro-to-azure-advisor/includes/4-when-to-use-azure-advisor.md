Azure Advisor takes the ownership of optimizing your Azure deployments in three approaches:

* Provide highly personalized recommendations and best practices, which are both actionable and proactive;
* Help you find ways to reduce costs related to your Azure service subscriptions; and
* Improve the security, reliability, operational excellence, and performance of resources you use.

The usage of Azure Advisor doesn't have costs, it's free. Carefully consider about apply or not those recommendations that make sense in your environment, but definitively is something you should use in all your Azure subscriptions.
