## Level

intermediate

## Product(s)

- azure-active-directory-b2c
- msal-node

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an [active subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- Familiarity with identity concepts such as authentication, security tokens and OpenID Connect protocol at beginner level.

- Ability to navigate the Azure portal such as searching resources and switching between directories.

## Summary

Create a Node web app and configure it to authenticate users. When users sign in, the web app delegates the authentication task to the customer identity service.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

1. Prepare Azure AD B2C to authenticate users in a web app.

1. Configure authentication in a Node web app by using Azure AD B2C.

1. Run and test the Node web app.

## Outline the units

1. Introduction

    Suppose you're the solution architect for an eCommerce organization. Your organization is launching a new Node web app, which enables customers to order groceries online. Your organization requires that the web app authenticates customers for them to make an order, so they can sign up or sign in to the web app using their email or a social account. Because of customer data sensitivity and authentication scaling complexities, your organization doesn't want to manage customer identities from within the Node web app. So, your organization wants to use Azure AD B2C as an identity provider because you can customize the entire user experience with your brand. You want to start by authenticating users to the Node web app by using Azure AD B2C.

    1. msal-node instance.
    1. How msal-node implements the two steps in OAuth2.0's Authorization Code flow.
    1. Get authorization Code URL by using `getAuthCodeUrl` method - OAuth2.0's Authorization Code flow's step 1.
    1. Acquire `idToken` by exchanging the Authorization Code received by using `acquireTokenByCode` method- OAuth2.0's Authorization Code flow's step 2.
    1. Sign user out of Node web app by sending sign out request to Azure AD B2C' logout URI.

    1. Why is it advisable to use Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to configure authentication in a web app?
    1. What is the result of a request sent by a web app to Azure AD B2C?

1. Summary

Your organization was launching an online grocery store. Your organization needed customers to be authenticated in a web app before they could make an order. Instead of managing customer identities from within the web app, which is a challenge, and wouldn't scale well, your organization needed to use an identity management solution.

Azure AD B2C helped your organization to authenticate users into your web app. We used Azure AD B2C's user flows to manage a users sign up and sign in journeys. Your Node web app redirected the user to Azure AD B2C where user authentication occurred and only received a response from Azure AD B2C as an ID token and token claims for user identification.

If your organization didn't use Azure AD B2C, you'd have to build a whole authentication module from scratch, model a user's data schema, and store the data yourself. Because users can also use social identities, you'd perform the integration yourself. Besides, you'd have to deal with scaling and safety of the authentication platform.

By using Azure AD B2C and with the help of msal-node library, you added an authentication module to your web app quickly with few lines of code. Also, Azure AD B2C handles scaling and safety out of the box.
