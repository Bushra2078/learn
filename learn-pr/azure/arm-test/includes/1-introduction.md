Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) uses things like parameters, variables, functions and more to create the templates. These constructs allows you to save time, as you don't need to create a new template per environment, among other things.

You are the person on a software team authoring these templates. You plan to deploy the described infrastructure in the templates. As you author these templates you care about having a fast feedback loop so that any errors, or violations against best practices, can be pointed out to you prior to deployment. You decide to evaluate the existing tools that could help you while authoring.

In this module, you gain an understanding to what practices it's beneficial to follow and why it's important. You also practice using the Testing toolkit to correct issues on your templates, so it conforms to the best practices.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:
- Evaluate the What-if operation so can preview the changes that will happen as you deploy your templates. 
- Use the ARM Template Test Toolkit to check templates for standards
- Create a custom test for an ARM Template
