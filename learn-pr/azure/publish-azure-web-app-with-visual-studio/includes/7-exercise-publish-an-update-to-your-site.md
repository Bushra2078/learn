Your Alpine Ski House web app is up and running, but now you need to show it to your boss. You are going to have to update the site and publish those updates to Azure.

## Update your web app

### Replace the boilerplate code

1. In the **Pages** folder, open the **About.cshtml** file.

1. At the bottom of the code, locate 
    `<p> Use this area to provide additional information. </p>`.

1. Replace this boilerplate text with
    `<p>Welcome to the Alpine Ski House!</p>`.

1. Save the file.

1. Open the **Index.cshtml** file.

1. Replace the content within the `<p>` tags to say
    **Alpine Ski House is the premier ski hill in Northeast!**

1. Save the file.

### Publish your updates

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project.

1. Select **Publish...**. This should open a new tab named **AplineSkiHouse**.

1. Select the **Publish** button to deploy the latest changes.

### View your changes

Once you've published your changes, Visual Studio will open the site in your browser. You should now see your new message on the home page.

Congratulations, you have successfully updated your web app from within Visual Studio 2019.
