  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Your organization needs to be able to store secrets and also draw insights on how and when these secrets are accessed over time. Which Azure services could you use together to help you achieve this?
    choices:
      - content: Use Azure Key Vault with Azure Disk Encryption.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation:  Azure Disk Encryption is used to encrypt OS and data disk of your virtual machines in Azure. It is not used to audit who has accessed secrets over time.
      - content: Use Azure Key Vault with Azure Monitor.
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: You can use Azure Key Vault with Azure Monitor and draw insights from Key Vault AuditEvent logs. 
      - content: Use Azure Key Vault with client-side encryption.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Client-side encryption is not used to audit who has accessed secrets over time. Client-side encryption is used to encrypt data through a client application before it is stored in Azure. 
  - content: You need to add a password to an Azure Key Vault that holds a few other passwords. What is the command you need to use to add another password?
    choices:
      - content: Use the "az keyvault create" command.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: You would use this to create a key vault if one does not exist, not to add a secret to one that already exists.
      - content: Use the "az keyvault password set" command.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: An "az key vault password set" command does not exist. 
      - content: Use the "az keyvault secret set" command.
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: This command will let you add a secret or update one.
