# Module Design

## Title

Secure your data at rest with encryption on Azure

## Role(s)

- Solution architect
- Developer

## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage
- Azure PaaS services
- Client-side encryption
- Storage service encryption

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of SSL/TLS encryption
- Basic knowledge of Azure PaaS services

## Summary

Identify the data used in your organization and ensure it's stored securely on Azure. Store secrets securely, and leverage client-side and storage service encryption to protect your data.

## Learning objectives

- Identify the types of data your organization is using and the security requirements surrounding that data
- Identify the encryption capabilities for services on Azure

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Secure your data at rest with encryption on Azure*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- |---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    A manufacturing organization is moving several systems to Azure. They are storing a variety of data within these systems, such as customer details, financial information, and intellectual property. They need to properly identify and classify this data, to ensure they secure it to meet business and regulatory requirements. Once this data is classified, they need to select the proper encryption method and/or service to protect this data.

2. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

3. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

4. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    2. Step
    3. Step

5. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

This module may be limited on interactivity, as it's more of a tour of the encryption capabilities on Azure, and properly classifying data. If a good hands on exercise is identified though, we can look at incorporating it.
