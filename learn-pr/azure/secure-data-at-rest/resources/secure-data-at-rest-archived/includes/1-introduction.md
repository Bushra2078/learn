Data encryption is a fundamental consideration of data security, helping organizations face the challenges of protecting customers' privacy and their reputation. In the digital age protecting against data loss in cloud applications can seem complicated, but data encryption isn't something your organization has to solve on its own.

Suppose you work for a manufacturing company that is moving several systems to Azure. Your company currently stores different kinds of data within these systems including customer details, financial information, and intellectual property. To work towards meeting regulatory and business requirements you need to ensure you store data securely, the first steps are to correctly identify and then classify your data. Once data is classified, you'll then need to select the appropriate encryption method or service to protect the data.

Your security policies mandate any data you store data must be encrypted. The information security team have also requested you undertake a data classification process, as they don't currently have time to help.

In this module, you'll look at how to discover, classify, and mask data using Azure SQL Database. You'll then explore the data encryption-at-rest capabilities for key data services in Azure.
