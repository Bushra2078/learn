  questions:

  - content: 'What is the prime consideration for encrypting data at rest on Azure?'
    choices:
    - content: Data is now stored in the cloud 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Data encryption applies whether data is stored on-premises or in the cloud.
    - content: To prevent a data breach
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Encrypting data at rest will not prevent a data breach or attack on its own.
    - content: To protect sensitive data once stored in a service
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The purpose for encrypting stored data is to provide a further protective layer in the the event of data loss to an attacker.
    - content: To restrict access to Azure services
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Encrypting data at rest does not restrict access to Azure services.

  - content: 'Why does Azure not decrypt data when using the client-side encryption model?'
    choices:
    - content: Encryption happens outside of Azure.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Encryption keys are typically stored outside of Azure but most importantly the encryption happens before being received by Azure.
    - content: Encryption keys are customer-controlled 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure supports encrypted keys controlled by a customer.
    - content: Azure does not support client-side encryption 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure does provide support for the client-side encryption model.
    - content: Azure does not decrypt stored data
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure resource providers perform decryption of data, although it will be transparent to a user.

  - content: 'How are keys invoked in Azure Key Vault?'
    choices:
    - content: Keys are retrieved automatically with no user intervention 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Keys are not retrieved automatically an application or service has to request them.
    - content: Keys can be retrieved by entering the master secret for the vault
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There is no master secret for an Azure Key Vault.
    - content: Keys are retrieved by invoking the Key Vault URI
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure Key Vault is automatically linked with the Azure AD tenant of the subscription upon creation. Access is then granted either through User plus application access or Application-only access. Either method requires a token for a resource to grant access, this token in combination with the vault URI can be used to make a REST API request to the Key Vault.
    - content: Keys are retrieved by visiting the Key Vault service through the portal
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Invoking of keys is a programmatic term not a manual user process.

  - content: 'What Azure services have encryption at rest enabled by default?'
    choices:
    - content: Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Azure Cosmos DB
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure SQL Data Warehouse does not have at rest encryption enabled by default.
    - content: Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database and Azure Cosmos DB
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: At present, not all services have encryption enabled by default. This is vitally important to remember if you you plan to store sensitive data or your organizations security policies state all data stored must be encrypted.
    - content: Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Machines Data Disks, Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure virtual machine data disks do not encrypt data at rest by default.
    - content: Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse and Azure Cosmos DB
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure SQL Data Warehouse does not provide at rest encryption by default.
