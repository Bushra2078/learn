  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Your organization is using Azure SQL Database as the database for an application being developed. They're using Azure Key Vault to hold all of their secrets. The application is interacting with the SQL Database through a connection string. A developer is currently updating the application with some new code. The developer has accidentally copied a chunk of the application's code into a chat log with an external partner organization. What has happened with the connection string?
    choices:
      - content: The connection string has been exposed, and the external organization can see the connection string.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation:  The connection string hasn't been exposed. The source code won't show the connection string, because it's kept secure by Azure Key Vault.
      - content: The connection string hasn't been exposed – it isn't visible in the application.
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: The connection string hasn't been exposed because the connection string is kept secure by Azure Key Vault. The application doesn't have a copy of the connection string.
      - content: The connection string hasn't been exposed – it's been automatically deleted.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: The connection string hasn't been exposed, and isn't automatically deleted.
  - content: You have an application that your organization wants you to secure using Azure. The application has usernames, passwords, and some encryption keys included inside the code. The application has data stored on a local server. How would you secure your application and data?
    choices: 
    - content: Move the application's data into Azure Storage Service, then move the secrets into Azure Key Vault.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You should move all of the secrets into Azure Key Vault, and move the data into Azure Storage for secure encryption.
    - content: Move the application's data into Azure Storage Service, and leave the secrets on the on-premises server.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Don't leave the secrets on the on-premises server. Your data may be secure, but your secrets aren't.
    - content: Move only the application into Azure Security Service, then move the secrets into Azure Key Vault.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can't move an application into Azure Security Service as it doesn't host any applications. Azure Security Service points to applications and monitors them for threats and risks. Also, your data is still at risk because it's still on-premises.
