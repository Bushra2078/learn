  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: You've created a new Azure SQL DB. How would you enable encryption at rest for your SQL DB?
    choices: 
    - content: Go to the portal, find the SQL DB transparent data encryption setting, and turn it on.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While this would help you enable TDE, you don't need to do this, because you're dealing with a newly created SQL DB. Only older SQL DBs need you to enable TDE.
    - content: Use PowerShell to work with the SQL DB, and use it to enable transparent data encryption.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While this would help you enable TDE, you don't need to do this because you're dealing with a newly created SQL DB. Only older SQL DBs need you to enable TDE.
    - content: The SQL DB already has encryption enabled â€“ there's nothing to be done.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Newly created SQL DBs automatically have TDE enabled.
  - content: Keys are used to encrypt your Cosmos DB data. What must you do with these keys to protect the data?
    choices:
    - content: You must copy these keys. The keys can then always be used again to protect the data.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't access the keys yourself. Keys are managed for you automatically in Azure. 
    - content: You don't have to do anything. The keys are rotated automatically to protect your data.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Cosmos DB automatically rotates the keys in the background to protect your data.
    - content: You must rotate the keys. The keys need to be changed periodically to protect the data. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't have to do anything. The keys are rotated automatically for you.
