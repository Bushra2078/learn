      explanation: An application like this would deal with the unstructured data and help draw insights from all of the information that's being generated at a high speed.
    - content: Propose and develop an application that's designed to analyze structured data with high velocity.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: It's generally a better idea for data to be in an unstructured format if it's flowing fast and is flexible. You'd be dealing with massive amounts of flexible data coming at a fast pace.
    - content: Propose and develop an application that's designed to analyze structured data to avoid high velocity.
      isCorrect:  false
      explanation: There's no need to avoid the high velocity of the data. An application designed to work with unstructured data could handle this situation. It's generally better for the data to be in an unstructured format if the data is flowing fast and is flexible. You'd be dealing with massive amounts of data coming at a fast pace.
