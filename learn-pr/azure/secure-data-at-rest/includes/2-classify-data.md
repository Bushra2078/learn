Your organization has several different systems, with data such as customer details, financial information, and more. In order to be in a position to protect the data, you need to understand the data better by classifying the different types of data you are dealing with, understanding the different states data can be in, and the different ways in which data can be structured.

 Here, you'll learn the different states of data, learn about the classifications of confidential, internal, or public data, and differentiate structured vs unstructured data.

## Data states

All data can be in different states at different moments in time. At the most basic level, data can be in use, in transit, or at rest (settled and stored somewhere).

- **Data at rest** can include storage objects and files that are on physical media. The media can be optical disks or magnetic disks such as HDDs.
- **Data in transit** is data being moved, whether over a network, or transferred between two locations or applications and programs.
- **Data in use** is data that is presently being processed, updated, generated, or accessed in some way.

A typical piece of data may go through all states throughout its lifecycle.

Data states and classifications are linked. You will not be able to meet classification requirements for your data if you don't understand what its different states are, and plan accordingly. If you can understand the different states that your data is going to be in throughout its lifecycle, together with what its classification is throughout all of its different states, you can put together solutions tailored to better protect your data and meet regulatory and business requirements. Consider encrypting your data regardless of its state, unless the data is classified as explicitly not to be encrypted.

## Data classification

Data can be categorized into different levels of classifications. When data is classified in one of these levels, it has to adhere to this classification, whatever its current state. For example, when data is classified as highly confidential, it's expected to stick to this level of classification – whether it's in process, in transit or at rest.

Classification is based on the importance of the data to the business and its stakeholders. All data has some level of impact. This impact can be financial, legal, or reputational. Customer data can be leaked, or a company's internal data might have been distributed online for all to access. The impact on the organization and its customers can be devastating. That's the reason why data is classified by its expected impact on the business and stakeholders.

The terms used can vary between organizations but they generally fall into the following general levels: high, medium, and low. For example, an organization might have these three classifications:

- **Confidential (high level)**: If this data is exposed or lost, it would substantially impact the organization or the concerned individual, whether they're a customer or an employee. Some examples of the type of data that could be classified with this level are:

  - Personal data such as name and address.
  - Financial data such as account balances, deposits.
  - Code or intellectual property belonging to an organization.
  - Passwords, user/application credentials, cryptographic keys, and certificates.
  
- **Internal use only (medium level)**: Information that should only be viewed internally, and must not be shared with anyone external to the organization. Some examples of the type of data that could be classified with this level are:

  - Emails that can be deleted or distributed without a severe impact.
  - Files that don't include any confidential data.

  Unless classified explicitly as confidential, or for public consumption, you should consider all data in an organization to be, at a minimum, classified at this medium level.

- **Public (low level)**: This data can be shown publicly outside of the organization. Often, this is data that must be deliberately shared to the outside world for business purposes. Some examples of the type of data that could be classified with this level are

  - API documentation for a product or service the organization offers to customers.
  - A new public website showcasing a new solution.
  - A public interview to make an announcement concerning a new strategy.

## Structured and unstructured data

Generally, you can categorize data into either structured or unstructured. Structured data can be data that resides in a spreadsheet or a relational database. This type of data is in a fixed field that is part of a larger record. Think about a spreadsheet showing employee details. You'd have columns for details about each employee – for example, employee ID, their role, and their salary. Here's an example showing what that type of structured data could look like:

| Employee ID | Role     | Salary  |
| ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| 12345       | Cashier  | $25,102 |
| 67890       | Cashier  | $25,102 |
| 10123       | Security | $25,301 |

Unstructured data can be such things as images, videos, and files such as word processor documents. This type of data is not captured in conventional predefined fixed fields. For example, in PDF application, the source data for a PDF document would be in an unstructured format. The application would present the data in a meaningful way. In another example, streaming video data of live streamers is unstructured in its raw form, but presented in a meaningful way for viewers.

All data must be managed and classified based on its impact on the organization and its stakeholders, regardless of whether it's in a structured or unstructured format.
