Azure provides a range of tools and services to help secure stored data. 

You've been hired as a lead cloud architect for a manufacturing organization. The organization is moving several systems to Azure. Different kinds of data are stored in these systems â€“ such as customer details, financial information, and intellectual property.  You need to correctly identify and classify this data, to secure it to meet business and regulatory requirements. After this data is classified, you need to select the proper encryption method and/or service to protect it.

In this module, you'll learn how to classify your data, then identify the security requirements relevant to each type of data. Finally, you'll look at the Azure tools and encryption options that can be used to protect your stored "at rest" data.

## Learning objectives

- Identify the types of data your organization is using and the security requirements surrounding that data.
- Identify the encryption capabilities for services on Azure.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of SSL/TLS encryption.
- Basic knowledge of Azure PaaS services.
