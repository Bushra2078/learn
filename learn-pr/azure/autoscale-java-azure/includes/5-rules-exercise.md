In this exercise, we look at exercises for setting up and triggering autoscaling of your sample application.

To test the autoscale rules, we will generate some load on the instances. This simulated load causes the autoscale rules to scale out and increase the number of instances. As the simulated load is then decreased, the autoscale rules scale in and reduce the number of instances.

In your sample application, we've already setup autoscale to trigger on the customer service microservice when the tomcat request count exceeds five sessions per minute on average.

After the autoscale is triggered, it will then scale down if the request count is less than, or equal to 5.
In the next exercises, you'll trigger autoscaling via Azure Application Insights, via a script and finally, manually via a web browser.

## Trigger out the scale-out action with Application insights

To trigger the auto scale, we will need to generate some load to get the average tomcat request count above five.
Create an Application Insights instance from the Azure portal and select performance testing under the configure menu.
Select "new" and choose "manual test" under test type.
Copy and paste the below public endpoint of the gateway app, and replace the service name with the name of your spring cloud instance and select "run test".

```bash
https://<your-spring-cloud-service>-api-gateway.azuremicroservices.io/api/customer/owners
```

After the load test is complete, letâ€™s head back to Metrics under the Monitoring section of our Azure Spring Cloud instance. We see our average tomcat request count increase during the load test.

## Trigger the scale-out action with a script

```bash
sh loadTest.sh
```

## Navigate to the Autoscale page in the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the Azure portal
2. Go to the Azure Spring Cloud **Overview** page.
3. Select the resource group that contains your service.
4. Select the **Apps** tab under **Settings** in the menu on the left navigation pane.
5. Select the customers-service application. You should then see the application's **Overview** page.
6. Go to the **Scale out** tab under **Settings** in the menu on the left navigation pane.

## Viewing autoscale events

In the autoscale setting screen, go to the Run history tab to see the most recent scale actions. The tab also shows the change in Observed Capacity over time. To find more details about all autoscale actions including operations such as update/delete autoscale settings, view the activity log and filter by autoscale operations.

## Trigger the scale-out action manually via a web browser

To trigger the scale-out condition in the autoscale setting created, the Web App must have more than five requests in less than 1 minute.

1. Open a new browser window and navigate to the customer-service:

```bash
https://<your-spring-cloud-service>-api-gateway.azuremicroservices.io/api/customer/owners
```

1. In quick succession, reload the page more than 10 times.

1. Back in the original browser window, from the left-hand navigation pane, select the Monitor option. Once the page loads select the Autoscale tab.

1. From the list, select the App Service Plan used throughout this tutorial.

1. On the autoscale setting, select the Run history tab.

1. You see a chart reflecting the instance count of the App Service Plan over time.

1. In a few minutes, the instance count should rise from 1, to 2.

1. Under the chart, you see the activity log entries for each scale action taken by this autoscale setting.

## Trigger a scale-in action manually

The scale-in condition in the autoscale setting triggers if there are fewer than five requests to the Web App over a period of 10 minutes.

1. Ensure no requests are being sent to your Web App and the browser window to your app/service is closed.

1. Load the Azure portal.

1. From the left-hand navigation pane, select the Monitor option. Once the page loads select the Autoscale tab.

1. From the list, select the App Service Plan used throughout this tutorial.

1. On the autoscale setting, select the Run history tab.

1. You see a chart reflecting the instance count of the App Service Plan over time.

1. In a few minutes, the instance count should drop from 2, to 1. The process takes at least 5 minutes.

1. Under the chart, are the corresponding set of activity log entries for each scale action taken by this autoscale setting.
