The ObjectManipulator script makes an object movable, scalable, and rotatable using one or two hands. This script supports the direct manipulation input model as the script enables the user to touch holograms directly with their hands. Here you will create a cube and use ObjectManipulator to enable hand interactions so that you can scale and rotate the cube.

## Add a Cube to the scene

1. In the **Hierarchy** window, click the **+** icon and select **3D Object** > **Cube**.

1. In the **Inspector** window, change the Cube's **Transform Scale** to **.25**, **.25**, **.25**. This will make the cube smaller.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/cube_transform_scale.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inspector window with the Scale parameters highlighted. The value of x, y and z are 0.25.":::

1. Change the Cube **Transform Position** to **0**, **0**, **.8**. This will move the cube object further back on the z-axis. When you later import the Mixed Reality Toolkit into your project, this change will provide a better view of the cube in the **Game** window.

## Add a material to the Cube

1. In the **Project** window, enter **MRTK_Standard_Blue** into the search bar.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/search-mrtk-standard-blue.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project window with the search bar highlighted. The phrase m r t k underscore standard underscore blue is entered into the search bar.":::

1. Select the **MRTK_Standard_Blue** material and drag onto the Cube. This will change the color of the cube to blue.

## Add ObjectManipulator to the Cube

1. Select the **Cube** object in the **Hierarchy** window.
1. In the **Inspector** window, click **Add Component**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/cube-add-component.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inspector window with the Add Component button highlighted.":::

1. In the **Search** window that appears, enter **Object Manipulator**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/search-object-manipulator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inspector window with the search bar highlighted. The phrase Object Manipulator is entered into the search bar.":::

1. Select the **Object Manipulator** script. This script will enable you to manipulate the cube using your hands.

## Add NearInteractionGrabbable to the Cube

1. Select the **Cube** object in the **Hierarchy** window.
1. In the **Inspector** window, click **Add Component**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/cube-add-component.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inspector window with the Add Component button highlighted.":::

1. In the **Search** window that appears, enter **Near Interaction Grabbable**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/search-near-interaction-grabbable.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Inspector window with the search bar highlighted. The phrase Near Interaction Grabbable is entered into the search bar.":::

1. Select the **Near Interaction Grabbable** script. This script will enable you to grab the object from a close distance.

## Move the Cube in play mode

1. In the Unity toolbar, click the **Play** icon to enter play mode.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/play-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Unity editor in Play mode. The play button displays blue. A blue cube displays in the Scene and Game window. The diagnostics tools displays below the cube in both windows.":::

1. Using the Unity in-editor input simulation, press the **space bar** on your keyboard to simulate hand input with the right hand.

## Rotate the Cube in play mode

1. While in Play mode, press the **space bar** on your keyboard to simulate hand input with the right hand.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/hand-simulation.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of the Game window with the blue cube in the center and a right simulated hand to the right of the cube. The diagnostics tools displays below the cube.":::

1. While pressing the space bar, use your mouse scroll wheel to adjust the hand's distance to the cube. Left click the mouse to grab the cube.
1. While pressing the space bar, press the **CTRL** key on your keyboard and left click the mouse to rotate the hand.

## Scale the Cube in play mode

To scale an object, at least one hand needs to grab the object while the other is used to scale the object.

1. While in Play mode, press the **T** and **Y** keys on your keyboard to simulate hand input with both the left and right hands. The **T** and **Y** keys will make the hands persistent in the view.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/simulate-two-hands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Game window with the blue cube in the center. A left and right simulated hand are on top of the cube. The diagnostics tools displays below the cube.":::

1. Grab the cube with the right hand by first pressing the **space bar** on your keyboard and using the mouse scroll wheel to adjust the hand's distance to the cube. Left click the mouse to grab the cube.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/grab-right-hand.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Game window with the blue cube in the center. The right simulated hand is grabbing the right middle side of the cube. The left simulated hand is inactive on top of the cube. The diagnostics tools displays below the cube.":::

1. Grab the cube with the left hand by first pressing the **shift** key on your keyboard and using the mouse scroll wheel to adjust the hand's distance to the cube. Left click the mouse to grab the cube.
