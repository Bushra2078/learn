The Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) is a cross-platform toolkit for building Mixed Reality experiences for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). The toolkit provides a set of components and features which could be used to accelerate your Windows Mixed Reality development.

Suppose you are creating a mixed reality experience in which the user needs the ability to move, rotate and scale a holographic object. Although you could start from scratch and create your own script to enable such manipulations, your workflow of adding direct manipulation to holograms and configuring constraints may be time consuming -- especially if there are multiple objects to configure.

In this module, you will configure Unity for Windows Mixed Reality development and import the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) into your project. The Mixed Reality Toolkit includes a ObjectManipulator script which will be applied to a cube for direct manipulation with hands.

By the end of this module, you will be able to setup a Unity project configured for Windows Mixed Reality development and utilize the Mixed Reality Toolkit to accelerate your mixed reality development.
