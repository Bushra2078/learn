Azure doesn’t monitor for or respond to security incidents within the customer’s area of responsibility, as discussed in Module 2, “Implement platform protection.” Azure does provide many tools (such as Azure Security Center, Azure Sentinel) that are used for this purpose. There is also an effort to help make every service as secure as possible by default. That is, every service comes with a baseline that is already designed to help provide security for most common-use cases. However, because no way exists to predict how a service will be used, you need to review these security controls to evaluate whether they adequately mitigate risks.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn Azure platform security baselines and how they were created
- Create and validate a security baseline for the most commonly used Azure services
