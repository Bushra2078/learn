Microsoft's cybersecurity group, in conjunction with the Center for Internet Security ([CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/)), developed best practices to help establish security baselines for the Azure platform.

Microsoft initially partnered with CIS for the development of an off-the-shelf [hardened Azure VM](https://www.cisecurity.org/hardened-images/). An initiative then began to use the CIS Benchmarks (their term for best practices) with Azure security services and tools to facilitate security and compliance for customer applications running on Azure services.

> [!TIP]
> The [CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Security Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure/) guide provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure baseline configuration for Azure. This guide was tested against the listed Azure services as of March 2018. The scope of this benchmark is to establish the foundational level of security for anyone adopting Azure.

## Create a platform security baseline

A variety of security standards can help cloud service customers to achieve workload security when using cloud services. The following recommended technology groupings help create secure cloud-enabled workloads. These recommendations should not be considered as an exhaustive list of all possible security configurations and architectures; rather, as a starting point.

CIS has two implementation levels, and several categories of recommendations.

* **Level 1** - Recommended minimum security settings
    - These should be configured on all systems.
    - These should cause little or no interruption of services nor reduced functionality.
    
* **Level 2** - Recommendations for highly secure environments
    - These might result in reduced functionality.

The following table provides the categories and number of recommendations made for each.

| Technology group | Description | # of recommendations |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** | Recommendations related to IAM policies | 23 |
| **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** | Recommendations related to the configuration and use of Microsoft Defender for Cloud | 19 |
| **Storage accounts** | Recommendations for setting storage account policies | 7 |
| **Azure SQL Database** | Recommendations for helping secure Azure SQL databases | 8 |
| **Logging and monitoring** | Recommendations for setting logging and monitoring policies for your Azure subscriptions | 13 |
| **Networking** | Recommendations for helping to securely configure Azure networking settings and policies | 5 |
| **VMs** | Recommendations for setting security policies for Azure compute services - specifically VMs | 6 |
| **Other** | Recommendations regarding general security and operational controls, including those related to Azure Key Vault and resource locks | 3 |
| **Total recommended** | | 84 |

Let's explore each category in more detail.
