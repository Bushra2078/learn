  questions:
  - content: What is one of the major advantages of using Azure AD B2B collaboration?
    choices:
    - content: You can allow people outside of your organization to use their own credentials to sign in to your apps.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A B2B collaboration user authenticates using credentials from their home organization or identity provider, so you don't need to provide or maintain credentials for them.
    - content: You can collaborate with people outside of your organization by giving them a user ID and password.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. A B2B collaboration user authenticates using their own credentials and their home organization or identity provider. You don't need to maintain a user ID or password for them.
    - content: You can allow people outside of your organization to access your apps without adding a user object to your directory.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. A user object for the B2B collaboration user is added to your directory, and you can manage it like other user objects in your directory, for example by assigning permissions, adding it to groups, and so on.
  - content: How can you add an additional layer of protection to the application?
    choices:
    - content: Use unconditional access policies in Azure AD B2B.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. There's no such thing as unconditional access policies in Azure.
    - content: Use Conditional Access policies in Azure AD B2B.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Conditional Access policies offer further protection for your applications. You can ensure that your applications are only accessed when all conditions you set have been met.
    - content: Use criteria access policies in Azure AD B2B.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. There's no such thing as criteria access policies in Azure.
