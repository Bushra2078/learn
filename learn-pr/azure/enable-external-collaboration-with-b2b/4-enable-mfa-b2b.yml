quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What is one of the **External Collaboration settings** you should review to make sure B2B collaboration is enabled?
    choices:
    - content: Check your **Collaboration restrictions** to make sure that if **Deny invitations to the specified domains** is selected, the domains you want to invite are *not* in the list.
      isCorrect: True
      explanation: Correct. This setting will block B2B collaboration with any domain that's listed below it. If this setting is selected, you'll want to make sure the domain you want to collaborate with hasn't been added to the list.
    - content: Check your **Collaboration restrictions** to make sure **Enable global B2B collaboration** is selected.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. **Enable global B2B collaboration** isn't one of the available settings in Azure AD.
    - content: Check your **Guest invite settings** to make sure that **No one in the organization can invite guest users including admins (most restrictive)** is selected.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. This setting will block everyone in your organization, including admins, from sending B2B collaboration invitations to external users.
  - content: Which of the following are valid categories for multi-factor authentication?
    choices:
    - content: Something a user possesses, and something the user doesn't know.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. Something the user doesn't know isn't an available category.
    - content: Something a user knows, and something the user doesn't possess.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. Something the user doesn't possess isn't an available category.
    - content: Something a user possesses, and something a user knows.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Authentication can be dependent on something such as a user's device, or a phrase only known to the user.
  - content: What's a good way to double-check identities of B2B collaboration users before they access an application?
    choices:
    - content: Configure multi-factor authentication by sending an invitation to a recovery email address for the B2B collaboration user.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. You configure multi-factor authentication by creating a Conditional Access policy scoped to the application and to guest and external users.
    - content: Configure multi-factor authentication by creating a Conditional Access policy and assigning it to your application and all guest and external users.
      isCorrect: True
      explanation: Correct. You configure enforcement of multi-factor authentication by creating a Conditional Access policy in the Azure portal. The policy assignments should be your application and all guest and external users.
    - content: Configure multi-factor authentication by using the What if tool to create a policy for your application.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. The What if tool in the Azure portal is a useful way to test your policy after you've configured it.
