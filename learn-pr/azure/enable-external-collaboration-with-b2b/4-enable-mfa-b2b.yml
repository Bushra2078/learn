quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What is one of the External Collaboration settings you should review to make sure B2B collaboration is enabled?
    choices:
    - content: Check your Collaboration restrictions to make sure **Enable global B2B collaboration** is selected.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. This isn't one of the available settings in Azure AD.
    - content: Check your Guest invite settings to make sure that **No one in the organization can invite guest users including admins** is selected.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. This setting will block everyone in your organization, including admins, from sending B2B collaboration invitations to external users.
    - content: Check your Collaboration restrictions to make sure that if “Deny invitations to the specified domains” is selected, the domains you want to invite are *not* listed.
      isCorrect: True
      explanation: Correct. This setting will block B2B collaboration with any domain that's listed below it. If this setting is selected, you'll want to make sure the domain you want to collaborate with hasn't been added to the list.
  - content: At what levels can multi-factor authentication be enforced?
    choices:
    - content: Application level, user level, and category level.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. There is no such thing as *category level* in multi-factor authentication enforcement that uses Conditional Access policies.
    - content: Tenant level, user level, and application level.
      isCorrect: True
      explanation: Correct. You can enforce multi-factor authentication at different scopes through Conditional Access policies. This means that you can further secure your collaboration in Azure AD B2B.
    - content: User level, application level, and strength level.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. There is no such thing as *strength level* in multi-factor authentication enforcement that uses Conditional Access policies.
  - content: Which of the following are valid categories for multi-factor authentication?
    choices:
    - content: Something a user possesses, and something the user does not know.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. Something the user does not know is not a valid category.
    - content: Something a user knows, and something the user does not possess.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. Something the user does not possess is not a valid category.
    - content: Something a user possesses, and something a user knows.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Authentication can be dependent on something such as a user's device, or a phrase only known to the user.
