Organizations naturally need to collaborate with external users. These external users may be needed to provide vital services and work. As a result, applications and resources must often be shared between an organization and external users. These external users can be individuals without an IT department behind them, or they can be part of another organization with their own IT infrastructure.

Organizations have to ensure that any sharing process is secure, and access is only given to the right permission levels necessary and for the right amount of time necessary. Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration (Azure AD B2B) makes it possible for organizations to collaborate with its external users by allowing applications and resources to shared, securely.

You're the solution architect for a health care organization. Your organization is publishing an application that allows clinicians from partnering health providers to access health records for patients at your facilities. You need to enable the ability for these organizations to collaborate in a secure way.

In this module, you'll use Azure AD B2B to collaborate securely with external users. You'll use the Azure portal to invite guest users to a directory, a group, or an application. You'll also learn how you can use multi-factor authentication with Azure AD B2B to add additional protection to your shared applications.
