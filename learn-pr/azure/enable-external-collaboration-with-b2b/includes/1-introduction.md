Organizations often need to collaborate with external partners, distributors, suppliers, and vendors. They want to do so in a secure way that lets external users access their apps, but that doesn't require the organization to manage external accounts and passwords.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're an IT admin for a healthcare organization. Your company is publishing an application that allows clinicians from partnering health providers to access health records for patients at your facilities. To safeguard this sensitive health data, you want only authorized clinicians to have access to the app. You don't want to create credentials in your directory that the clinician has to remember and that you have to maintain. However, you do want to make sure the external user is properly authenticated through their identity provider and through your multi-factor authentication policies.

## What will we be doing?

This module shows you how to share applications with external users so they can sign in using their own work, school, or social identities. You will invite a user to access an app using Azure AD B2B collaboration. You will also apply multi-factor authentication to external user sign-ins for added security.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you will be able to use the portal to send an invitation to a B2B collaboration user and apply multi-factor authentication policies to external users.
