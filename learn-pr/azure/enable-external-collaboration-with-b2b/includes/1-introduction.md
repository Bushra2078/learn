You're the solution architect for a health care organization. Your organization is publishing an application that allows clinicians from partnering health providers to access health records for patients at your facilities. You need to make it possible for them to collaborate in a secure way.

In this module, you'll use Azure AD B2B to collaborate securely with external users. You'll use the Azure portal to invite guest users to a directory, a group, or an application. You'll also learn how you can use multi-factor authentication with Azure AD B2B to add additional protection to your shared applications.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to configure Azure AD B2B so your company can collaborate with external users.
