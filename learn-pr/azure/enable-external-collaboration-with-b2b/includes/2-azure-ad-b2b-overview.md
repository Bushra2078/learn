As you prepare to use B2B collaboration for external clinicians who need access to your app, let's take a look at how the feature works.

## What is Azure AD B2B collaboration?

Azure AD B2B collaboration is a way to invite anyone to access the apps and resources you want to share with them. When an external user accepts a B2B collaboration invitation from you, they can access the apps and resources you want to share with them, including Office 365 apps, software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps, and line-of-business applications.

Once you invite a user to B2B collaboration, a user object is created for them in the same Azure AD directory where you manage your employees. This user object can be managed like other user objects in your directory, meaning you can assign permissions, add it to groups, and so on.

There are no credentials associated with B2B collaboration users. Instead, they authenticate with their home organization or identity provider, and then your organization checks the B2B collaboration userâ€™s eligibility for B2B collaboration.

## What happens when you invite a B2B collaboration user

The following steps show how Azure AD B2B lets you collaborate with external partner users. The numbers in the diagram are explained in the subsequent sections.

1. **Send a B2B collaboration invitation to the user**

    First, you invite the external user as B2B collaboration user to your directory. There are different ways you can invite a B2B collaboration user, such as through Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal. You can invite users as individuals one at a time, or in bulk. For example, to invite an individual by using the Azure portal, you fill in a form with your B2B collaboration user's details and a custom invitation message.

    B2B collaboration users will show up in your directory, in the list of users. From here, you can manage users by making changes, removing users, or adding new ones.

1. **The B2B collaboration user accepts your invitation and reviews privacy information**

    At the second stage in the diagram, the B2B collaboration user receives an invitation via email, and then uses the **Accept invitation** link to access the services you want to share with them. The first time they use this link, they'll be asked to consent to privacy information and terms of use.

1. **The user completes multi-factor authentication**

    At this point, if you've enabled multi-factor authentication, the user provides these extra details for their account. When multi-factor authentication is configured, the user must enter a verification code sent to their mobile device, before they're granted access.

1. **The user finds your apps on their access panel**

    Your B2B collaboration user is then forwarded to the access panel page, where they can access all the applications and services you've shared with them. These applications and services can be cloud-based, or on-premises.
