# Spatial Audio Tutorials

 Through this module series, you will learn how to use head-related transfer function (HRTF) offload on HoloLens 2 and How to enable reverb when using HRTF offload.

## Learning Objectives

* Importing and Enabling Microsoft spatializer plugin
* Enabling Spatial audio on your developer workstation
* Add and Spatialize the button click sounds
* Import a video and add a Video Player
* Play the video onto a quadrangle
* Route audio from the video to the quadrangle, and spatialize the audio
* Add a new script to control spatialization on a game object
* Drive the spatialization control script from button actions
* Improve perceived distance of sound sources by adding reverb.
* Control perceived distance of the sound using the listener's distance to the hologram.

## Prerequisites

* A Windows 10 PC configured with [the correct tools](/windows/mixed-reality/install-the-tools)
* Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later
* Unity Hub with Unity 2020.3.X or 2019.4.X installed and the Universal Windows Platform Build Support module added
* [Set up a mixed reality project in Unity module](/learn/modules/mixed-reality-toolkit-project-unity)
* [Mixed Reality Feature Tool](https://aka.ms/MRFeatureTool)
* Basic familiarity with Unity - interface, scene creation, package import, addition of GameObjects to a scene
