title: Activate spatial audio for your HoloLens 2 application
summary: Learn about spatial audio to enhance your learning experience. Explores the use of spatial audio by integrating it to a HoloLens 2 application.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module you will be able to:
  - import Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)
  - import and enable the Microsoft Spatializer plugin and also to enable the spatial audio on your workstation. 
  - spatialize the button interaction sounds and to use an audio clip to test spatialized button interaction.
  - spatialize audio from an video source Try out your app on a HoloLens 2 or in the Unity editor. You'll see and hear the video, and the audio from the video is spatialized.
  - enable and disable spatialization at run time, test out the app on a HoloLens 2 or in the Unity editor. In the app, you can now click the button to activate and deactivate spatialization of the audio.
