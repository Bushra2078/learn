| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

DevOps is a community of practice where diversity of perspective and skills drives toward one mission. Teams must foster a collaborative environment of shared knowledge instead of siloed learning. Use shared functions to strive to overcome resource constraints.

A good DevOps culture thrives on shared responsibility. Development and operations teams should align their goals and priorities with the expectations of their customers and keep business focus in mind. The development team should involve the operations team in the feedback loop so the improvements are driven upstream and other teams benefit equally. Conversely, operations teams are responsible for making the development team successful in their business outcomes by sharing resources and feedback that are relevant to the workload.

At the same time, DevOps practices apply clear lines of ownership and accountability to each team. Regardless of where the application runs, the workload team is responsible for that application.

DevOps optimizes operational tasks so that they're effective but not burdensome. To reap the full benefit of DevOps, the culture should optimize processes through technology and have processes for people in the organization to promote transparent communication.

**Example scenario**

Contoso's Human Resources (HR) department is kicking off a project to develop a new line-of-business (LOB) app for their department's internal use. The app is currently in the planning phase, no design or implementation work has begun yet.

## Collaborate efficiently

**Use common systems and tools that promote a collaborative environment for communication and tracking progress.**

Common tools and processes enable transparent communication. Both development and operations teams benefit from situational awareness across various environments, common support issues, and overall challenges and wins.

Teams will already be familiar with existing escalation paths if there's an incident.

A shared backlog makes priorities, such as working on new features or fixing bugs, clear.

*Contoso's challenge*

- Currently there are no standard communication and project tracking tools that are consistently used across the three technical teams: development, test, and operations.
- Each team has been able to select their tools of choice. Some use slack and other Microsoft Teams, some use AzDO and others excel to track tasks. And they use different document repositories to share knowledge and incident response procedures. 
- Contoso HR would like to improve productivity and avoid situations from the past when the lack of common tooling made it difficult for the team to stay connected and collaborate.
