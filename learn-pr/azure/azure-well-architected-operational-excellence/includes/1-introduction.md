The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a design framework that can improve the quality of a workload by helping it to:

- Be resilient, available, and recoverable.
- Be as secure as you need it to be.
- Deliver a sufficient return on investment.
- Support responsible development and operations.
- Accomplish its purpose within acceptable timeframes.

The concepts described in this module are not all-inclusive of security in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches when you're designing a workload. For a complete perspective, across all of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, visit the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecure.

Each unit in this module focuses on one design principle and three approaches associated with that principle. The approaches in each unit are supported through the use of examples to help demonstrate how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on a fictional company.
