How operationally mature is your cloud environment? Are you incorporating modern practices such as DevOps into the way your organization operates? Are you able to assess the health of your infrastructure? Are adverse events visible and actionable? Are you provisioning resources manually, or have you automated them to reduce risk and increase efficiency? Here, you will learn how to answer these questions and improve the operations of your Azure cloud deployments. In this module, you'll learn about the *Operational Excellence* pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework.
