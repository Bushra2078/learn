Organizations often have many different, sometimes short-lived, software environments. 
For example, developers need an environment with all developer tools installed, the test team has temporary test environments, and customer support requires a separate environment for each supported production version.
Azure DevTest Labs lets you simplify and accelerate the process of creating virtual computing environments.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at an eCommerce company that offers fashion and lifestyle products to consumers. Your company operates in a highly competitive market where you need to innovate rapidly to keep your customer engagement high.
As the development team expands rapidly to keep up with new feature development, you have to quickly spin up and configure developer machines.
At the end of each weekly sprint, the test team runs their test plans on the latest application version in a fresh test environment.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll configure a development lab from a base image and specify the software to pre-install. You'll then use this lab to spin up a development virtual machine. You can then access the development VM by using Remote Desktop software.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create development labs by using Azure DevTest Labs, each configured with a specific operating system and required software components.
