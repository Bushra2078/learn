Organizations often have many different, sometimes short-lived, software environments. 
For example, developers need an environment with all developer tools installed, the test team has temporary test environments, and customer support requires a separate environment for each supported production version.

You've created a lab in Azure DevTest Labs to define a curated list of base images for developer VMs, and to configure an auto shutdown policy to save costs. You then added developer VMs to the lab, which you pre-configured with Azure PowerShell. Finally, you claimed a VM and connected to it by using RDP.

Imagine how much work it would be for each developer to prepare a new developer environment, and install all the necessary tools and software. As a company, how would you keep track of all different OS versions and computing resources.

Azure DevTest Labs lets you simplify and accelerate the process of creating standardized virtual computing environments.

Now, when you want to create VMs for development, training, or other purposes, you can use Azure DevTest Labs to provide users a self-service experience, while still maintaining control as an IT organization.
