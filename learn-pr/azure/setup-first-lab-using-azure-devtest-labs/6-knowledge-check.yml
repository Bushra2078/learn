  questions:
  - content: "Resources in Azure are hosted in an Azure region. The location of a lab VM is configured when:"
    choices:
    - content: "Adding a lab VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The Azure region for a lab VM can't be configured."
    - content: "Claiming a VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The Azure region for a claimable VM can't be configured."
    - content: "Creating a DevTest Lab."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The location of the DevTest Lab determines the location of all VMs created in the lab."
  - content: "Eve needs to debug an application problem on Jim's developer VM. What is the right approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "Eve selects the Azure DevTest Labs resource in the Azure portal, and connects to Jim's lab VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. To connect to a lab VM, you first need to claim the VM. Only one person can claim a lab VM at a time. Because Jim already owns the lab VM, Eve can't connect to it."
    - content: "Eve selects the Azure DevTest Labs resource in the Azure portal, and claims a new lab VM to debug the application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Each lab VM is a separate VM instance. The VMs are created from the same base image but share no runtime state."
    - content: "Jim unclaims the developer VM, after which Eve can claim the same VM to debug the application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Because only one person can connect to a VM at a time, Jim needs to be first unclaim the VM. Eve can then claim it and debug the application in the state it was for Jim."
  - content: "The eCommerce company has a Node.js and Python development team. They use Linux VMs for their development activities. What is the best approach for configuring Azure DevTest Labs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure DevTest Labs resource, and then create a pool of lab VMs for each team."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An Azure DevTest Labs resource can contain multiple lab VMs with multiple VM instances. Each pool of lab VMs can be pre-configured with artifacts according to the specific needs of the team."
    - content: "Create an Azure DevTest Labs resource for each developer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. An Azure DevTest Labs resource doesn't contain any compute resources. The resource only specifies the configuration and policies for compute resources."
    - content: "Create an Azure DevTest Labs resource, and then create an environment for each team."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Environments in Azure DevTest Labs enable you to create ARM-based compute resources, such as PaaS services. The developers need a VM for their development activities."
