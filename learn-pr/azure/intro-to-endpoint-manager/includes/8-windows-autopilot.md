Windows Autopilot simplifies enrolling devices in Intune. You provide the enrollment details up front before the end user receives a new computer. The Windows Autopilot process runs immediately after powering on a new computer for the first time, enabling employees to configure new devices to be business-ready with just a few clicks. You can also use Windows Autopilot to reset, repurpose, and recover devices. Leveraging cloud-based services, you can automatically join devices to Azure AD, auto-enroll devices into MDM services, such as Microsoft Intune, restrict rights on the computer, auto-assign devices to configuration groups, and customize the Out-of-box-experience (OOBE) content to be specific for your organization.
