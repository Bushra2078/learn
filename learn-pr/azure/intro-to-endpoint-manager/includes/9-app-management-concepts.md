In addition to managing and protecting the devices that the members of your organization use, the apps can also be managed. By allowing Intune and Config Manager to manage apps, your organization gains the following benefits:



As an IT admin, you can use Microsoft Intune to manage the client apps that your company's workforce uses. This functionality is in addition to managing devices and protecting data. One of an admin's priorities is to ensure that end users have access to the apps they need to do their work. This goal can be a challenge because:

- There are a wide range of device platforms and app types.
- You might need to manage apps on both company devices and users' personal devices.
- You must ensure that your network and your data remain secure.

Additionally, you might want to assign and manage apps on devices that are not enrolled with Intune.
