In this module, you've learned about Microsoft Endpoint Manager, what it is and its key capabilities. Here are some of the things you covered.

- Endpoint Manager integrates Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Desktop Analytics, and Windows Autopilot. 
- Endpoint Manager helps keep your organization's cloud and on-premises devices, apps, and data secure.
- Endpoint Manager is used to manage an organization's endpoints. Endpoints include mobile devices, desktop computers, servers, and apps that an organization uses. Additionally, endpoints also include the apps used by an organization. These endpoints are managed in different environments based on where these endpoints are located.
- Endpoint Manager supports several device platforms. The available platforms that can be managed by Endpoint Manager include iOS/iPadOS, Windows, Android, and macOS. 
- Provisioning is a process when your organization issues new or repurposed devices to individuals in your organization. As part of the process, the individual user signs in to the device and steps through the process of connecting to your organization. You can either enroll the devices with Intune or Configuration Manager during the provisioning process or after, depending on the platform and your needs.
- Before you can safeguard the devices that access your organization's resources, you must enroll them. Enrolling means that the device is connected and recognized by Intune or Configuration Manager based on a mobile device management (MDM) certificate. There are several methods to enroll your workforce's devices. Each method depends on device ownership (personal or corporate), device type (iOS/iPadOS, Windows, Android, macOS), and device management requirements (resets, affinity, locking).
- You can use Microsoft Intune to manage the apps that your company's workforce uses on their devices. This functionality is called mobile application management (MAM). MAM in Intune is designed to protect organization data at the application level, including custom apps and store apps. App management can be used on organization-owned devices and personal devices. When it is used with personal devices, only organization-related access and data is managed.
- Intune uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups to manage devices and users. As an Intune admin, you can set up groups to suit your organizational needs. Create groups to organize users or devices by geographic location, department, or hardware characteristics. Use groups to manage tasks at scale. 
- Conditional Access makes sure that only trusted users can access organizational resources on trusted devices using trusted apps. 
- Microsoft Endpoint Manager allows you to configure device security and to manage security tasks for devices when those devices are at risk.
- Intune and Configuration Manager provide a number of tools you can use to resolve compliance issues for end user's devices and apps, as well as your tenant.
