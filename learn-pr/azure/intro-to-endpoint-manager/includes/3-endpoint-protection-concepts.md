Microsoft Endpoint Mananger helps you protect the digital resources that your organization uses. These resources include devices, apps, and data. You use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center to configure the settings that are then applied to the devices and users of your organization. Those settings are contained in policies that you create. You assign the policies to groups that you define. Those groups are either users or devices.
