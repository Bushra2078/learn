Microsoft Endpoint Manager is used to manage your organization's endpoints. These endpoint locations include cloud endpoints, on-premises endpoints, cloud + on-premises endpoints, and co-managed endpoints.

#### Cloud endpoint management

You can manage devices, apps and data by using a cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) service, such as Microsoft Intune. Intune is included in Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) suite, and enables users to be productive while keeping your organization data protected. It integrates with other services, including Microsoft 365 and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to control who has access, and what they have access to, and Azure Information Protection for data protection. When you use it with Microsoft 365, you can enable your workforce to be productive on all their devices, while keeping your organization's information protected.

#### On-premises endpoint management

By using an on-premises endpoint management solution, you can manage your on-premise  Windows 10 devices, apps and data. By restricting access and location, your environment is more secure. Your end-users will not be able to access company apps and data using remote devices. Also, those remote devices will not be protected as corporately recognized endpoints.

#### Cloud + on-premises endpoint management

For Configuration Manager managed devices, data can also flow to Microsoft Endpoint Management through the ConfigMgr connector. This is call cloud attached, where the ConfigMgr connector is attached to the cloud. It  requires a connection to an Intune tenant, and doesn't not require turning on co-management.
 
#### Co-managed endpoint management

Co-management is where you concurrently manage Windows 10 devices with both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. Co-management combines  your existing on-premises Configuration Manager investment with the cloud, by using Intune and other Microsoft 365 cloud services. You choose whether Configuration Manager or Intune is the management authority. By using co-management, you keep some tasks on-premises, while running other tasks in the cloud with Intune.
