<!-- Endpoint Manager capabilities
Slides 12-24 -->
Effectively managing endpoints presents a number of challenges. For instance, how do you manage existing investments? How do you provide proper security in the form of access control and encryption? What do you determine which user, device, or app is in compliance based on your corporate requirements? 

Microsoft Endpoint Manager provides the services and tools you need in one location to manage your organization's endpoint. 

Modern IT provides cloud intelligence at the core. Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) provides this modern management. MEM doesn't require you to make an either/or decision between on-prem and cloud management. You can do both, and modernize at your own pace, to manage risk in a smart way. To take advantage of the cloud and modern IT, but also give you the tools and capabilities to also manage your existing on-prem investments.

Microsoft Endpoint Manager has the following attributes:
- Secure and Intelligent
- Streamlined and Flexible
- Maximized Investment

## Benefits of Co-Management

Co-management adds new functionality to your existing Configuration Manager deployment, without changing how you already work. When you enable co-management, you immediately begin benefitting from the cloud. You can apply that value to your existing management infrastructure and processes.

When you enroll existing Configuration Manager clients in co-management, you gain the following immediate value:  

- Conditional access with device compliance  
- Intune-based remote actions, for example: restart, remote control, or factory reset
- Centralized visibility of device health  
- Link users, devices, and apps with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)  
- Modern provisioning with Windows Autopilot  
- Remote actions
