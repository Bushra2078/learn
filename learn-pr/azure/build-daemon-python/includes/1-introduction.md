Organizations build apps to serve various use cases. While most applications require users to interact with them, there are also requirements to build applications that are secure and don't require user interaction. A monthly report generation application is a perfect example of a batch job. These apps, given that they access resources independently of users, need to prove their identity. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) lets you authenticate your app and provide authorized access to a protected web API.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a financial company as a software architect. The company depends on many applications that run as background processes rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. These applications support business operations such as generating loan reports, loan repayment reports, and processing payroll at the end of the month.

Your company uses Azure AD, which is an identity provider, to ensure that company data is accessed in a secure way.Â You've been tasked with the responsibility of building an application that will acquire a token to call a protected web API on behalf of itself.

## What will you be doing?

Azure AD is a centralized identity provider that allows a developer to build an application that acquires a token to call a web API on behalf of itself. In the following flow, the app interacts directly with the Azure AD `/token` endpoint to obtain access:

In this module, you:

- Prepare Azure AD tenant to authenticate an app.
- Configure a Python daemon app to request an access token by using its own identity.
- Authorize a daemon app to call a protected web API.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create a Python daemon app that uses its own identity and acquires a valid access token to call a protected web API.
