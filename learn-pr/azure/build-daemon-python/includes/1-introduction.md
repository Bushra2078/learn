Organizations build apps to serve various use cases. For example, they may need to build apps that acquire a token for their own identities to call a protected web API. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) lets you authenticate your app and provide authorized access to a protected web API.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a financial technology company as a software developer. Your company is looking to develop an automated service to help customers pay their obligations on time by sending a notification before the due date. Your company uses Python to develop applications. You've been tasked with the responsibility of building an application that runs in the background to call a protected web API.

## What will you be doing?

In this module, you'll:

- Register an application with an Azure AD tenant.
- Enable a daemon app to authenticate and acquire an access token from Azure AD.
- Use an access token to call a protected web API.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create a Python daemon app that uses its own identity and acquires a valid access token to call a protected web API.
