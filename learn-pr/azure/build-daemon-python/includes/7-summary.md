Our finance team needed to notify our customers of their upcoming obligations before the due date. We built a Python daemon app that represents a confidential client app that calls Microsoft Graph as itself to read customers' data from a resource. The Microsoft identity platform lets us register a Python daemon app to perform identity and access management (IAM). The Azure portal displays the app registration's Overview pane. We see the Application (client) ID. Also called the client ID, this value uniquely identifies our application within the Microsoft identity platform. We used the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Python to create a client-confidential application. Finally, we acquire an access token and call the Microsoft Graph.

The Microsoft identity platform lets us register a daemon app to perform identity and access management (IAM). The Azure portal displays the app registration's **Overview** pane. We see the **Application (client) ID**. Also called the _client ID_, this value uniquely identifies our application in the Microsoft identity platform. We used Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Python to create a client confidential application. Finally, we use API model in MSAL to explicit control on how to utilize token cache and call the Microsoft Graph.

Imagine how much work it would be to build a client confidential application from scratch. We’d have to write code to create our own identity provider, develop a rest API service and create a secure library to interact with our identity provider. Once all the code is ready, we would need a server to host the code.

The Microsoft identity platform, the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and Microsoft Graph made it easy to create a daemon app. Building a Python daemon app took us less than an hour and we didn’t have to set up any servers. We can now read customer data from a resource and notify our customers of their upcoming obligations.
