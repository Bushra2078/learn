## Module: Deploy Microsoft Microsoft Sentinel

### Summary description

Contoso is planning to deploy Microsoft Sentinel to modernize their security operations with a cloud-native SIEM, to get centralized security visibility across their enterprise while eliminating complexity of infrastructure maintenance.

In this module, you'll learn about the necessary roles and permissions you must consider during deployment, and how to connect data sources to Microsoft Sentinel and manage its log data.
<!-- delete "and" before "how to connect data sources..." -->

**Problem statements:**

- "What roles and permissions must I consider when planning to implement Microsoft Sentinel?"
- "How can I connect data sources to Microsoft Sentinel?"

### Prerequisites

To derive the best learning experience from this module, you should have
knowledge of, and experience with:

- Access to Azure Portal
- Fundamental Microsoft Azure administration.
- Azure Monitor and its Log Analytics workspace.

### Scenario with task(s) at end
Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Contoso has moved aggressively to Azure services, and they currently use Microsoft 365 and Azure AD. They also use Azure Identity Protection, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, Azure Advanced Threat Protection, Windows Advanced Threat Protection, Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, Intune, and Azure Information Protection. They are also using the free security posture management capabilities provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud and are upgrading to standard paid version to get threat protection for resources running in Azure and on-premises. In addition, Contoso has other non-Microsoft assets to monitor and protect.
<!-- delete "and" before "they currently use Microsoft 365 and Azure AD" -->
<!-- Replace "Intune" with "Microsoft Intune" -->

Contosoâ€™s IT director realizes that their Security Analysts face a huge triage burden as they not only have to sift through a sea of alerts, but also correlate alerts from different product dashboards manually or by using a traditional correlation engine.
<!-- "a sea of alerts" might not translate to other languages, please consider replacing with "numerous alerts" -->

The IT director believes that Microsoft Sentinel could provide a means to address the pain points of Contoso. They are:

- multiple products
- to many alerts triaged across dashboards
- security operations team having to setup and maintain IT infrastructure, taking their time away from security tasks

She  believe that Microsoft Sentinel will help them save time performing complex investigations, and improve their security operations (secops).

As Contoso's lead system engineer and Azure administrator, you've been asked to set up a proof-of-concept environment trial to verify whether Microsoft Sentinel can harness the power of the cloud and artificial intelligence to help their security operations teams efficiently identify and stop cyberattacks before they cause harm.

In this module, you will learn about the deployment considerations to include the necessary roles and permission. You will also learn how to connect data sources to Microsoft Sentinel and how to manage its log data.


### Learning objectives

- Describe Microsoft Sentinel.
- Describe deployment considerations for Microsoft Sentinel.
- Create an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
- Enable Microsoft Sentinel.
- Explain how to deploy built-in connectors to Microsoft Sentinel.
