Our goal was to help you evaluate whether the Red Hat solutions – Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform – are a good choice for modernizing and scaling your Linux workloads in the cloud. We developed some criteria to make this decision, including:

- Type of application
- App development strategy
- Programing language
- Infrastructure environment

We applied these criteria to the fictional online retailer in our scenario. They were already running Red Hat on-premises and they needed the speed of containerization for their app development strategy. They were also running a Java-based website, and were looking to migrate Azure. We determined that a combination of using RHEL, ARO, and JBoss EAP is appropriate for their situation.
