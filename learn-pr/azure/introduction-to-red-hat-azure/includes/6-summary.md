Our goal was to help you evaluate whether the Red Hat solutions – Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform – would be a good choice for modernizing and scaling your Linux workloads in the cloud. We developed some criteria to make this decision, including:

- Type of application running
- App development strategy
- Programing language used
- Infrastructure environment

We applied these criteria to the fictional online retailer to show that since they were already running Red Hat on-premises, needed the speed of containerization for their app development strategy, were running a Java-based website, and looking to migrate Azure, a combination of using RHEL, ARO, and JBoss EAP is appropriate.
