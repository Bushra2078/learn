Here, we'll discuss how the different deployment options for Red Hat on Azure work behind the scenes. You'll learn about the benefits of using one and see how they can work together to help you build and support nearly any kind of application or workload. This knowledge will help you decide whether one of these Red Hat on Azure deployment options will suit your Red Hat workload.

## How Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on Azure works

Red Hat Enterprise Linux provides a tested, secure, and supportable base for enterprise class applications and services to be built on. It combines the Linux kernel along with hundreds of industry leading open-source projects into a distribution with a 10-year support lifecycle. Red Hat works with Azure, and other in its extensive partner network, to ensure compatibility across multiple architectures and multiple deployment platforms. So, regardless if a workload is deployed at the edge, in on-premises datacenters, or on Azure, RHEL is available.

## How Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) works

Azure Red Hat OpenShift is OpenShift that is jointly engineered, operated, and supported by Red Hat and Microsoft. They work together to provide an integrated support experience. There are no virtual machines to operate and no patching is required. Master, infrastructure, and application nodes are patched, updated, and monitored on your behalf by Red Hat and Microsoft. Your Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters are deployed into your Azure subscription and are included on your Azure bill.

### OpenShift background

Running containers in production with Kubernetes requires additional tools and resources. This often includes needing to juggle image registries, storage management, networking solutions, and logging and monitoring tools - all of which must be versioned and tested together. Building container-based applications requires even more integration work with middleware, frameworks, databases, and CI/CD tools. OpenShift combines all this into a single platform, bringing ease of operations to IT teams while giving application teams what they need to execute.

OpenShift at its core is a fully-compliant instance of upstream Kubernetes which has been hardened with hundreds of fixes that address defect, security, and performance issues in every release. It is integrated with, and tested against, with dozens of technologies and is a robust tightly-integrated platform.

### How ARO differs from OpenShift

OpenShift is the platform which runs your applications, but to provide that platform OpenShift relies on infrastructure components like virtual machines, storage, load balancers, and other network components to provide those services. The difference between an OpenShift subscription directly from Red Hat and one provided by Azure Red Hat OpenShift is ARO also includes the underpinning components and the management of them.

This means you do not need to know how to install or provision OpenShift and all its prerequisites to gets it benefits from day one, and in addition Microsoft and Red Hat jointly manage all on-going day two operations including server maintenance, updates, and security patches.

## How JBoss EAP in Azure works

JBoss EAP helps you upgrade from proprietary or outdated middleware to an open-source platform and increase your runtimes through Red Hatâ€™s application modernization and migration solution. The JBoss approach minimizes your effort, time, and risk, helping to reduce app costs, improve operational efficiency, and boost developer productivity for faster software delivery cycles.

As part of the Red Hat Application Services portfolio of middleware products, JBoss EAP gives developers, architects, and IT leaders the ability to create, integrate, and automate applications. The portfolio has been engineered together to help develop, implement and run business applications cost-effectively at scale. Red Hat Application Services support your hybrid cloud journey by being able to run the same workloads on-site, in the cloud, or within a container platform, like Red Hat OpenShift.

Regardless, of whether you already have existing licenses JBoss subscriptions on-premises or are starting fresh with new subscriptions on Azure, the Red Hat Cloud Access program allows you to use any JBoss EAP subscription to install JBoss EAP on your own Azure virtual machine or one of the on-demand operating systems from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Note that virtual machine operating system subscriptions are separate from a JBoss EAP subscription.
