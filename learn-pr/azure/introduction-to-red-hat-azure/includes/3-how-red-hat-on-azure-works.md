## How RHEL works

RHEL provides a tested secure and supportive base on which you can build your enterprise-class applications and services. RHEL combines the Linux kernel with hundreds of industry-leading open-source projects into a distribution with a 10-year support lifecycle. Red Hat works with Azure and its other network partners to ensure compatibility across multiple architectures and deployment platforms.

## How ARO works

ARO is OpenShift that Microsoft and Red Hat work together to manage and support. With ARO, you don't have any VMs to operate and no patching is required. Microsoft and Red Hat patch, update, and monitor your main, infrastructure, and application nodes. Your ARO clusters are deployed into your Azure subscription and are included on your Azure bill.

### How OpenShift works

Running containers in production with Kubernetes requires extra tools and resources, including image registry monitoring, storage management, networking, and logging and monitoring tools - all of which must be versioned and tested together. Building container-based applications requires even more integration work with middleware, frameworks, databases, and CI/CD tools. OpenShift combines these capabilities into a single platform, bringing ease of operations to IT teams while giving application teams what they need to execute.

OpenShift is a fully compliant instance of upstream Kubernetes, hardened with hundreds of fixes that address defect, security, and performance issues in every release. It's integrated with and tested against dozens of technologies and provides a robust, tightly integrated platform.

### Differences between OpenShift and ARO

OpenShift is the platform that runs your applications. To provide that platform, OpenShift relies on infrastructure components like VMs, storage, load balancers, and other network components. The difference between an OpenShift subscription directly from Red Hat and one provided by Azure Red Hat OpenShift is that ARO also includes the underpinning components and the management of them.

## How JBoss EAP works

JBoss EAP helps you upgrade from proprietary or outdated middleware to an open-source platform. JBoss EAP helps increase runtime through the use of Red Hatâ€™s application modernization and migration solutions. The JBoss approach minimizes your effort, time, and risk by reducing app costs, improving operational efficiency, and boosting developer productivity.

JBoss EAP is part of the Red Hat Application Services portfolio of middleware products, which helps users create, integrate, and automate applications. Red Hat Application Services supports your hybrid cloud journey by running the same workloads on-site, in the cloud, or within a container platform, like Red Hat OpenShift.

Whether you already have existing licenses JBoss subscriptions on-premises or are starting fresh with new subscriptions on Azure, the Red Hat Cloud Access program allows you to use any JBoss EAP subscription. You can use a subscription to install JBoss EAP on your own Azure VM or one of the on-demand operating systems from the Azure Marketplace. VM operating system subscriptions are separate from JBoss EAP subscriptions.
