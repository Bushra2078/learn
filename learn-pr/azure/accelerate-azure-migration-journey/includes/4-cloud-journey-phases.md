The stages of your migration journey
Cloud migration involves significant organizational change management spanning people, process, and technology. Taking a holistic approach will not only help you navigate the journey successfully but also ensure that your organization realizes new benefits—including efficiency, agility, and scale—once your workloads are running in the cloud.


This unit introduces the phases of a cloud journey to the learner.  Discussion includes the phases and the activities that will need to be completed for a successful adoption of Azure. 

## Define Strategy

Decide on a migration or modernization approach.

Define your approach based on three considerations: migration triggers, business goals, and workload priorities. Migrate if you have time-sensitive triggers. Modernize for targeted and business-critical workloads that will see continued investment

Involve key stakeholders to create a cloud migration center of excellence.
Facilitate a smoother, faster migration that meets organizational goals by enlisting the broad support of a cross-functional team made up of IT, finance, and business owners.

### Approach: Migrate or Modernize

## Plan

Discover and assess your apps, databases, and infrastructure.
Get insights into your dependencies using automated cloud migration tools. Inventory your infrastructure and assess your on-premises environments—get right-sizing guidance, workload-level cost estimates, and performance metrics.

Calculate total cost of ownership (TCO) to make a business case for migration.
Evaluate the potential cost savings of migrating to Azure by calculating and comparing your TCO for Azure with that of a comparable on-premises deployment. aka.ms/azuretco  aka.ms/cloudbizcase 

ROI
At the highest level, the formula for business justification is simple. But the subtle data points required to populate the formula can be difficult to align. On a basic level, the business justification focuses on the return on investment (ROI) associated with the proposed technical change. The generic formula for ROI is:

Build a holistic migration plan.
Account for workload priorities, timelines, milestones, resources, and funding. Then break up your overall plan into migration projects, each with a group of related workloads. Get buy-in from leadership and your new migration center of excellence.

## Ready

Build cloud skills.
Get your IT and app development teams up to speed on cloud technologies, migration tools, and operational processes. Upfront training investment helps you to scale your migration efforts more efficiently and set up your organization for success.

Set up a landing zone for your workloads.
Pre-configured landing zones include networking, identity, management, security, and governance elements that balance agility with organizational standards. By using landing zone best practices, you avoid governance issues during and after migration.

## Adopt

Migrate and modernize in waves with an iterative approach.
Pick a manageable-sized cohort of workloads for each wave and perform the move using automated tools. Select the target cloud services to move your workloads into—like Azure IaaS for infrastructure or Azure App Service for web apps.
