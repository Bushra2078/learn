Azure provides access to a comprehensive set of cloud services. As developers and IT professionals, you can use these services to build, deploy, and manage applications on a range of tools and frameworks through a global network of data centers. As your business faces challenges associated with the digital shift, the Azure platform helps you to figure out how to:

- Optimize resources and operations
- Engage with your customers and employees
- Transform your products
  
The cloud provides advantages for speed and flexibility, minimized costs, performance, and reliability. But many organizations will need to continue to run on-premises data centers. In response to cloud adoption barriers, Azure provides a hybrid cloud strategy that builds bridges between your on-premises data centers and the Azure public cloud. An example is using Azure cloud resources like Azure Backup to protect on-premises resources or Azure analytics to gain insights into on-premises workloads.

As part of the hybrid cloud strategy, Azure provides growing solutions for migrating on-premises applications and workloads to the cloud. With simple steps, you can comprehensively assess your on-premises resources to figure out how they'll run in the Azure platform. Then, with a deep assessment in hand, you can confidently migrate resources to Azure. When resources are up and running in Azure, you can optimize them to retain and improve access, flexibility, security, and reliability.

Azure and Azure Migrate are both well known for hosting Microsoft technologies. But you might not be aware of Azure's ability to support migrations beyond Windows and SQL Server. The One Migration scenarios captured in the Migrate methodology demonstrate the same set of consistent guidelines and processes for migrating both Microsoft and third-party technologies.

## DevTest
Improve software quality and reduce costs by moving DevTest environments to Azure. Quickly deploy and manage hundreds of VMs for development and testing.

## Windows & SQL Server

## Linux & open-source databases

Easily move on-premises Windows and Linux distributions to Azure. Extend your VMware environments to Azure with Azure VMware Solution.

Migrate SQL Server to Azure Virtual Machines or a fully managed option like Azure SQL Database. Move MySQL and PostgreSQL to fully managed Azure services. Get minimal downtime and built-in HA, monitoring, and security.


## Web Apps
Spend more time creating value for your customers and less time managing infrastructure by moving your .NET and PHP web apps to Azure App Service.

## Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
Simplify virtual desktops management on Azure with Windows Virtual Desktop. Run multi-session Windows 10, optimize Office 365 ProPlus, and get support for remote data service environments.

 Azure Migrate helps you assess VDI—select Lakeside, a VDI assessment tool, when you create a new project.

## Specialized workloads such as SAP, VMware, NetApp, Oracle
