One crucial part of building a cloud migration strategy for an organization is identifying which drivers
are triggering the need for cloud adoption. Some drivers may prompt quick action, while others may call
for a more involved, hands-on approach.

Understanding the challenges a business is facing and how migration drivers map to those challenges
can help determine what strategy to take when moving to the cloud. In some cases, it might be best to
lift-and-shift (rehost) your workloads while in other cases re-platforming of your applications might be
necessary.

## Migration drivers
- Datacenter contract expiration
- Cash flow challenges
- Resource constraints
- Business continuity
- Resilient apps and operations
- Cybersecurity threats

### Datacenter contract expiration

The expiration of datacenter contracts can be viewed as a good opportunity for beginning the cloud
migration journey, since many organizations may consider if it’s worth continuing to run their own
datacenter if they’re facing resource and cash flow challenges.

#### Eliminate recurring expenses

- Owning and managing physical datacenters can be expensive, both in terms of financial cost and effort.
- Datacenter contract expiration can be an inflection point to
consider cloud migration, as it can provide almost immediate
benefits in the form of cost reductions, better performance, and
simpler management.
- Moving datacenter operations to the cloud frees you from recurring
contract expenses, and provides built-in scalability and other key
management features that make it much easier to run your
datacenter efficiently

### Cash flow challenges

One of the most impactful incentives of the cloud and adopting a more flexible operating model is the opportunity to
eliminate large upfront investments in physical infrastructure assets.

Identifying areas to optimize costs and free up resources for growth and innovation are critical to helping you
establish your business case for migrating to the cloud.

#### Shift from CAPEX to OPEX

Maintaining a physical datacenter can cause serious cash flow challenges, since there are typically investments reserved for infrastructure.
Moving to the cloud helps you shift from a capital expenses (CAPEX) to an operational expenses (OPEX) model, since you are no longer paying for the
costs of a physical datacenter and its associated hardware and software. Instead you only pay for the resources you use on the cloud and can scale up or down as needed.

This can provide more cash flow flexibility across an organization.

### Resource constraints

### Business continuity

Moving to the cloud can help ensure security and resilience for business-critical workloads, as having dayto-day operations interrupted by issues like network connectivity and data loss can result in productivity
losses and increased risk of losing critical data.

Customers see a 66% reduction in recovery time on average for data hosted in Azure.

#### Resilient apps and operations

- By moving core business applications to the cloud, you can minimize
the amount of disruptions and more easily maintain operations, which
are often among the top concerns for organizations.
- By taking advantage of native disaster recovery and high availability
services, you can ensure that applications are not only resilient, but can
also scale up or down to meet performance demands.
- Azure provides options for replicating key workloads across different
regions, so their uptime is maximized, and built-in recovery options so
the risk of losing important apps or data is severely reduced, if not
eliminated entirely.


### Cybersecurity threats

The growing evolution of cybersecurity threats, increased need to protect people and resources wherever
they are located, and difficulty finding security talent has many security teams feeling overwhelmed. The
cloud provides a suite of comprehensive security options that can address many of their challenges.

#### Suite of cloud security solutions

- Traditional IT solutions are incapable of keeping up with the evolving threat
landscape of advanced cyber attacks, and many businesses feel more
vulnerable. The cloud offers built-in security solutions which provide
comprehensive protection against advanced threats.
- Azure is secured with a variety of physical, infrastructure, and operational
controls that allows organizations to take actions that ensure their applications
and data are protected, backed up, and compliant.
  - Azure Backup protects your environment from ransomware attacks and
recovers maliciously or accidentally deleted backup data.
  - Azure Security Center provides unified infrastructure security management
to protect your resources.
  - Azure Sentinel provides intellig
