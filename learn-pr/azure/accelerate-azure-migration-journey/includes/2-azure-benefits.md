Migrate to the cloud securely and efficiently—on your own terms.


## Increase performance

## Scale Applications and Workloads on demand

Increase agility with best-in-class Azure infrastructure that scales to your business needs.

## Reliability

Use built-in resilience to avoid costly business interruptions.

Reliability is and continues to be a core tenet of our trusted cloud commitments, alongside compliance, security, privacy, and transparency. Across all these areas, we know that customer trust is earned and must be maintained, not just by saying the right thing but by doing the right thing. Microsoft believes that a trusted, responsible and inclusive cloud is grounded in how we engage as a business, develop our technology, our advocacy and outreach, and how we are serving the communities in which we operate. Microsoft is committed to providing a trusted set of cloud services, giving you the confidence to unlock the potential of the cloud.

Design: How WE design our global fiber network, our evolving datacenters, and storage protections built into the Azure platform
Operate: How WE roll out releases into the environment, how we perform maintenance (planned and unplanned), and how we use machine learning to predict failures and protect customer workloads.
Observe: How CUSTOMERS can observe what’s happening in your environment(s), inform people and systems to make informed decisions before/during issues, and determine your own availability requirements.

High-availability network design. Unlike many other public cloud providers, data that traverses between Azure datacenters and regions doesn’t go through the public internet - it stays in Microsoft’s network. The reliability and performance of cloud services is determined in part by the network and (in addition to having more datacenter regions than any of our competitors) Microsoft’s network is also one of the largest in the world. The Microsoft global wide-area network (WAN) plays an important part in delivering a great cloud service experience – offering near-perfect availability, high capacity, and the flexibility to respond to unpredictable demand spikes. Azure traffic between our datacenters stays on our network and does not flow over the Internet. This includes all traffic between Microsoft services anywhere in the world. For example, within Azure, traffic between virtual machines, storage, and SQL communication traverses only the Microsoft network, regardless of the source and destination region. Intra-region VNet-to-VNet traffic, as well as cross-region VNet-to-VNet traffic, stays on the Microsoft network, giving us more control.

Expanding availability zones – Today, we have availability zones live in the 10 largest Azure regions, providing an additional reliability option for the majority of our customers. We are also underway to bring availability zones to the next 10 largest Azure regions between now and 2021.

Data/ Storage protection – During the September 2018 datacenter outage, several storage stamps were physically damaged, requiring their immediate shut down. Because it is our policy to prioritize data retention over time-to-restore, we chose to endure a longer outage to ensure that we could restore all customer data successfully. A number of you have told us that you want more flexibility to make this decision for your own organizations, so we are empowering customers by previewing the ability to initiate your own failover at the storage-account level.

Safe deployment practices – Azure approaches change automation through a safe deployment practice framework which aims to ensure that all code and configuration changes go through a cycle of specific stages. These stages include dev/test, staging, private previews, a hardware diversity pilot, and longer validation periods before a broader rollout to region pairs. This has dramatically reduced the risk that software changes will have negative impacts, and we are extending this mechanism to include software-defined infrastructure changes, such as networking and DNS.

Low to zero impactful maintenance – We’re investing in improving zero-impact and low-impact update technologies including hot patching, live migration, and in-place migration. We’ve deployed dozens of security and reliability patches to host infrastructure in the past year, many of which were implemented with no customer impact or downtime. We continue to invest in these technologies to bring their benefits to even more Azure services.

ML-driven failure prediction. We are using predictive techniques to determine when a server might fail so we can migrate virtual machines away from failing servers. It probably comes as no surprise we are using machine learning or what people call artificial intelligence to collect data and analyze them historically to learn the patterns that signal a server might be imminently failing. We apply this to disk failures, memory failures, and other types of hardware failures.

Service health alerts. aka.ms/AzureServiceHealth. Azure Service Health (in the Azure portal) provides tailored information for your resources. Strongly recommended for production systems.

Scheduled events. Azure Scheduled Events let you react to maintenance events before they impact your resources. 

Fault injection and stress testing – Validating that systems will perform as designed in the face of failures is possible only by subjecting them to those failures. We’re increasingly fault injecting our services and observing how they behave before they go to production, both at a small scale with service-specific load stress and failures, but also at regional and AZ scale with full region and AZ failure drills in our private canary regions. Our plan is to eventually make these fault injection services available to customers so that they can perform the same validation on their own applications and services.

Azure also provides you with high availability, disaster recovery, and backup solutions that can enable your applications to meet business availability requirements and recovery objectives. We maintain detailed guidance on designing reliable applications, including best practices for architectural design, monitoring application health, and responding to failures and disasters.


## Optimize costs

Save money with the most cost-effective offers for Windows Server and SQL Server. AWS is 5 times more expensive than Azure for Windows Server and SQL Server. Become energy efficient and sustainable by moving on-premises data centers to cloud.

Azure Hybrid Benefit is a licensing benefit that helps you to significantly reduce the costs of running your workloads in the cloud. It works by letting you use your on-premises Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server and SQL Server licenses on Azure. And now, this benefit applies to RedHat and SUSE Linux subscriptions, too.

AWS is 5 times more expensive than Azure for Windows Server and SQL Server.

Confidently migrate your data and workloads to Azure with best practices, expert guidance, and cost optimization tools.
