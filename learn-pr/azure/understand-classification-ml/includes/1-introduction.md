Classification models’ outputs are categorical, meaning they can be used for labelling inputs or decision making. For example, a self-driving car uses classification to decide whether to turn left or right at a fork in the road. This is different from classical regression models where outputs are continuous, such as the size of a shoe or the speed of a train. Classification models are diverse in how they work. To get started, we will focus on logistic regression, which is a simpler and popular type of model that is used extensively across many arms of science and industry.

## Scenario: Predicting avalanches with machine learning

Throughout this module, we’ll be using the following example scenario to explain concepts related to classification. This is designed to provide an example for how you might meet these concepts while programming yourself.

Your charity is responsible for avalanche-rescue operations at ski slopes and hiking trails across the north-west of the USA. While the safest option would be to permanently close all trails over the winter, that would mean no sportspeople would get to enjoy the great outdoors! Your goal is to build a model that can predict whether an individual day is likely to result in an avalanche, so that you can close the trail when the risk is high. You need to keep in mind as you do this that predicting avalanches that don't happen can hurt local tourism, while failing to predict avalanches that do happen can result in loss of life. Clearly, a balance must be found.

For those eager hikers and skiers out there: machine learning can be used for avalanche prediction, but the data for these exercises are completely fabricated and solely for educational purposes. Please don’t use this data or your trained model for anything except learning about machine learning.
