  title: Create and understand classification models in machine learning
  description: Classification means assigning items into categories, such labelling what is in an image, or predicting whether a team will be the winner or loser of a match. Classification can also be thought of automated decision making, such as whether to guide the driver using the motorway or side roads. Here we introduce classification models through logistic regression, providing you with a stepping-stone toward more complex and exciting classification methods.
