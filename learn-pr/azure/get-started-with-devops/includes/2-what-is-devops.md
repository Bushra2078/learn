Eager to share in the many benefits attributed to DevOps practices, organizations have often times been eager to adopt anything with DevOps in the title. This is common for buzzwords in our industry and our goal here is to provide some clarity around this term.

## A definition of DevOps

Ask 10 people for a definition of DevOps, and you'll get 10 different answers. At Microsoft, we have adopted the following definition from our Principal DevOps Manager on Microsoft's Cloud Developer Advocacy team, Donovan Brown.

> **DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.**

DevOps eliminates Development and Operation working in silos. It creates multidisciplinary teams that work together with shared and efficient practices and tools.

Some of the practices found in DevOps organizations include the following.

| | |
|-|-|
| **Agile planning** | Ensure a prioritized backlog of work is available for the team and facilitate management for work including user stories, bugs, and more |
| **Continuous Integration** (CI) | The process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control |
| **Continuous Delivery** (CD) | The process to build, test, configure, and deploy from a build to a production environment. |
| **Monitoring** | Use telemetry to deliver information about an applicationâ€™s performance and usage patterns to aid learning as we iterate. |

## What DevOps is not

When considering what DevOps is, it is also important to also ensure we understand what DevOps is not.

- DevOps is not a methodology
- DevOps is not a specific piece of software
- DevOps is not a quick-fix for an organization's challenges
- DevOps is not just a team or a job title (Although these are reasonably common in the industry)
