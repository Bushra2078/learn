Batch Transcription is a feature of Azure AI Speech. This service allows you to transcribe large amounts of audio into text quickly and accurately. Batch Transcription is especially useful for transcribing large volumes of call center audio data that is time-consuming and costly to perform manually. Batch Transcription can also increase accessibility in the workplace, in classrooms, and in the media given its ability to create subtitles.

Batch Transcription is available in over 90 languages and dialects and can be customized to overcome speech recognition barriers such as background noise, accents, and industry-specific terminology. These features make Batch Transcription ideal for organizations that serve multilingual markets or have worldwide workforces. Audio can be transcribed and translated from one language to another, making communication and understanding easier. You can get even more from your audio data by integrating Batch Transcription with other Azure services, such as Text Analytics, or *Azure Cognitive Search* for *Knowledge Mining*, to find the patterns in your data.

## Scenario - Managing a Call Center

Throughout this learning material, we refer to the following scenario to help illustrate the utility of Batch Transcription. The scenario is a typical use case but isn't intended to exhaustively cover all possible uses of Batch Transcription; we cover more use cases toward the end of this learning module.

Let's pretend you're a customer service call center manager. You're in charge of ensuring the company you work for is meeting compliance standards when interacting with customers. For example, you may need to ensure correct language has been used to obtain express consent for certain transactions to be undertaken. Auditing for compliance could be done manually. But, but listening to hundreds of phone calls a day to take note of any breaches requires much manual labor and is prone to errors due to the difficult nature of telephone data.

You've been tasked with identifying a solution to speed up this process and ensure your company is meeting standards with as few errors as possible. In this module, we go through the features and benefits of Batch Transcription to decide whether it's the right service for your needs.
