Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-accessible command-line experience for managing Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work, either Bash or PowerShell. Traditionally, to interact with Azure resources via command-line, you need to install the necessary components into your local computer (PC, Mac, Linux). With Cloud Shell, you have an authenticated, interactive shell that isn't part of a local machine.

You're an IT admin for Contoso Corporation, responsible for the cloud infrastructure on which the company hosts its applications. These applications use different cloud resources, such as Azure VMs, Azure blob storage, Azure networking, and others.

In some cases, you have a friend’s laptop, a smartphone, or another personal PC.
