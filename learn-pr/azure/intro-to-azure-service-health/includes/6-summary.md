<!-- 1. Goal and criteria-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Recap that this module's goal is 'evaluate' using the provided decision criteria.

    Format: Short text followed by a bulleted list of the decision criteria developed in the "When to use (product)" unit.

    Heading: none

    Example: "Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Logic Apps would be a good choice for your business process. We developed some criteria you can use to guide your decision:
    * Integration
    * Performance
    * Conditionals
    * Connectors"

-->
The goal of this module was help you understand the main capabilities of Azure Service Health and know how use to be aware on what is happening from the Azure platform side. So you have learned:

* What is Azure Service Health and their components
* The kind of information available by Azure Service Health
* How create alerts and be aware about issues and planned maintenance which may impact you

<!-- 2. Show how you solved the scenario problem(s)---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Briefly summarize how you applied the decision criteria to the scenario problem(s). Ideally, discuss two scenarios, one where the product was appropriate and one where it wasn't.

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "We applied these criteria to our fictional shoe company. The analysis helped us see how difficult it would be to use Logic Apps for each process. Both the social-media monitor and the video archive utility used only the built-in connectors. This characteristic made them perfect for Logic Apps. The online sales portal required more work because it had complex conditionals and needed custom connectors."

<!-- 3. Describe the business impact ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: explain how choosing the right product is important

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "The criteria help you evaluate whether your business processes are a good match for Logic Apps. First, they let you assess how well Logic Apps will solve your problem. Second, they give you an idea of the amount of customization effort involved in using them for your task. This process should give you enough information to choose the right product for your work."
