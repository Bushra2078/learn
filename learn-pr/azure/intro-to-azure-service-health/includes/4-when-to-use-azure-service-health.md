Failures of your cloud services will eventually happen and you must be ready for this eventuality. There are different ways to be ready and you should take advantage of the Azure Service Health capabilities.

As important as monitoring your virtual machines, security events, network connectivity, applications, databases, and so on, are, be aware that the health of your cloud platform should be a top priority.

On Azure, you have different tools to accomplish your monitoring strategy, that complements each other. Azure Service Health should be included in your monitoring toolset to allow you to be aware of any issues on the Azure platform.

As an example, if you can be alerted in advance, regarding a service issue on the datacenter where your virtual machines are running, you can be proactive and avoid issues within your workload. For this reason, you should consider using Azure Service Health to stay informed on service issues that affect you and the Azure deployments you have. The service is provided free.

The answer to the question about when to use Azure Service Health is, always use it. It doesn't matter if you have other tools to monitor the performance of your virtual machines or the health of your applications. Those tools will not be aware of planned maintenance at Azure datacenters. The Azure Service Health will be able to give this information to you.
