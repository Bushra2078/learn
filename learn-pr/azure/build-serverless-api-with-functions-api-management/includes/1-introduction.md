You can use Azure Functions and Azure API Management to build complete APIs with a microservices architecture.

Suppose you work for an online store that has built multiple Azure Functions. You have been asked to integrate these functions into a unified API to expose to partners. A visitor to the website store will need to be able to see products details and place orders.

You want to implement this system by using separate microservices such as:

- A product details service
- An order placement service
- An order shipping status service

In this module, you will learn how to use API Management to assemble multiple microservices, implemented as Azure Functions, into a single API.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify the value of API Management in a serverless application.
- Import Function Apps as APIs.
- Expose multiple Function Apps through a single API in API Management.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure API Management and Azure Functions
