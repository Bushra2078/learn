In this module, you published a serverless API with multiple Azure Functions apps and Azure API Management. This approach enables you to implement a microservices architecture by coding Azure Functions as serverless components. Use API Management to assemble these microservices into a single API product at a single URL with consistent behavior imposed by using API Management policies.
