## Module summary description
<!--LM: Global comment: The document contains variations on "Azure Sentinel Analytics" (often abbreviated to Analytics) and analytics rules, with varying capitalization and plural forms. This term is not available in our resources but based on similar terms, it might be Microsoft Azure Sentinel Analytics, with Azure Sentinel Analytics as the abbreviated form. It's not clear if you can use Sentinel Analytics or Analytics when referring to the service but I recommend including "Azure" for branding. When referring generically to analytics, please don't capitalize it and do use the plural form.-->
This module introduces you to Azure Sentinel Analytics and describes the various types of rules. You can create rules for detecting suspicious events either by using predefined templates or writing custom queries using Azure Data Explorer. There are a range of predefined analytics rules based on Machine Learning, Fusion, derived from the security products and you can also pull a community written rules from Security Community in GitHub.
<!--LM: Kusto Query Language and KQL are not approved terms. I replaced the term instances with Azure Data Explorer. Please update all instances of KQL.-->
## Subtasks in this module

- How to create a rule from custom template
- How to create a rule using your own Azure Data Explorer query
- How to manage the rules including editing and deleting

## Lab exercise

- Draft lab exercise title: Threat detection with Azure Sentinel Analytics <!--LM: I suggest "Detect threats with..."-->
  - Task 1: Create an incident analytics rule from existing template
  - Task 2: Create a scheduled query rule

## First unit: Introduction

**Type of unit:** Introduction unit

**Estimated unit duration:** 3 minutes

### Module scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a New York branch office. Contoso uses Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Azure AD Identity Protection, Cloud App Security, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, System Center Endpoint Protection, and Microsoft Azure Information Protection. Contoso provides threat protection for its Azure-based and on-premises resources by using the paid version of Azure Security Center. The company also monitors and protects other non-Microsoft assets.
Security analysts at Contoso face a huge triage burden. They deal with a high volume of alerts from multiple products. They correlate alerts in the following ways:

- Manually from different project dashboards
- By using a traditional correlation engine

Additionally, the time spent to set up and maintain IT infrastructure takes the security options (SecOps) team away from its security tasks.

The IT director believes that Azure Sentinel Analytics will help the security analysts perform complex investigations faster and improve their SecOps.

As Contoso's lead system engineer and Azure administrator, you've been asked to set up analytics rules in Azure Sentinel so that the SecOps team can identify and stop cyberattacks.
