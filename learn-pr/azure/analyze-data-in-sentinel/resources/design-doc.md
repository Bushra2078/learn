### Module scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Contoso has moved aggressively to Azure services, and it currently uses Microsoft 365 and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It also uses Azure AD Identity Protection, Cloud App Security, Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP), Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, Endpoint Protection, and Microsoft Azure Information Protection. Contoso is also using the paid version of Azure Security Center for threat protection for resources that are running on Azure and on-premises. Additionally, Contoso has other non-Microsoft assets to monitor and protect.
The IT director at Contoso realizes that its security analysts face a huge triage burden. They not only deal with a high volume of alerts, but they also must correlate alerts from different product dashboards manually or by using a traditional correlation engine.

The IT director believes that Azure Sentinel could provide a means to address Contoso's pain points:

- Alerts are from multiple products.
- Too many alerts are triaged across dashboards.
- The time spent setting up and maintaining IT infrastructure takes the security operations (SecOps) team away from its security tasks.

The IT director believes that Azure Sentinel Analytics will help the security analysts save time performing complex investigations and improve their SecOps.
As Contoso's lead system engineer and Azure administrator, you've been asked to set up an analytics rules in Azure Sentinel to improve the operation of SecOps team to identify and stop cyberattacks.x
