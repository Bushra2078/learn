### Module scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a New York branch office. Contoso uses Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Azure AD Identity Protection, Cloud App Security, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Endpoint Protection, and Microsoft Azure Information Protection. Contoso provides threat protection for its Azure-based and on-premises resources by using the paid version of Azure Security Center. The company also monitors and protects other non-Microsoft assets.
<!--LM: For "Endpoint Protection", please indicate System Center or Intune.-->
Security analysts at Contoso face a huge triage burden. They deal with a high volume of alerts from multiple products. They correlate alerts in the following ways:

- Manually from different project dashboards
- By using a traditional correlation engine

Additionally, the time spent to set up and maintain IT infrastructure takes the security options (SecOps) team away from its security tasks.

The IT director believes that Azure Sentinel Analytics will help the security analysts perform complex investigations faster and improve their SecOps.

As Contoso's lead system engineer and Azure administrator, you've been asked to set up analytics rules in Azure Sentinel so that the SecOps team can identify and stop cyberattacks.
