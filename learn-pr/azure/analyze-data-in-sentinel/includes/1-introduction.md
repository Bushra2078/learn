Azure Sentinel Analytics provides an intelligent analytics solution used in detection of potential threats and vulnerabilities in your organizations. With Azure Sentinel Analytics rules you can configure notification and alerts for your security connectors. These alerts will ensure that your SecOps team knows when a threat occur and how to properly react to prevent reaching your corporate asset.

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a New York branch office. Contoso uses several Microsoft products and services, to implement data security and threat protection for its resources. These products are:

- Microsoft 365
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Azure AD Identity Protection
- Cloud App Security
- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- System Center Endpoint Protection
- Microsoft Azure Information Protection

Contoso provides threat protection for its Azure-based and on-premises resources by using the paid version of Azure Security Center. The company also monitors and protects other non-Microsoft assets.
Security analysts at Contoso face a huge triage burden. They deal with a high volume of alerts from multiple products. They correlate alerts in the following ways:

- Manually from different project dashboards
- By using a traditional correlation engine

Additionally, the time spent to set up and maintain IT infrastructure takes the security operations (SecOps) team away from its security tasks.

The IT director believes that Azure Sentinel Analytics will help the security analysts perform complex investigations faster and improve their SecOps.

As Contoso's lead system engineer and Azure administrator, you've been asked to set up analytics rules in Azure Sentinel so that the SecOps team can identify and stop cyber attacks.
