The Analytics section in Azure Sentinel contains rule templates that are preloaded from the Azure Sentinel GitHub repository. You can use these templates to create a rule to detect security threats.

## Exploring the existing rule templates

You can use some of the existing rule templates to create a single rule and others to create multiple rules with different customization options. Templates that are in use display the **IN USE** label on the template page as displayed in the following screenshot.

By selecting one of the rules on the **Rule Template** tab, you can observe the properties of the rule. For each rule, you can view:

- Severity level. This indicates the importance of the alert. There are four severity levels:
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low
  - Informational
- Name of the rule. This provide a meaningful name for the alert rule
- Rule type. This defines the type of the rule which can be one of the following four types:
  - Fusion
  - Microsoft Security
  - ML Behavior Analytics
  - Scheduled
- Data Source. This specifies the data source connector that generated the alert
- Tactics. This specifies techniques and methodologies in MITRE ATT&amp;CK model used by different kinds of malware

> [!NOTE]
> MITRE ATT&amp;CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&amp;CK knowledge base provides a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cyber security product and service community.

When you select a rule name on the template page, the details pane on the right of the selected rule provides more information for the rule. Depending on the type of the rule that you select, the details pane can contain different fields of information. For Fusion and ML behavior analytics rules, Microsoft does not provide any additional information. However for scheduled rules, you can view the query rule used in the threat detection.

## Creating an analytic rule from a rule template

When you select a predefined rule template, the details pane provides the **Create rule** button. By selecting this button, you can create an analytics rule from that template. The composition of the analytics rule built from the template depends on the rule type that you select.

By default, Azure Sentinel Analytics creates an alert rule using the Fusion rule template. For ML behavior analytics, you can only create a rule as enabled or disabled, and you do not have the option to further customize the rule.

A rule you create from the Microsoft security templates consists of the following elements:

- **Name**. This is prepopulated from the name of the rule template.
- **Description**. This provides more details on the creation of the alerts.
- **Status**. This indicates whether the analytics rule is enabled or disabled.
- **Analytic rule logic**. This indicates the source of the alert from one of the Microsoft security services.
- **Filter by severity**. Use to tune alerts from a source based on the severity level, which can be High, Medium, Low, or Informational.
- **Include specific alerts**. Use to filter alerts that contain a specific text in their name.
- **Exclude specific alerts**. Use to filter alerts that do not contain a specific text in their name.

The following screenshot presents an example of creating an incident from alerts generated by the Azure Security Center.

The Creating an Analytics rule from the wizard unit that follows describes how to create an analytics rule from a scheduled template rule type.

> [!NOTE]
> For certain rule templates, the **Create rule** button might be disabled, which indicates that you cannot create a rule from selected template due to a missing data source.
