  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Because of ongoing maintenance activity, you need to stop receiving alerts from analytic rules temporarily. Which action should you enable on the rule to achieve that configuration? "
    choices:
    - content: "Delete"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Delete action will permanently stop receiving alerts from the analytic rule."
    - content: "Disable"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Disabled rules keep all the configuration, and will temporary stop creating the alerts from the configured detections, while the rule is disabled."
    - content: "Duplicate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Duplicating the rule will have the same logic as the original analytic rule and will continue to generate the alerts."
  - content: "What will be the most efficient way to tune existing analytic rule?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete and recreate the alert with the new logic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Deleting the analytic rule will require more effort to build the same query logic and tune accordingly."
    - content: "Duplicate the rule and modify the necessary changes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you duplicate the rule, you have the startup configuration provided from the original rule, which you can further modify."
    - content: "Create a new rule."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You will need to create a new analytics rule to provide more inputs to achieve the required customization, instead of simply duplicating the rule."
