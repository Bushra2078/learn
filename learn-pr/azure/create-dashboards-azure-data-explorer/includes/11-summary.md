In the scenario, you wanted to share visual data insights with a colleague. You created a dashboard with several visualizations to communicate these insights. Then you created a parameter to allow for interactive use of the dashboard, and created a cross-filter for this parameter. You used these parameters to filter the results displayed on the dashboard. You then manipulated permissions to share this dashboard with others.
