Dashboards are an excellent way to communicate data science insights visually.

You've connected to resources containing a meteorological dataset. In this unit, you'll create a dashboard from a query of this data. 

## Pin query to dashboard

Start with a query that you want to pin to the dashboard. In this case, you'll share a plot of events versus time from the publicly available help cluster.

1. Run the following query:

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | summarize Count = count() by bin (StartTime, 8h)
    | render timechart
    ```

1.  At the top right corner of the query editor, select **Share** > **Pin to dashboard**.

1. Select **Pin** to create the pin and view the dashboard.

## Return to your dashboard

If you've exited the dashboard itself, you can return to the dashboard menu by selecting **Dashboards (Preview)** from the left pane, and then selecting the specific dashboard you wish to view.
