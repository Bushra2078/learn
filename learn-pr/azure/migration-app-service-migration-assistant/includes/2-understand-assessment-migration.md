In this unit, we'll review the potential challenges you may encounter when migrating web applications hosted on-premise in your own server at a high level.  We'll provide context on the kinds of dependencies that web applications have on features of Internet Information Services and why this causes a problem. This critical background information provides the context you may need to better understand the need for an assessment.

## Why move a web application to Azure App Services?

Azure App Services is a fully managed platform for your web apps that allows you to run and scale your web apps with minimal setup. Microsoft manages the infrastrcture, operating system updates, and handles load balancing and scale-up / scale-down logic as needed. While you can configure settings in a simplified user interface and can explore the performance of the application as it runs, there's relatively little else to do on your part.  This makes Azure App Services a very attractive alternative to running your applications in your own server environment where you must deal with hardware costs, setup, operating system installation, update and configuration, server software installation, updates and configuration, and so on.

## What is the Azure App Service Migration Assistant?

The Azure App Service Migration Assistant is part of a larger suite of applications that help organizations with their transition to the cloud.  The Azure App Service Migration Assistant provides a guided wizard-like user experience that performs two tasks:

1. It performs an assessment of a specific web app installed on Windows Server.  It evaluates the dependencies of the web app to determine whether or not a migration to Azure App Services is possible without modification to the web app.
2. If the assessment proves that the web app can be migrated, the Migration Assistant will perform the migration.  You'll need to provide the Migration Assistant with access to your Azure account, select which Resource Group you want to use, select a name for the web app, and other similar details.

Alternatively, the Azure App Service Migration Assistant generates an ARM Template which you can use to migrate the web application in a more automated and repeatable fashion.

## Why perform an assessment?

In some organizations, web applications were originally built with the assumption that the application would always have access to low-level features of Internet Information Services. For example, some developers built features like monitoring, logging, and security on top of ISAPI filters which provides access to incoming requests before they are passed to the ASP.NET application, and access to outgoing responses after they are generated by the ASP.NET application.

However, one of the benefits of using a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering like Azure App Service is that the cloud provider (Microsoft, in this case) manages the hardware and software for you so you don't have to, which is where the cost and time savings come from.  However, this means that your applications will have access to fewer of the lower-level features of Windows Server and Internet Information Services.  If your applications depended on these lower-level features, you may not be able to take advantage of Azure App Service without modification.  

### What types of issues does the assessment check for?

TODO: I'll write a sentence or two about each of these based on the link, below.

"Readiness checks"

- Port bindings
- Protocols
- Certificates
- Location tags
- ISAPI Filters
- Application Pools
- Application Pool Identity
- Authentication Type
- Application Settings
- Connection Strings
- Frameworks
- Configuration Error
- Virtual Directories

### What if the assessment finds a problem?

If the Azure App Service Migration Assistant finds issues when assessing your web application, this doesn't mean you have no options. You can:

- Update the application to replace features that are dependent on lower-level extensibility features of Internet Information Services.  This could be relatively simple depending on the functionality in question.  For example, you could replace the custom logging features that were dependent on an ISAPI filter with Azure Application Insights. Application Insights requires only a few lines of code be added to an application and provides a wealth actionable reports.
- Deploy the application "as is" to an Azure Virtual Machine. While you would not gain the benefits of using Azure App Services and would be required to maintain the operating system, you would no longer need to maintain the hardware, and you would have a single point of management for all your web services.
