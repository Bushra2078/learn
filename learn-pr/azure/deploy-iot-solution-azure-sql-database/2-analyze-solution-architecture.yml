  questions:
  - content: "In the typical IoT solution mentioned, what is the purpose of warm storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "Optimized storage for large data volumes at a reasonable cost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cold storage should be optimized for large data volumes at a reasonable cost."
    - content: "Perform real-time streaming for capturing low latency events."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Event processing has this purpose."
    - content: "Persist low latency events and messages that need to be ingested efficiently at a high rate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Manage bi-directional communications with devices, like queuing events and messages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The cloud gateway has this purpose."      
  - content: "What is the advantage of using Azure SQL Database for IoT scenarios?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure SQL Database can ingest millions of events per second and while querying ingested data with sub-second latency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure SQL Database can ingest millions of events per second if configured properly. However, that's not the only advantage."
    - content: "Azure SQL Database can integrate with other services including Azure Functions and Azure Stream Analytics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure SQL Database can integrate with Azure Functions and Azure Stream Analytics, but that's not the only advantage."
    - content: "Azure SQL Database supports real-time analytics, you can configure up to 30 read-only replicas if needed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  "The Hyperscale tier supports up to 30 named replicas for read-scale, but that's not the only advantage."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Azure SQL Database is great for IoT because it can scale, integrate, and support real-time analytics."
