  title: Deploy IoT solutions with Azure SQL Database
  description: In this module, you will deploy a baseline IoT solution that leverages Azure SQL Database as the backend database. First, you'll analyze the solution architecture and how it can be used for IoT solutions. Next, you'll deploy the solution template and configure the device simulator. Finally, you'll implement, monitor, and react to a workload, using tools like Azure Functions, Azure IoT Hub, and dashboards.
