The Global Expansion team needed a speech translation service that could be integrated into a mixed reality collaboration tool to enable communication across its global workforce.

You integrated the Azure Cognitive Services Speech Translation service into a mixed reality experience to deliver real-time speech translation in a target language. Without speech translation, the language barrier contributed to miscommunication and lack of inclusion. With the integration of speech translation, the team members can converse with one another and view translated text in the app's UI.
