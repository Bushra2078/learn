# Note for reviews:
#
# Learn Live uses the modules format to provide instructions to the audience
# who is following the live sessions.
# The content structure and the requirements are different from Learn modules.
# We are in the process of defining a separate content model for Learn Live to standardize our modules.
# 
# All Learn Live "modules" are hidden and are not meant to be found when searching
# for Learn content.
