summary: | 
  As a senior .NET developer working for a real estate business, you are part of an experienced in-house development team and your technology stack is Microsoft's .NET.
  You are running a website built with ASP.NET Core MVC and SQL Server.
  It is running on-premises on your own hardware. You have plans to expand the business.
  This will lead to increased numbers of users hitting the current web application. 
  You conclude that the expansion plans require to scale-up hardware to handle increased workload and ensure fast response times.
  Because of high cost related to these investments, you consider a migration of the solution into the cloud.
  Because of the positive experience with the Microsoft stack in the past you feel comfortable moving to Azure as your cloud provider and expect a smooth transition.
  Pushing the application to Azure will help mitigate both, the cost and time factor of upgrading the on-premises solution.
