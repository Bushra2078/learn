Learn Live is part of [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn) where you find a thoroughly designed micro-learning experience, combined with a hands-on approach that helps you arrive at your goals faster, with more confidence and at your own pace. 

## Series overview

Our first series is titled "Migrate an ASP.NET Core application from an on-premises environment into Azure". We have created a scenario where we assume that you are a .NET developer working on an in-house system, and now it is time to make a move into the cloud. You work for a fictitious company called VanArsdel Ltd. VanArsdel is in the real estate business, and as part of this, they run a beautiful website where they are selling real estate property.

There is a deployed version of the application available at [vanarsdel-realestate.azurewebsites.net](https://vanarsdel-realestate.azurewebsites.net).

## Use the Microsoft Learn Live Sandbox to get free access to Azure resources

We use Azure throughout this series to create resources like Azure App Services, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Storage. Some of these resources are available for free while others are paid offers. To follow along with our series, you have two options.

- Option 1: Use your Azure subscription and clean up unused resources manually if you no longer need them, to avoid unintended costs. This gives you the benefit of having a persisted environment from the first all to the last session of our series. It also allows you to use all the features of Azure.
- Option 2: Use our Microsoft Learn Live Sandbox. The sandbox provides you with a concierge subscription and a temporary resource group. The sandbox deletes itself after four hours. You do not have to pay anything for using the sandbox. It is entirely free. The sandbox offers most of the Azure features needed for this series. Some resources, however, are not available. If a feature is unavailable in the sandbox, we call it out explicitly during the delivery of the session. You will find instructions how to activate the sandbox in the session preparation steps.
