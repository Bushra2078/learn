Great work! In this module, you learned about accelerating your application modernization journey using Azure Migrate App Containerization by containerizing and migrating an Java web application to Azure App Service. You containerized and migrated the Java web application, Airsonic, that was running on a Linux machine to Azure App Service using the App Containerization tool.  

App Containerization tool is a standalone tool that can be run on any Windows machine. The tool can remotely connect to a Linux server machine that's running your Java web web application, that you're looking to containerize and migrate to AKS or Azure App Service. The tool will identify the components that need to be packaged together into the container image and generate a Dockerfile that can help you build out that container image. Further, you can also use the Azure Container Registry based build feature to build that container image and push it to your Container Registry. The tool will then generate the Kubernetes manifest files that are needed to get that application deployed on AKS. The customizations built into every step along the way can help you parameterize app configurations, store and manage application secrets using Azure Key Vault, and even helps you move app contents to AKS persistent volumes. The tool generated artifacts such as Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifest files can be downloaded, saved and further used for day two operations. 


## Clean up resources
In this module, you created resources by using your Azure subscription. The following steps show you how to clean up these resources so that there's no continued charge against your account.

1. Go to the Azure portal.
2. In the left menu, select Resource groups.
3. Select the resource group name that starts with *LearnAppContainerization* or the resource group name you used.
4. On the Overview tab, select Delete resource group.
5. To confirm the deletion, enter the name of the resource group. To delete all the resources you created in this module, select Delete.
