You work as a network engineer for a large telecommunications company. Your company has recently started exploring the use of cloud technology to improve their services and reduce costs. Your team has been tasked with finding a solution to deploy and manage Container Network Functions (CNF) and Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) in your on-premises environment. The company wants to have more control over the deployment and management of these workloads, while still being able to take advantage of the benefits of the Azure public cloud.

You have heard about Azure Operator Nexus and are curious if it can help solve your company's problem. You need to learn more about the platform's architecture, deployment options, and edge and disconnected solutions to determine if it's the right fit for your company's needs.
