As a sales engineer for a cloud technology company that provides solutions to telecommunications operators, you understand the importance of selling transformation to the CTO or CTIO level. The potential client you're meeting with is a large telecommunications company struggling with managing their on-premises network functions and looking for a solution that can help them deploy and manage Container Network Functions (CNF) and Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) more efficiently. This is a risk-averse purchaser who is focused on resiliency and security, as they support emergency national services and critical national infrastructure.

To convince the client that Azure Operator Nexus is the right fit for their business, you plan to present the platform's integrated systems architecture, deployment options, and edge and disconnected solutions. You understand that these are experienced purchasers who go through many evaluations and want to understand the journey and roadmap. Therefore, you aim to be there earlier in the process, working with the CIO to demonstrate the value of Microsoft and help them fundamentally transform the way they deliver their services.

With Azure Operator Nexus, they'll have access to a subset of IaaS and PaaS services available in the Azure public cloud to deploy network-intensive workloads in their data center and edge locations, while automating the lifecycle management of the infrastructure. This won't only improve their services but also reduce costs.

## Learning objectives
After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe Operator Nexus integrated systems architecture.
- Explain Operator Nexus deployment options.
- Describe edge and disconnected solutions.
