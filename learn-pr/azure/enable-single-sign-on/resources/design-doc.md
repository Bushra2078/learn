# Title

Enable single sign-on for applications by using Azure Active Directory

## Role(s)

Administrator

## Level

Intermediate

## Product(s)

Azure Active Directory

## Prerequisites

- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a free account.
- One of the following roles in the Azure AD tenant: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator
- A single sign-on enabled subscription for the application

## Summary

Define the URLs that are necessary for secure access, create a signing certificate, and configure single sign-on properties for the application. When the user attempts to sign in, the appropriate URLs are accessed to enable them to use the same credentials to sign in to all the applications they need.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this module, the learner will be able to configure Azure Active Directory and applications to enable users to sign in once to access all the applications they need.

1. Identify an application that supports SAML-based single sign-on and add it from the application gallery to their Azure AD tenant.
2. Configure the appropriate single sign-on URLs needed in the Azure AD tenant. URLs and a certificate will also be gathered for configuring the application at the host.
3. Configure the application properties for single sign-on at the host of the application.
4. Test the single sign-on experience by using test user accounts.

## Outline the units

Add more units as needed for your content

1. Introduction

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job task that shows how the technology is used in practice:

    Suppose youâ€™re an IT administrator at a retail company that depends on many applications for users to complete their work, such as marketing, sales, and operations. A team asked for a new application to be added to help with company promotion. The application needs to be made available to team members as appropriate.

    You realize that this addition causes users to sign in to yet another application using specific credentials for it. Users get frustrated because they have to sign in many times a day depending on the applications they use. You want to be able to configure the system so that a user can sign in once and get access to all applications and resources that they need to work effectively.

1. Identify enterprise applications that support SSO

    - Search for an application in the gallery
        - Navigate to Enterprise applications in the Azure portal
        - Search for the application and verify SSO support
    - Identify the SSO methods that the application supports
        - Select the application in the gallery to view overview
    - Add the application to the Azure AD tenant
        - Click Create

    Knowledge check

    How does an administrator know which SSO methods an application supports?
    - Find the information on the overview page in the gallery.
    - Find the information on the applications list page in Enterprise applications.
    - Contact the owner of the application and ask what methods are supported.

1. Exercise - Add an SSO supported enterprise application

    List the steps that apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Go to the Azure Active Directory Admin Center and sign in using one of the roles listed in the prerequisites.

1. Summary

    We wanted to make sure that users in our organization only need to sign in once to their Azure AD tenant and then access all applications that they need, instead of signing in to each application individually.

    By configuring SSO in the tenant by using the Azure portal, we can define all of the URLs and the certificate that are needed for secure access. We also configured the application at its host to be able to securely connect to application using the user accounts that we created and assigned.

    Tested the SSO experience that was configured.

## Notes
