# Title

Enable single sign-on for applications by using Azure Active Directory

## Role(s)

administrator

## Level

intermediate

## Product(s)

Azure Active Directory

## Prerequisites
- An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a free account.
- One of the following roles in the Azure AD tenant: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator
- A single sign-on enabled subscription for the application 


## Summary

Define the URLs that are necessary for secure access, create a signing certificate, and configure single sign-on properties for the application. When the user attempts to sign in, the appropriate URLs are accessed to enable them to use the same credentials to sign in to all the applications they need.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this module, the learner will be able to configure Azure Active Directory and applications to enable users to sign in once to access all the applications they need.

1. Upon completion of this unit, an administrator will be able to configure the appropriate single sign-on URLs needed in the Azure AD tenant. URLs and a certificate will also be gathered for configuring the application at the host.
2. Upon completion of this unit, an administrator will be able to configure the application properties for single sign-on at the host of the application.
3. Upon completion of this unit, an administrator will be able to test the single sign-on experience by using test user accounts.
