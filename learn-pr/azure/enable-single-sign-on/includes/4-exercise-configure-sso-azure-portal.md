In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to configure single sign-on properties for an application in the Azure portal.

To configure single sign-on for the application in the Azure portal:

- Define the URLs that are used to access the application
- Define any attributes or claims that are needed by the application
- Download a SAML signing certificate

## Define URLS

Define values for the following single sign-on properties in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using one of the roles listed in the prerequisites.
1. Select **Identity**, and then select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** box, select **Edit**.
1. Specify the **Identifier (Entity ID)**. For this application the identifier is `https://samltoolkit.azurewebsites.net`.

    A value is provided that follows a suggested pattern. Each application in the gallery has a unique set of suggested patterns for URLs.

1. Specify the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)**. The value entered at this point in the configuration process is only temporary, you will come back to this property and revise the value. For this application, the URL is `https://samltoolkit.azurewebsites.net/SAML/Consume`.
1. Specify the **Sign on URL** - Used to perform service provider-initiated single sign-on. This value is the sign-in page URL for your application. This field is unnecessary if you want to perform identity provider-initiated single sign-on.

1. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** box, select **Download for Certificate (Raw)** to download the SAML signing certificate and save it to be used later.

1. You may be asked to verify the download, if so, select **Keep**.
