Register the user account at the service provider that matches the account that was created at the identity provider, and then configure single sign-on for the account.

## Register a new user account

Matching accounts must be created at both the identity provider and the service provider. Some applications in the gallery can be configured directly, but others require a request be made to the application support team to do the configuration.

In this module, the **Azure AD SAML Toolkit** application represents an application that was requested by a team in the organization to help with productivity. This application has been set up to allow the administrator to register user accounts and configure single sign-on without having to contact the support team.

To register a user account with the **Azure AD SAML Toolkit** application:

1. Open a new browser window and browse to the sign-in URL for the application. For the **Azure AD SAML Toolkit** application, the address is `https://samltoolkit.azurewebsites.net`.
1. Select **Register** in the upper right corner of the page.

1. For **Email**, enter the email address of the user that will access the application. For example, the user account that was created that uses the address of `contosouser1@contoso.com`. Be sure to change `contoso.com` to the domain of the Azure AD tenant where the application is located.
1. Enter a **Password** and confirm it.
1. Select **Register**.

## Configure single sign-on
