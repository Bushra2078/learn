Employees are typically expected to use many applications to accomplish tasks. When the employee is required to sign-in to each of the applications individually, frustration rises and productivity suffers. When an administrator sets up single sign-on, the employee only has to sign in once to access all the applications they need.

## Example scenario

Suppose youâ€™re an IT administrator at a retail company. The company depends on many applications for users to complete tasks, such as marketing, sales, and operations. A team asked for a new application to be added to help with company promotion. The application needs to be made available to team members as appropriate.

You realize that this addition causes users to sign in to yet another application using specific credentials for it. Users get frustrated because they have to sign in many times a day. You want to be able to set up the system so that a user can sign in once and get access to all applications they need.

## What will we be doing?

Single sign-on is a trust relationship between an identity provider and a service provider. When a user signs in to an application, the authentication process creates one or more tokens that enable secure identification.

For single sign-on, a combination of tasks are required both in the identity provider and at the service provider. User accounts need to exist in both locations, a certificate is created and shared, and URLs must be shared between both for a trusted relationship. Testing single sign-on is very important before introducing the application with single sign-on enabled to the employees.

## What is the main goal?

Upon completion of this module, the learner will be able to create a trust relationship between the identity provider and the service provider to enable users to sign in once to access all the applications they need.
