Employees are typically expected to use many applications to accomplish tasks. When the employee is required to sign in to each of the applications individually, frustration rises and productivity declines. When an administrator sets up single sign-on for applications, the employee only has to sign in once to access all the applications they need.

## Example scenario

Suppose youâ€™re an IT administrator at a retail company. The company depends on many applications for users to complete tasks, such as marketing, sales, and operations. A team asked for a new application to be added to help with company promotion. The application needs to be made available to team members as appropriate.

You realize that this addition causes users to sign in to yet another application using specific credentials for it. Users get frustrated because they have to sign in many times a day. You want to make it so that a user can sign in once and get access to all the applications that they need.

## What will we be doing?

Single sign-on is a trust relationship between an identity provider and a service provider. When a user signs in to an application, the authentication process creates one or more tokens that enable secure identification.

For single sign-on, a combination of tasks is required both at the identity provider and at the service provider. For a trusted relationship, user accounts need to exist at both locations, a certificate is created and shared, and URLs must be shared between both. Testing single sign-on is important before introducing the application with single sign-on enabled to the employees.

## What is the main goal?

Upon completion of this module, the learner will be able to create a trust relationship between the identity provider and the service provider. This relationship enables users to sign in once to access all the applications they need.
