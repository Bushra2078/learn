  title: 'Knowledge Check'
  questions:
    - content: 'What is the DataFrame method call to create temporary view?'
      choices:
        - content: createOrReplaceTempView()
          explanation: This is the correct method name for creating temporary views in DataFrames
          isCorrect: true
        - content: createTempView()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect method name
        - content: createTempViewDF()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect method name
    - content: 'How do you create a DataFrame object?'
      choices:
        - content:  An object is created by introducing a variable name and equating it to something like myDataFrameDF =
          explanation: This is the correct way of creating DataFrame Objects.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Using the createDataFrame() function
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: There is no such method for creating a DataFrame.
        - content: DF.create()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect syntax and wrong way to create DataFrame Objects.
    - content: 'Why do you chain methods (operations) myDataFrameDF.select().filter().groupBy()?'
      choices:
        - content: To avoid the creation of temporary DataFrames as local variables
          explanation: You could have written the above as - tempDF1 = myDataFrameDF.select(), tempDF2 = tempDF1.filter() and then tempDF2.groupBy().This is syntatically equivalent, but, notice how you now have extra local variables.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: it is the only way to do it
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect, you could have split the line into 3 calls.
        - content: to get accurate results
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect, even if you split the calls into 3 lines, the result is accurate, it just wastes unnessessary memory allocations.
    - content: 'What is the DataFrame equivalent of the SQL statement SELECT count(*) AS total?'
      choices:
        - content: .agg(count("*").alias("total"))
          explanation: This is the correct syntax in DataFrames to produce the same result as the SQL statement above.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: .select(count("*").alias("total"))
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect syntax
        - content: .select(agg("*").alias("total"))
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect syntax
    - content: 'What is the Python syntax for defining a DataFrame in Spark from an existing parquet file in DBFS??'
      choices:
        - content: IPGeocodeDF = spark.read.parquet("dbfs:/mnt/training/ip-geocode.parquet")
          explanation: This is the correct syntax to accommplish the task .
          isCorrect: true
        - content: IPGeocodeDF = parquet.read("dbfs:/mnt/training/ip-geocode.parquet")
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect syntax
        - content: IPGeocodeDF = spark.parquet.read("dbfs:/mnt/training/ip-geocode.parquet")
          isCorrect: false
