Modern applications require a strong foundation that's built on a modern database like Azure SQL Database.

## Example scenario

Getting the timing right of heading to the bus stop is a challenge that most can relate to. More often than not, you either end up waiting for the bus or running to catch the bus and missing it. Throughout this module and the associated learning path, you'll follow the scenario (and the development of a solution) of catching the bus.

## What will we be doing?

You'll break down a scenario for an application and build a multi-service architecture of a solution, which is based on the microservices approach. Getting into the details after building the architecture, you'll dive into the first crucial step: building the foundation for a modern application. Using Azure SQL Database, you'll deploy, configure, and automate CI/CD for the database component of your full stack application.

## What is the main goal?

Learn how to use modern application and database capabilities to build a foundation for applications.
