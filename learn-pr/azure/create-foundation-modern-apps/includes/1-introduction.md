Modern applications require a strong foundation built on a modern database like Azure SQL Database.

## Example scenario
Getting the timing right of heading to the bus stop is a challenge that most can relate to. More often than not, you either end up waiting for the bus or running to catch the bus and missing it. Throughout this module and the associated learning path, you will follow the scenario (and the development of a solution) of catching the bus.

## What will we be doing?
Here, you'll break down a scenario for an application and build a multi-service architecture of a solution which is based on the microservices approach. Getting into the details, you'll dive into the first crucial step: building the foundation for a modern application. Using Azure SQL Database, you'll deploy, configure, and automate CI/CD for the database component of your full stack application.

## What is the main goal?
Learn how to leverage modern application and database capabilities to build a foundation for applications.
