## Summary 
This tutorial taught you to build a Mixed Reality experience that demonstrates UI elements, 3D model manipulation, model clipping, and eye-tracking features. The tutorial provided you with NextButton and PreviousButton objects which let you explore the 3D model viewer experience. ClippingObjectButton lets you turn on clipping objects and experience the clipping feature. The tutorial also provided you with an eye-tracking element to highlight the tooltips in the experience.
 
You also learned how to create a Holographic Remoting remote app and connect to HoloLens 2 at any point, providing a way to stream your 3D content and visualize it in Mixed Reality.
