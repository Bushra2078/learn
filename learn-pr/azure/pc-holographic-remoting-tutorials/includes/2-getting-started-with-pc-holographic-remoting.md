# 2. Getting Started with PC Holographic Remoting

## Spatial Awareness 
Spatial Awareness supplies a set of meshes that represent the environment's geometry, allowing for engaging interactions between holograms and the actual world. In Mixed Reality applications, the Spatial Awareness system delivers real-world environmental awareness.

## Interactable scripts
Objects with interactable scripts respond to a variety of input interaction states. The scripts support a variety of themes that let you alter object parameters--for example, color, size, material, or the shader--that affect visual states.
