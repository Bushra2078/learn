## 2. Getting Started With PC Holographic Remoting

## Spatial Awareness 
Spatial Awareness supplies a set of meshes that represent the environment's geometry, allowing for engaging interactions between holograms and the actual world. For example, in Mixed Reality applications, the Spatial Awareness system delivers real-world Environmental Awareness.

## Interactable Scripts
Objects with interactable scripts respond to a variety of input interaction states. In addition, the scripts support various themes that let you alter object parameters--for example, color, size, material, or the shader--that affect visual states.
