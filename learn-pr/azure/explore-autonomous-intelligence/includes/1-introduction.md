We define **Autonomous Intelligence** as a set of AI technologies that are components of the Machine Teaching new AI paradigm, together with Automated Intelligence which includes control theory, optimization algorithms and expert systems. The AI technologies in Autonomous Intelligence are Machine Learning algorithms for advance perception (computer vision, any other sensory classification, and prediction) and Deep Reinforcement Learning.   Automated Intelligence powered by AI are key components to further optimise industrial machinery and processes by sensing and responding in near real time. Systems containing Autonomous Intelligence can make human-like decisions on their own. Autonomous Intelligence systems are suited to a dynamic environment because they learn by trial and error in simulation the best way to act in different scenarios and are flexible. While Autonomous Intelligence systems can be creative and adaptable, they are also black-box systems. In this module, we evaluate the use of Autonomous Intelligence methods discussing their pros and cons and how they fit together with Automated Intelligence to create intelligent systems.
