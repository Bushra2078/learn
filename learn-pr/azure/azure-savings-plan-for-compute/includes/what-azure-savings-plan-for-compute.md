Azure savings plan for compute is a new pricing model where eligible customers, such as your company, commit to an hourly amount of money to be spent on select Azure compute services in exchange for lower prices. The plan provides you a convenient and flexible way to save up to 65% on the cost of compute services, compared to pay-as-you-go prices. Depending on your choice, the plan applies over a one-year or a three-year period. You can also choose to pay the full commitment amount upfront or to pay monthly at no extra cost. 

As you use select compute services, their respective charges are covered by the plan at reduced prices, helping you get more value for your money. The savings apply automatically across compute usage regardless of region, instance series, or operating system. You designate the resources covered by the plan by setting its scope to a subscription, resource group, management group or your entire account. The highest savings automatically apply first, allowing you to get the most value from your hourly commitment. If the current usage exceeds that commitment, you are billed at your regular pay-as-you-go prices. Savings plans provide cost benefits and donâ€™t affect the runtime state of your resources.
