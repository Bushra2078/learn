You can use tools in Azure to continuously monitor your applications and infrastructure.

A financial organization is moving its systems to Azure, with a mixture of IaaS and PaaS services. In its previous environment, the organization had several instances where systems failed or issues arose. There was an extended delay to engage resources and resolve the issues. This situation affected customers' ability to access their accounts, and it influenced satisfaction. 

The organization wants to design a monitoring strategy that encompasses all the solutions that it uses. There should also be insights and alerting into the accumulated log data. The organization wants to quickly identify and minimize the impact if systems fail in the future.

In this module, you'll explore the monitoring solutions available in Azure. You'll assess services such as Azure Security Center, Azure Application Insights, and Azure Sentinel, to analyze infrastructure and applications. You'll also explore how Azure Monitor is used to unify various monitoring solutions.

By the end of this module, you'll design a continuous monitoring strategy for your infrastructure and applications.
