## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Design a holistic monitoring strategy on Azure*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    A financial organization is moving their systems to Azure, a mixture of IaaS and PaaS services. They have had several instances in their previous environment where systems failed, or issues arose, and extended delay to engage resources and resolve the issue occurred. This impacted customers ability to access their accounts, and has hurt customer satisfaction. They want to design a monitoring strategy that encompasses all solutions they use, provides insights and alerting into the log data they accumulate, and ensures they can quickly identify and minimize impact if and when systems fail in the future.

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

## Notes

This one may not have a ton of interactivity, but should be focused on selecting the right services, how each plays into an overall monitoring strategy, and integrating them together to create a solid monitoring strategy.
