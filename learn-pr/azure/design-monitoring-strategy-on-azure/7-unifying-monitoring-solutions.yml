  questions:
  - content: You need to write queries to analyze your log data. How would you do this?
    choices:
    - content: Use the Log Analytics agent to write your queries.

      explanation: You can create and run queries on your logs and view results with Log Analytics.
    - content: Use a workspace to write your queries.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Workspaces are where your data is stored. Use Log Analytics to write your queries.
  - content: How can you automatically collect security-related data from all newly created virtual machines into one central location?
    choices:
    - content: Use the Log Analytics agent.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The agent gathers security-related information from resources into a workspace.
    - content: Use an instance of Application Insights.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Application Insights is used to collect information about your application's health.
    - content: Use a cross-resource query.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Use the Log Analytics agent. You use cross-resource querying to analyze the log data collected from separate workspaces. 
  - content: How can you analyze both security-related data and application performance data together?
    choices:
    - content: Use the Log Analytics agent to query Azure Security Center and Application Insights workspaces together.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Use a cross-resource query. The agent gathers security-related information from resources into a workspace.
    - content: Use a cross-resource query to query Azure Security Center and Application Insights workspaces together.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You use cross-resource querying to analyze the log data collected from separate workspaces. 
    - content: Use automatic provisioning to query Azure Security Center and Application Insights workspaces together.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Automatic provisioning will install the Log Analytics agent on virtual machines. Use cross-resource querying to analyze the log data collected from separate workspaces.
