  - content: Where should DevOps teams implement application monitoring to improve application health and performance?
    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Monitoring only during development limits problematic code from being deployed but doesn’t provide visibility when the app is live in production.
    - content: In production only
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Monitoring only during production provides visibility in to live issues but doesn’t reveal problems and errors during development, QA, and test phases.
