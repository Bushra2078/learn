  questions:
  - content: Where should DevOps teams implement application monitoring to improve application health and performance?
    choices:
    - content: During development only 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Monitoring only during development limits problematic code from being deployed, but doesn't provide visibility when the app is live in production.
    - content: In production only
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Monitoring only during production provides visibility in to live issues, but doesn't reveal problems and errors during development, QA, and test phases.
    - content: During development and while in production
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! Monitoring applications in development prevent errors and exceptions later in production. By monitoring applications in production, you'll promptly identify problems and risks that affect users.
  - content: Which Azure capability offers operations teams a pre-defined monitoring experience across multiple resources?
    choices:
    - content: Azure Monitor Application Insights
