      explanation: You can analyze and address issues such as exceptions, failures, and availability problems.
  - content: How can you continuously monitor your applications from different geographic locations?
    choices:
    - content: Use availability tests to continuously monitor your application from different geographic locations.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Availability tests let you monitor your application from multiple locations in the world.
    - content: Use an instrumentation key to continuously monitor your application from different geographic locations.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You use availability tests to continuously monitor your live web application. Instrumentation keys are for using an instrumentation package. 
    - content: Use Log Analytics to continuously monitor your application from different geographic locations.

  - content: How would you continuously monitor your release pipelines?
    choices:
    - content: Use availability tests to monitor your release pipelines.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Use a continuous monitoring gate to monitor release pipelines. Use availability tests to monitor your application's performance once it's live.
    - content: Use a continuous monitoring gate to monitor release pipelines.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Use the gate to stop deployment when an issue has been identified. Deployment will continue automatically when the issue has been resolved. 
    - content: Use the application map to monitor your release pipelines.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The application map gives you a typology of your application and doesn't monitor your pipelines. Instead, use a continuous monitoring gate to monitor release pipelines.
