Serverless architecture makes use of the cloud infrastructure so you don't have to provision, manage, scale, or maintain any machinery or networks. Azure Functions is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) offered by Microsoft Azure to implement serverless architecture. Azure Functions is a fully scalable, resilient, reliable, and secure service.

Let's say you're a senior web developer in a research role for an online luxury watch dealer. You're building a website based on Azure Web Apps, and you've been asked to provide new functionality that involves creating individual methods that can be deployed, manually executed, scheduled, or even triggered by other Azure services.

The company has a test-driven development process, so you're also required to write automated unit tests for new services. You have a team of developers who are well-versed in Microsoft technologies, including the .NET framework and Visual Studio. You decide to investigate the use of Azure Functions to meet your requirements.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build and test an Azure function locally using Visual Studio 2019, and deploy the function to Azure from Visual Studio.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Develop an Azure function in Visual Studio 2019
- Test and debug an Azure function in Visual Studio 2019
- Deploy an Azure function directly from Visual Studio 2019 to Azure
- Manage Azure Functions code

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure Functions
- Experience developing solutions in Visual Studio or a similar integrated development environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exercises in this module require a local installation of Visual Studio 2019 (hereafter referred to as Visual Studio) in a Windows environment.
