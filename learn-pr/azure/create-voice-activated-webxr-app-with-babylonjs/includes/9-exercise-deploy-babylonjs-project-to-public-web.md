Azure Blob Storage allows developers to serve static content on the web by storing the source files in the *$web* container.

Recall that in the scenario of the amusement park application, we need to make the Babylon.js WebXR application available on the public web.

In this exercise, you'll use Azure Blob Storage to serve the amusement park application as a public static website. Make sure to select the appropriate WebXR Session Type from the tabs above before proceeding to the exercise.

## Build the web project

Before jumping into hosting the website, we must first package our Node.js web project into a folder of static files.

1. If you don't already have a terminal open in VSCode, select **Terminal** in the menu of Visual Studio Code, and then select **New Terminal** to create a new terminal.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/select-new-terminal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Terminal dropdown menu in Visual Studio Code. The New Terminal option is surrounded by a red box.":::

1. Within the terminal, make sure that you are in the **starter-code** folder, which should be the folder that you edited.
1. Run `npm run-script build` in the terminal to package the project into static files.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/terminal-npm-build.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of the N P M build command in a Visual Studio Code terminal.":::

1. After the command finishes running, you should see a folder named *dist* created in the root folder of the project.

## Create a storage account

Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) and make sure that you're using the same account that you used to create the Azure Speech resource.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.
1. After landing on the **Marketplace** page, in the **Search the Marketplace** box, type **storage account** and press the Enter key.
1. Select **Storage Account** from the results.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/marketplace-storage-account.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Azure Marketplace results. There's a red box around the Speech service.":::

1. On the page for the Storage Account resource, select **Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    ***Project details***

    |Field  |Value  |Details  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |**Subscription**    |   Concierge subscription      |    The resource you're creating must belong to a resource group. Here, you select the Azure subscription to which the resource group belongs or will belong, if you're creating the resource group within the wizard.     |
    |**Resource group**     |   <rgn>[Sandbox resource group]</rgn>      |    The resource group to which the Speech service will belong. All Azure resources must belong to a resource group.     |

    ***Instance details***

    |Field  |Value  |Details  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |**Name**     |    Enter a unique name     |   Choose a globally unique name for the resource. For example, you might name the resource *webxrmagicxxx*, where the x's are replaced with your initials or a series of numbers. If the name isn't globally unique, you can try any other combination. Valid characters are a-z and 0-9. The name must be 3 to 24 characters long and will be used to generate the public URL for accessing data in the account.      |
    |**Region**     |    Geographical location near you     |   The geographical location where your app will be used.      |
    |**Performance** | Standard | This option decides the type of disk storage used to hold the data in the Storage account. Standard uses traditional hard disks, and Premium uses solid-state drives (SSD) for faster access. |
    |**Redundancy** | Geo-redundant storage (GRS) | In the case of a regional unavailability, the data in the storage account will still be present and accessible thanks to redundancy in other regions. Keep "Make read access to data available in the event of regional unavailability" checked. |

    :::image type="content" source="../media/create-storage-account.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of values for creating a storage account on Azure portal":::

1. Select **Review + Create**.

1. Once the validation completes, select **Create** to create the storage account.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few seconds to get the storage account created and ready for use. A notification will appear after deployment is complete.

## Enable Static Website Hosting

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **All resources**.

1. Select the storage account from the list.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/all-resources-storage-account.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the list of all resources. There's a red box around the Web X R dash magic dash spell resource.":::

1. In the **Data management** section, select **Static website**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/select-static-website.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Speech service resource page. There's a red box around the menu item Keys and Endpoint.":::

1. Toggle the Static website switch to **Enabled**, and put **index.html** as the **Index document name**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/static-website-settings.PNG" alt-text="Settings page for the static website hosted using Azure Blob Storage":::

1. Select **Save**.
1. After the settings are applied, you will see the default URLs provided for your website. Copy and save one of the URLs somewhere so that we can access the website later.
