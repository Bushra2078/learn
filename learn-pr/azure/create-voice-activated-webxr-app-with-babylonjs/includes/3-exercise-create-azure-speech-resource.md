Azure Speech-to-text allows us to transcribe voice audio to text accurately without the need to implement our own model.

In order to use the Azure Speech-to-text service in the amusement park application, we must have an Azure Speech Resource as well as a subscription key to access the API from the code.

Here, you will create an Azure Speech Resource in the Azure portal and retrieve the subscription key from there.

## Create a Speech service resource

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.learn.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) by using the same account that you used to activate the sandbox.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**. Everything you create on Azure is a resource.
1. The portal takes you to the **Marketplace** page. In the **Search the Marketplace** box, type **speech** and press the Enter key.
1. Select **Speech** from the results.

1. On the page for the Speech service resource, select **Create**.
1. Fill out the wizard with the following values:

    |Field  |Value  |Details  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |**Name**     |    Enter a unique name     |   Choose a globally unique name for the resource. For example, you might name the resource *webxr-magic-spell-xxx*, where the x's are replaced with your initials. If the name isn't globally unique, you can try any other combination. Valid characters are a-z, 0-9, and -.      |
    |**Subscription**    |   Concierge subscription      |    The resource you're creating must belong to a resource group. Here, you select the Azure subscription to which the resource group belongs or will belong, if you're creating the resource group within the wizard.     |
    |**Location**     |    Geographical location near you     |   The geographical location where your app will be used.      |
    |**Pricing tier**     |     Free F0    |    The pricing tier of the plan being created. The selected tier corresponds to the usage of the resource. The Free F0 tier currently provides five audio hours free per month for Speech Translation.    |
    |**Resource group**     |   <rgn>[Sandbox resource group]</rgn>      |    The resource group to which the Speech service will belong. All Azure resources must belong to a resource group.     |

1. Select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take a few seconds to get your Speech service resource created and ready for use.

A notification will appear after deployment is complete. Your new Speech service resource and API keys will then be available for use.

## View the subscription keys and endpoint

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **All resources**.
1. Select the Speech service resource from the list.

In later exercises, you'll need the values for **KEY 1** and **LOCATION** as you call the Speech-to-text API using the JavaScript SDK.
