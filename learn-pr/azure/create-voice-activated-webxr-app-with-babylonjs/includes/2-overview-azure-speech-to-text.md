Speech-to-text is a technology that accurately converts voice audio to text data in real time. It has become the underlying technology that supports most voice-related systems today. For example, our voice is converted to text whenever we speak to a virtual assistant. The system then process the text data to determine next steps for the virtual assistant. Speech-to-text also powers real-time transcription to make live videos or meetings more accessible to people with hearing impairments.

In the scenario of the amusement park application, we can use speech-to-text to recognize magic spells. When a user says the spell, the speech-to-text service converts the audio data to text. Then, the app can match the transcribed text against the text representation of the expected spell to see if the user has said a certain spell.

Here, you will learn about how the Azure Speech Services can help achieve the flow described above.
