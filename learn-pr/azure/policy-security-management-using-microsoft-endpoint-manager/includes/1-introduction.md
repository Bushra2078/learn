Microsoft Endpoint Manager uses groups to assign policies, such as conditional access policies and endpoint security policies. To control access to your organization's resources, such as email, files and data, you can use a conditional access policy. Conditional access makes sure that only trusted users can access organizational resources on trusted devices using trusted apps. You can assign endpoint security policies to help provide security for your organization's devices and mitigate risk.

Intune uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups to manage devices and users. You can set up groups to suit your organizational needs. Create groups to organize users or devices by geographic location, department, or hardware characteristics. Use groups to manage tasks at scale.
