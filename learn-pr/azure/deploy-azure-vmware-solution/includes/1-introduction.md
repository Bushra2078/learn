<!--Add a sentence or two that explains what Azure VMware solution is/does. Could grab text from Intro to Azure VMware Solution module.!-->

Imagine you work for a healthcare company who runs production workloads on a VMware platform. IT operations are spread between different offices. There are a few trends that have surfaced in recent months. Some locations have equipment nearing end of life, so hardware refresh decisions need to be made soon. Additionally, your company isn't able to get new infrastructure quickly enough to meet requests for hardware refreshes and new applications. The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take at least 4 to 6 months, if not longer. Your company has decided to migrate existing VMware workloads to Azure VMware Solution. By using Azure VMware Solution, your company doesn't have to change virtualization platforms or alter existing operational patterns. 

In this module, you'll learn how to plan, deploy, and connect Azure VMware Solution to your existing VMware infrastructure on-premises.
