  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: When you try to deploy Azure VMware Solution, you receive an error stating "NoRegisteredProviderFound." What should you try next?
    choices:  
    - content: Try to redeploy and see if the same error message displays.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Redeploying AVS won't help your AVS environment as the error is about a separate configuration component.
    - content: Register Microsoft.AVS resource provider for the subscription.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: To deploy AVS, the Microsoft.AVS resource provider must be registered with the subscription for deployment.
    - content: Try deploying Azure VMware Solution in a different region.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Switching regions won't help your deployment as the error doesn't relate to a regional issue.
  - content: If you can't connect to your Azure VMware Solution environment from on-premises, what configuration step should you take?
    choices:  
    - content: Delete Azure VMware Solution deployment and redeploy service.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Redeploying the service with the same configuration won't ensure you have network connectivity to your on-premises VMware environment.
    - content: Ensure all gateways, including the ExpressRoute provider's service, support 4-byte Autonomous System Number (ASN).
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: AVS uses 4-byte public ASNs for advertising routes between the on-premises ExpressRoute and the AVS ExpressRoute.
    - content: Check permissions on the subscription and resource group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: If you're able to deploy AVS, you already have the right permissions assigned.
  - content: When you try to deploy Azure VMware Solution, you receive an error message highlighting there are steps to take before node deployment. How do you resolve the error so you can continue with the deployment?
    choices:  
    - content: Use a different region.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Picking a different region will result in the same error message. There's a step you forgot before deploying your AVS environment.
    - content: Check permissions on the subscription and resource group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: If you're able to deploy the service without issues, you already have the right permissions assigned.
    - content: Open up a new support ticket to have quota allocated.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: To deploy AVS, you must open up a support request so your bare metal hosts are provisioned in your subscription.
  - content: "At a minimum, which CIDR network address block does Azure VMware Solution private clouds require?"
    choices:
    - content: "/22"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "AVS needs a /22 CIDR network address block for IP segments."
    - content: "/30"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "AVS needs a bigger CIDR network address block allocated for IP segments."
    - content: "/31"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "AVS needs a bigger CIDR network address block allocated for IP segments."
  - content: "What type of interconnectivity provides network connectivity into Azure resources and services?"
    choices:
    - content: "Full interconnectivity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Full interconnectivity establishes connectivity between on-premises VMware environment and AVS."
    - content: "Half interconnectivity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not a valid type of interconnectivity for AVS configuration."
    - content: "Basic interconnectivity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Basic interconnectivity establishes connectivity between the bare metal hosts and Azure resources."
  - content: "What is one of the gateways deployed with AVS?"
    choices:
    - content: "NSX-T Tier-1 gateway"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "AVS deploys with an NSX-T Tier-1 gateway in Active/Standby mode. The NSX-T Tier-0 and Tier-1 gateways connect network segments as logical switches and provide East-West and North-South connectivity."
    - content: "Application Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. This is not deployed with AVS."
    - content: "Virtual network gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A virtual network gateway is a PaaS resource that routes tables and runs specific gateway services for site-to-site connectivity. This is not deployed with AVS."
