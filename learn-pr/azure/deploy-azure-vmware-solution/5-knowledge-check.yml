  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: When you try to deploy Azure VMware Solution, you receive an error stating "NoRegisteredProviderFound." What should you try next?
    choices:  
    - content: Try to redeploy and see if the same error message displays.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Redeploying AVS will not help your AVS environment as the error is about a separate configuration component.
    - content: Register Microsoft.AVS resource provider for the subscription.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: In order to deploy AVS, the Microsoft.AVS resource provider must be registered with the subscription for deployment.
    - content: Try deploying Azure VMware Solution in a different region.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Switching regions will not help your deployment as the error does not relate to a regional issue.
  - content: If you can't connect to your Azure VMware Solution environment from on-premises, what would be a good configuration step to take or inspect?
    choices:  
    - content: Delete Azure VMware Solution deployment and redeploy service.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Redeploying the service with the same configuration will not ensure you have network connectivity to your on-premises VMware environment.
    - content: Ensure all gateways, including the ExpressRoute provider's service, support 4-byte Autonomous System Number (ASN).
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: AVS uses 4-byte public ASNs for advertising routes between the on-premises ExpressRoute and the AVS ExpressRoute.
    - content: Check permissions on the subscription and resource group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: If you were able to deploy AVS, you already have the right permissions on the private cloud.
  - content: When you try to deploy Azure VMware Solution, you receive an error message highlighting there are steps to take before node deployment. How do you resolve the error so you can continue with the deployment?
    choices:  
    - content: Use a different region.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Picking a different region will result in the same error message. There's a step you forgot before deploying your AVS environment.
    - content: Check permissions on the subscription and resource group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: If you were able to try and deploy the service without issues, you have the right permissions already assigned.
    - content: Open up a new support ticket to have hosts allocated.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: In order to deploy AVS, you must open up a support request so your bare metal hosts are allocated to your subscription.
