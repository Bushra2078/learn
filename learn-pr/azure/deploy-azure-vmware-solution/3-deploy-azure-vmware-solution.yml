    choices: 
    - content: "Virtual Machine Contributor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual Machine Contributor lets you manage virtual machines, but not access to them, and not the virtual network or storage account they're connected to. This role will not allow you to deploy AVS."
    - content: "Owner"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Owner role gives the user full access to all resources in the subscription, including the right to delegate access to others. This role will allow you to deploy AVS. But it may give you more access than you need to the subscription."
    - content: "Contributor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "At a minimum, AVS requires Contributor level access to the subscription for successful deployment."
  - content: "Which planning step is required to deploy Azure VMware Solution in the Azure portal?"

    - content: "Register the Microsoft.AVS resource provider."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Before you can provision your hosts, make sure that you register the Microsoft.AVS resource provider in the Azure portal."
    - content: "A service principal"
