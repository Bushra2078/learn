  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which resource is required to configure ExpressRoute peering on the Azure VMware Solution private cloud to on-premises?"
    choices:
    - content: "Customer provided ExpressRoute"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "AVS deploys with an ExpressRoute circuit that connects you into Azure from the bare metal hosts. Additionally, a customer provided ExpressRoute is required to establish full connectivity into AVS from on-premises for migrations."
    - content: "Application Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. This is not required to peer the AVS environment to on-premises."
    - content: "Network virtual appliance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A network virtual appliance (NVA) is a virtual appliance that primarily performs network functions through virtualization. This appliance isn't required to peer the AVS environment to on-premises."
  - content: "In order for on-premises network traffic to reach Azure VMware Solution, which component is required?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Virtual private network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A virtual private network provides site-to-site connectivity over the public internet. AVS requires dedicated site-to-site connectivity."
    - content: "ExpressRoute Global Reach"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ExpressRoute is a dedicated site-to-site circuit and Global Reach allows you to connect AVS private cloud ExpressRoute circuits to an on-premises VMware environment. Without Global Reach, the ExpressRoute Gateway doesn't provide transitive routing between its connected circuits."
    - content: "Load Balancer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure load balancer provides high availability by distributing incoming traffic among healthy VMs. This is not required for on-premises network traffic to reach AVS."
