quiz:
  questions:
  - content: When you try to deploy the Bicep file above, Bicep gives you an error. What should you do to resolve the problem?
    choices:
    - content: Add a tag to the module path.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The module path doesn't currently include a tag, so Bicep can't find the correct module file to use. Change the module path to something like `br:toycompany.azurecr.io/mymodule:v1`.
    - content: Sign in to Azure Container Registry.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Bicep uses the sign-in details from the Azure CLI when it accesses the registry.
    - content: Add a module alias.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A registry alias enables you to simplify the name of the registry in the module path, but it isn't required and won't resolve the error.
  - content: You've created a Bicep file that will be useful to people throughout the Bicep community. What's the best way to share it?
    choices:
    - content: Publish it to a private registry.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A private registry is designed to be used within your organization.
    - content: Publish it as a template spec.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Because a template spec is stored in your Azure subscription, it's only accessible within your organization.
    - content: Publish it to the public registry.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Microsoft maintains a public registry for the Bicep community. Anyone can submit and use modules.
  - content: In which of these situations should you publish a new version of your module to  a private registry?
    choices:
    - content: You add some comments to your module.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Comments in a Bicep file don't affect how the module behaves, so you don't need to publish a new version of the module.
    - content: You remove a mandatory parameter from the module.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. When you modify mandatory parameters for a module, this is a breaking change. You should publish a new version of the module.
    - content: You need to share your module with a colleague.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to publish a new version of your module to share it with your colleagues. Instead, grant them access to the registry.
