Your organization had an urgent need for a new and scalable website. Your developers didn't have time to learn a new web stack or coding language, but you wanted to host the website in Azure to ensure that it's highly available and easy to scale. You used a language and framework your team was already comfortable with to build the webapp quickly and Azure App Service can host this code without any extra configuration or software. 

To implement a website on-premises requires hardware and the skills to set it up and configure it for scalability, availability, and security. The Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) architecture of Azure App Service enables you to leave these issues to Microsoft engineers. You can concentrate on building your Node.js application and use Visual Studio Code to deploy it rapidly and easily.
