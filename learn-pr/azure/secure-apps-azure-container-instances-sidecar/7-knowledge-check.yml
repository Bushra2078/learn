  questions:
  - content: "What Azure Container Instance feature can you use to perform initialization tasks required by your application?"
    choices:
    - content: Other Azure Container Instances running in parallel
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Init containers are better suited, since the application containers will always wait for the init container(s) to finish before starting."
    - content: Init Containers
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Init Containers are always run before application containers. They can be used to perform initialization tasks or make sure that application requirements are fulfilled."
    - content: Modify the application code to perform initialization
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While modifying the application is a possibility, init containers offer a much more modular approach."
  - content: "How do sidecar containers communicate with the main application container?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sidecar containers can communicate with other containers in the same container group using 127.0.0.1 as the destination IP address."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Sidecar containers, or containers running in the same container group, share the same IP address and networking stack"
    - content: "Sidecar containers can use the DNS to find out the address of others containers in the container group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not required, since all containers in a container group share the same networking stack"
    - content: "Not possible, because containers in a container group are isolated from each other."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Containers in a container group share the same networking stack, and can communicate with each other."
  - content: "Which images can be used for sidecar containers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sidecar containers can be created from the same image as the main application container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sidecar containers in one container group can be instantiated from completely different container images."
    - content: "Sidecar containers can be created from any container image from any image repository."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Containers in one container group can be instantiated from completely different container images, even from different repositories"
    - content: "Sidecar containers can be created from any container image, but all containers in the container group need to be instantiated from the same image repository."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Containers in one container group can be instantiated from different image repositories."
  - content: "Which IP address will an Azure Container Instance receive when deployed in a Virtual Network?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Azure Container Instance will receive a private IP address in the subnet where it is deployed and a public IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure Container Instance will only receive a private IP address, but no public IP address."
    - content: "The Azure Container Instance will receive a public IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure Container Instance will receive a private IP address in the subnet where it is deployed."
    - content: "The Azure Container Instance will receive a private IP address in the subnet where it is deployed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Azure Container Instance will be fully integrated in the Virtual Network."
  - content: "From where can Azure Container Instances deployed in a Virtual Network be accessed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only from inside the Virtual Network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Other peered Virtual Networks and on-premises networks can access the Azure Container Instance too."
    - content: "From inside the Virtual Network and from other peered Virtual Networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "On-premises networks can access the Azure Container Instance too."
    - content: "From inside the Virtual Network, from other peered Virtual Networks, and from on-premises network connected over VPN or ExpressRoute."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Container Instances deployed in Virtual Networks have the same connectivity as other resources such as virtual machines."
