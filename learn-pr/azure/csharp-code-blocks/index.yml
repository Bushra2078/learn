summary: Use code blocks with more confidence, understanding how they impact the visibility and accessibility of both higher and lower-level constructs in your code.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Understand the impact of declaring and initializing variables inside and outside of code blocks.
  - Remove code blocks in `if` statements when there's only one line of code in the body of the code block to improve readability.
  - Identify namespaces, classes, and methods in your code.
  - Understand how moving methods into new classes, and classes into new namespaces impacts the visibility of the code.
  - Understand the use of the `using` statement to instruct the compiler where to look for classes referenced in your code.
prerequisites: |
  - Experience declaring and initializing variable values
  - Experience with the `if-elseif-else` statement
  - Experience calling methods of classes in the .NET Class Library
