In this module, you learned if the MEAN stack was a good choice for your web development needs. To demonstrate the MEAN stack, you created a new Ubuntu Linux virtual machine in Azure and installed the MEAN stack on it for web development:

- MongoDB for a data store.
- Express for web request routing.
- AngularJS for client-side web application functionality.
- Node.js for server-side web application functionality.

With your MEAN stack environment in place, you created a simple book inventoryÂ web application to run a working application on your Linux VM.
