In this module you learned how to grant secure access to your Blob Storage account so users of your application could upload images without the need for you to maintain a middleware application.

Achieving that required several steps:

* You needed to grant access to your Blob Storage Account to your users
* You couldnâ€™t share your Storage Account Keys so you decided to use SAS
* SAS needed to be generated on demand and delivered to your Static Web App
* An Azure Function API was the right way to generate SAS keys on demand and deliver them to your Static Web App

Shared Access Signatures are the way to go when you need to provide secure and on demand access to your cloud resources. An Azure Function was the best way to created SAS keys on demand while at the same time reducing the maintenance costs of running cloud software, removing middleware, and letting Azure handle the task of running a backend service for you. In this way you offered a fast storage solution to your users by leveraging Blob Storage, and allowed your developers to focus on the application development, instead of maintaining legacy image upload middleware.
