The [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en*us/services/bot*service/), combined with [Microsoft QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/), provide the tools developers need to build and publish intelligent bots that interact naturally with users using a range of services. In this lab, you will create a bot using the Azure Bot Service and connect it to a knowledge base built with QnA Maker. Then you will interact with the bot using Skype â€” one of many popular services with which bots built with the Azure Bot Service can integrate.

### What's covered in this lab?
In this lab, you will
* Create an Azure Web App Bot to host a bot
* Create a knowledge base, populate it with data, and connect it to a bot
* Implement bots in code and debug the bots that you build
* Publish bots and use continuous integration to keep them up to date
* Debug bots locally using Visual Studio Code and the Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator
* Plug a bot into Skype and interact with it there
