Microsoft Defender for IoT provides comprehensive threat detection for IoT/OT environments, with multiple deployment options that include cloud-connected, fully on-premises, or hybrid environments.

This module describes the steps required to deploy Defender for IoT for operational technology (OT) monitoring.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a car manufacturer that has offices and production sites across the globe. You're tasked with implementing a system to monitor traffic and secure your manufacturing automation systems (Operational Technology), from the access panels to the pneumatic and packaging systems. To take your organization's OT security visibility to a whole new level, your team chooses to use Microsoft Defender for IoT.

You’ve been tasked with installing Defender for IoT software on your new OT sensors. You have an activation file from an onboarded OT sensor, and the list of your sensor’s required endpoints. You now need to download the Defender for IoT software and save it in a location accessible from your sensor machine. You’ll run the installation. Then, use your activation file to complete your deployment and connect your sensor to Azure.


## What will we be doing?

In this module you'll complete the following tasks:

- **Install monitoring software**: install the ISO file on the sensor.
- **Set up the interface**: Define the interface settings for each sensor end point to be monitored.
- **Activate the sensor**: Run the activation file and assign security signatures.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to deploy and activate your OT sensor to start sending data to Microsoft Defender for IoT.
