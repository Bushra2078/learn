  questions:
  - content: "The pg_azure_storage extension provides many capabilities for working with data files in an Azure Blob Storage account. Which of the following functionality is NOT available through the extension?"
    choices:
    - content: "Export table data to a blob"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The pg_azure_storage extension allows you to work with data in a blob storage account, but it doesn't allow you to export table data into blobs."
    - content: "List the files in a blob storage container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The pg_azure_storage extension allows you to list the files in a blob storage container."
    - content: "Import file data directly into a table using the COPY command"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The ability to ingest data directly from files is a key feature of the pg_azure_storage extension. The extension uses the COPY command to extract data from files in blob storage and write it directly into tables in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL."
  - content: "One of Woodgrove Bank's developers created a new distributed table named user_actions but is unavailable to answer questions you have about it. Which query will provide you with details about the table and its distribution column?"
    choices:
    - content: "SELECT * FROM pg_tables;"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The pg_tables view contains details every table in your database. This data includes schema name, table name, and information about indexes, rules, triggers, and row-level security. It doesn't, however, provide distribution details about tables."
    - content: "\\dt"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. \\dt displays a list of all tables in the database, but it doesn't provide distribution details for tables."
    - content: "SELECT * FROM citus_tables;"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The citus_tables view displays information about distributed tables in your database, including the table name, size, and distribution column."
  - content: "Woodgrove Bank has requested that to add a new extension to their Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL database. Which query should be run to confirm the requested extension is supported and view the most up-to-date list of supported extensions?"
    choices:
    - content: "SELECT * FROM pg_extension;"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The pg_extension view shows the extensions that are currently installed."
    - content: "SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! the pg_available_extensions view lists the extensions that are available for installation."
    - content: "\\dx"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. \\dx provides a list of installed extensions."
