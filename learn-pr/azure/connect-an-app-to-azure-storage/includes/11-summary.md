## Summary

In this module, you have looked at design considerations when assessing if Azure Storage accounts are right for your app. Networking connectivity design constraints can significantly add to the complexity of your app. In addition, we took into account availability of client libraries for your language or platform, which can significantly increase productivity.

We then looked at how to obtain and use the required configuration to connect to your Azure Storage account. We created a client from that configuration that was able to connect to the storage account, and create a container if one by that name did not already exist.

This provides the basis for your app to utilise Azure Storage for your apps requirements.
