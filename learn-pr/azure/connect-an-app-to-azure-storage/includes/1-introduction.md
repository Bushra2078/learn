# Motivation
You are wanting to develop an application that uses some form of storage to store your apps data. The data is very important and you would like to ensure that the storage system used is fast, reliable and robust. In addition, you would like to ensure it is fully backed up and secure, without having to know or build all those aspects into the storage system. You just want it to work.

Azure Storage provides such power, resiliency and performance in the cloud. This module will provide you with the knowledge to be able to utilise the power of Azure Storage to achieve the reliability and performance in your app that you require. This knowledge can then can be applied to any application.

## Short Abstract
Install required libraries with appropriate confiuguration to access Azure Storage and connect to an Azure Storage account.

## Long Abstract
Azure Storage is a fast, robust and flexible Storage mechanism in the Azure cloud. In this module, you will learn how to create a new console application referencing the necessary libraries to work with Azure Storage. You will then learn how to use the Azure Storage security keys within your apps configuration so that you can write code to connect the App to your Azure Storage account.
