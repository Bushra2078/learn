### Module scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company with its headquarters in London and offices in New York and San Francisco. Contoso computing environment is hosted exclusively in its on-premises data centers, with majority of workloads fully containerized on Kubernetes, running on a third-party virtualization platform. Despite its fully modernized environment, Contoso is facing challenges imposed by capacity and agility constraints inherent to on-premises infrastructure. In addition, it also becomes increasingly difficult to manage in a consistent manner continually growing number of Kubernetes clusters. 

To address the capacity and agility challenges, Contoso's IT management decided to migrate a significant portion of its containerized workloads to cloud. Weary of developing a single-vendor dependency, Contoso wants to leverage multiple cloud providers, although it is considering choosing Microsoft Azure as its main deployment target. This consideration is heavily influenced not only by the advantages of the Azure Kubernetes Service offering, but also by a wide range of hybrid benefits associated with Azure Arc, with its centralized, multi-platform management capabilities playing the primary role.

Since Azure Arc is still in preview, the Contoso IT Engineering team was tasked with exploring and evaluating its capabilities in regard to Kubernetes-based workloads. It is your responsibility, as the lead system engineer to determine how Contoso can benefit from its hybrid management model while pursuing a multi-vendor strategy and maintaining some on-premises containerized workloads.
