Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL can grow with the demands of the apps that rely on it. Woodgrove Bank has expanded their app and operations to Europe, bringing a larger user base and more demand for access to transactions all the time. As a database administrator at Woodgrove Bank, you had to address growth in usage and demand. By scaling the resources and rebalancing the data, you were able to handle the growth in the number of users and transactions. By creating a read replica, you were able to address the needs of the European analysts by getting them a read-only dataset located in their region, allowing for quick performance for analysis without impacting the users. By enabling high availability, you have set them up to access their data with minimal downtime. Overall, the Woodgrove Bank app has been set up to thrive with Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.
