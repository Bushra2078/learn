    - content: "Scale vCores."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "RAM is tied to vCores."
    - content: "Scale storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. RAM isn't tied to storage."
    - content: "Scale IOPS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. IOPS are scaled with storage."
  - content: "How many read replicas can Woodgrove Bank have?"
    choices:
    - content: "Five read replicas per region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. There are considerations for read replicas to know when working with them."
    - content: "As many as they need - there's no limit."

      explanation: "There's a limit of five read replicas for a primary cluster."
  - content: "High availability is enabled on the Woodgrove Bank cluster. One of the worker nodes is experiencing issues. Based on this information, when should you expect the node to fail over?"
    choices:
    - content: "Immediately on error"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "After the fourth failed health check"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "After four failed health checks, a node is declared down and failover is triggered."
    - content: "When the whole cluster fails"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. High availability is handled at the node level."
