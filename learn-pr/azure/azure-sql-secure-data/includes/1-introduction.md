Ensuring security and compliance of your data is always a top priority. In this module, you'll learn how to use Azure SQL to secure your data, how to configure logins and users, how to use tools and techniques for monitoring security, how to ensure your data meets industry and regulatory compliance standards, and how to leverage the extra benefits and intelligence that is only available in Azure. We'll also cover some of the networking considerations for securing SQL.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you should be able to:  

* Make an informed decision regarding securing your network
* Managed and deliver access management and authorization  
* Protect, encrypt, and mask data
* Manage and monitor security for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance

## Prerequisites for exercises  

* Experience working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server
* Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources

For the exercises, a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, you need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

* Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)  
* Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true)
* Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?azure-portal=true)
* Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.

If you cannot complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
