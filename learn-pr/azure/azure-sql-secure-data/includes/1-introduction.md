Ensuring security and compliance of your data is always a top priority. In this module, you'll learn how to use Azure SQL to secure your data, how to configure logins and users, how to use tools and techniques for monitoring security, how to ensure your data meets industry and regulatory compliance standards, and how to leverage the extra benefits and intelligence that is only available in Azure. We'll also cover some of the networking considerations for securing SQL.

Note that this is the third module in the Azure SQL Fundamentals learning path. It is recommended to complete the Azure SQL introduction module before continuing here.

Throughout the exercises, it's important to also read the accompanying text to the steps, but know that you can always come back to this page to review what you did at a later time.  

In this module, the following topics will be discussed:  

* Platform and network security
* Access management and authorization  
* Information protection and encryption  
* Security management  

## Prerequisites for exercises  

If you intend to complete the exercises (recommended), a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, you do need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

* Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)  
* Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Download the zip file which includes some of the lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.  
* TODO TBD MAY NEED TO ADD OSTRESS TO PATH?  

If you cannot complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
