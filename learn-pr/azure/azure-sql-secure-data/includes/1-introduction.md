Ensuring the security and compliance of your data is always a top priority. In this module, you will:
* Use Azure SQL to secure your data.
* Configure logins and users.
* Use tools and techniques for monitoring security.
* Ensure that your data meets industry and regulatory compliance standards.
* Take advantage of the extra benefits and intelligence provided by Azure.

This module also covers some of the networking considerations for securing SQL.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you should be able to:  

* Make informed decisions about securing your network.
* Manage and deliver access management and authorization.  
* Protect, encrypt, and mask data.
* Manage and monitor security for your Azure SQL Database instance and Azure SQL managed instance.

## Prerequisites  

* Experience working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server.
* Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources.

For the exercises, a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, to complete the exercises, you need to set up a few things on your local machine:  

* Use a Windows machine or virtual machine (VM).
* Download and install [the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true). SSMS is available only on Windows.
* Download and install [the latest version of Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?azure-portal=true).
* Download the [mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals-master.zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access the lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to *C:\Users\\[YourUsername]* so that you can access it easily in the exercises.

If you can't complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and view demos of the exercises.
