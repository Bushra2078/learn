SQL Server and Azure SQL services have been known for the importance they put on security, specifically as being enterprise-class. In this unit, you'll learn about the various security capabilities related to network security and identity and access. In the units that follow, you'll get hands on with some of these capabilities.

## Network security

The first layer of security involves the network. The networking capabilities and tasks differ between Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, so they'll be discussed separately.

### Azure SQL Database

When you're securing your network for Azure SQL Database, you have four main choices:

- Allow access to Azure services
- Use firewall rules
- Use virtual network rules
- Use Azure Private Link

In addition to these main choices, you have the opportunity to block all public access (only with Private Link) and the option to force a minimum Transport Layer Security (TLS) version.

#### Allow access to Azure services

During the deployment of Azure SQL Database, you have the option to set **Allow Azure services and resources access to this server** to **Yes**. If you choose this option, you're allowing any resource from any region or subscription the possibility to access your resource. This option makes it easy to get up and running and get Azure SQL Database connected to other services, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), Azure App Services, or even Azure Cloud Shell, because you're allowing anything that comes through Azure to have the potential to connect.

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-allow-access.png" alt-text="Diagram of allow access to Azure services." border="false":::

Allowing access to Azure services does not, however, allow anything outside of Azure (for example, your on-premises environment) to have access.

If you can switch **Allow Azure services and resources access to this server** to **No**, doing so is the most secure configuration of the public endpoint. It blocks all connections and networks, apart from ones you've explicitly added with the various options that follow in the next sections.

#### Firewall rules

Your next option is to apply firewall rules. Your results might be similar to those of **Allow Azure services and resources access to this server** except that, for each service to connect (in the following image, a VM), you'll need to add a unique firewall rule to allow the VM to connect. Firewall rules also enable your on-premises environment, because you can add the rules for machines and applications in your on-premises environment.

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-firewall-rules.png" alt-text="Diagram of firewall rules." border="false":::

To get connectivity in Azure, you can also allow access to Azure services and then add firewall rules for on-premises connectivity only. As previously mentioned, **Allow Azure services and resources access to this server** is not as secure, because it allows all Azure traffic. So we recommend that you use firewall rules exclusively.

Let's look at the preceding example with firewall rules configured. From a tool that supports Transact-SQL (T-SQL), you could run the following query from your Azure VM in the virtual network SQLDBVNET-EUS:

```sql
SELECT client_net_address FROM sys.dm_exec_connections WHERE session_id=@@SPID;
```  

The result would be `174.17.218.16`. This IP address is the public IP address of the Azure VM. Even though we're using firewall rules, all the connections being made are public.

#### Virtual network rules

If you want to use only firewall rules, setting this up can be complicated. It means that you'll have to specify a range of IP addresses for all your connections, which can sometimes have dynamic IP addresses. A much easier alternative is to use virtual network rules to establish and manage access from specific networks that contain VMs or other services that need to access the data.

If you configure access from a virtual network with a virtual network rule, any resources in that virtual network can access the Azure SQL Database logical server. This can simplify the challenge of configuring access to all static and dynamic IP addresses that need to access the data. By using virtual network rules, you can specify one or more virtual networks, encompassing all the resources within them. You can also start to apply virtual network technologies to connect networks across regions in both Azure and on-premises.  

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-vnet-rules.png" alt-text="Diagram of virtual network rules." border="false":::

In this example, as in the previous section, you could run the same query from your Azure VM in the virtual network SQLDBVNET-EUS:

```sql
SELECT client_net_address FROM sys.dm_exec_connections WHERE session_id=@@SPID;
```  

The result would now be `10.0.0.2`, the private IP address of the Azure VM. This result gets you one step closer to making private connections to your Azure SQL Database logical server, because resources are now connecting through the virtual network.

Another common strategy for analyzing your connection is to examine the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy. In the same Azure VM, in a command prompt, you could run the following command:

```cmd
nslookup aw-server.database.windows.net  
```

By using this command, you can get details that are related to the DNS infrastructure. Your results would be something similar to the following:  

```cmd
Server: Unknown
Address: 168.63.129.16

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   cr2.eastus1-a.control.database.windows.net
Address:    174.17.218.16
Aliases:    aw-server.database.windows.net
            dataslice2.eastus.database.windows.net
```

Under the non-authoritative answer are some important things to look at:  

- **Name**: The endpoint starting with `cr2` is part of the public DNS hierarchy. Without getting too much into the hierarchy, let's say that *cr2* is *control ring 2* and that there are multiple data "slices" below it.  
- **Address**: The IP address returned here should match the public IP address of your Azure VM. Although a tool such as the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) final hop might be through your VM's private IP address, the public IP address of your VM is still being used to connect in some capacity.  
- **Aliases**: Aliases are various points within the DNS hierarchy, in this case the specific data "slice" and endpoint you connect to.  

**Fun fact**: In the preceding image, **Address: 168.63.129.16** is a virtual public IP address that's used to facilitate a communication channel to Azure platform resources. It applies to all regions and all national clouds, and it won't change.

Although the connection through T-SQL comes through the private IP address of the Azure VM, you're still ultimately connecting through a public endpoint.

### Private Link for an Azure SQL Database instance

You've seen how to configure the most secure network by using your database in Azure SQL Database with the public endpoint, which is similar to the way that your Azure SQL managed instance is deployed. This method of securing a database in SQL Database has been used for years. However, in 2019, Azure began moving toward a concept of a private link, which is more like the way that Azure SQL Managed Instance is deployed. With Private Link, you can connect to your database in SQL Database and several other platform as a service offerings by using a private endpoint. This means that it has a private IP address within a specific virtual network.  

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-private-endpoint.png" alt-text="Diagram of a private endpoint connection." border="false":::

In the preceding example, you'll notice that the general networking infrastructure did not change and you can still apply the virtual network connectivity strategies from the virtual network rules. However, you won't have to create virtual network rules. Resources that need to connect to the database server must have access to the virtual network where the endpoint resides. In the example, the endpoint is SQLDBVNet-EUS. Only connections that go through the private endpoint have access, and all other connections (for example, from the internet) are denied.

As you continue with this example, on the Azure VM in virtual network SQLDBVNet-EUS, you could once again run the following T-SQL command:

```sql
SELECT client_net_address FROM sys.dm_exec_connections WHERE session_id=@@SPID;
```

The result would now be `10.0.0.2`, which is the private IP address of the Azure VM in this example. By adding access from your virtual network, connections to Azure SQL Database from your VM will appear to come through the private IP address of your VM. This is the same result you saw with virtual network rules.  

However, you might want to use the command prompt to look at the DNS hierarchy by using the following command:

```cmd
nslookup aw-server.database.windows.net  
```

If you use the preceding command, your results will be slightly different with the private endpoint configured:  

```cmd
Server: Unknown
Address: 168.63.129.16

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   aw-server.privatelink.database.windows.net
Address:    10.0.0.5
Aliases:    aw-server.database.windows.net
```

Under the non-authoritative answer are some important things to look at:  

- **Name**: Note that you're no longer pointing to the public DNS hierarchy, only to the Private Link DNS. This means that less information is revealed about your database server.  
- **Addresses**: For virtual network rules, the address that's returned is the public IP address of your VM, but it should now be one or more *private* IP addresses within the Private Link hierarchy (one is the private endpoint of your Azure SQL Database).
- **Aliases**: As in the Name field, nothing is related to the DNS hierarchy, except that you can still connect to the server name (for example, `aw-server.database.windows.net`).  

One thing you might be wondering, if you're connecting to the private endpoint, is *why are you still using the same server name?* In the back end, when you use only the Private Link method of connecting (that is, no firewall or virtual network rules), the information is processed as follows:  

- `aw-server.database.windows.net`  
  - Resolved by service to `aw-server.privatelink.database.net`  
    - Resolved by service to `10.0.0.5` (the IP address of your private endpoint)  

Additionally, the service will block you from directly connecting by using anything other than `aw-server.database.windows.net`.  

### An Azure SQL managed instance

Although deploying an Azure SQL managed instance differs from deploying a database in SQL Database, it's easy to translate networking functionality at a high level from one to the other. For an Azure SQL managed instance, either before or during deployment, you must create a specific subnet, or logical grouping within a virtual network, with several requirements to host the managed instances. After they're deployed, they're already configured similar to a private endpoint in a database in SQL Database. By using standard networking practices, you must enable access to the virtual network where the managed instance lives. By default, you have a private endpoint and relatively private DNS hierarchy.  

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-sql-managed-instance-network.png" alt-text="Diagram of SQL Managed Instance network." border="false":::

There are references in the summary about how exactly your subnet must be deployed and configured. If you go through the Azure portal flow for deployment, the virtual network and subnet can be deployed for you.

## Identity and access

After you've worked out the networking access, the next layer to consider is identity and access.

### Role-based access control

All Azure types of operations for Azure SQL are controlled through role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC is currently decoupled from SQL Security, but you can think of it as security rights outside of your database in SQL Database or SQL managed instance, with a scope that includes subscription, resource group, and resource. The rights apply to operations in the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, and Azure PowerShell. RBAC allows for separation of duties between deployment, management, and usage.

Built-in roles are available to reduce the need for higher-level RBAC roles such as Owner or Contributor. Effectively, you can use these roles to have certain individuals deploy Azure SQL resources (or manage security policies) but grant other users actual access to use or manage the instance or database.  For example, a SQL Server contributor could deploy a server but assign an Azure SQL Database instance user to be the admin of the server and databases. The built-in roles include:  

- **SQL DB Contributor**: Can create and manage databases but can't access the database (for example, can't connect and read data)
- **SQL Managed Instance Contributor**: Can create and manage managed instances but can't access them
- **SQL Security Manager**:  Can manage security policies for databases and instances (such as auditing) but can't access them
- **SQL Server Contributor**: Can manage servers and databases but can't access them.

### Authentication

For both Azure SQL Database instances and Azure SQL managed instances, SQL authentication is used for deployment. This authentication role is referred to as the *server admin*. For databases in Azure SQL Database, the server admin is a server-level principal for the Azure SQL Database logical server but, for Azure SQL managed instances, the role is a member of the sysadmin server role. In addition, *Mixed Mode* authentication is forced for both deployment options.

If you're migrating a workload that needs Windows Authentication or your organization uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can use Azure AD. For both Azure SQL managed instances and Azure SQL Database instances, you can assign an Azure AD server admin by using the portal or command-line tools.

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-azure-ad-admin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting the Azure AD administrator." border="false":::  

Depending on how your organization has configured the Azure AD instance, you can connect to it by using any of the following three methods (for example, in SSMS):

* **Azure Active Directory - Integrated**: A non-interactive method that you can use if you're signed in to Windows with your Azure AD credentials from a federated domain.  
* **Azure Active Directory - Password**: A non-interactive method that allows you to connect with an Azure AD principal name by using the Azure AD-managed domain. From the documentation: 

   *This can apply to native or federated Azure AD users. A native user is one explicitly created in Azure AD and being authenticated using user name and password, while a federated user is a Windows user whose domain is federated with Azure AD. The latter method (using user & password) can be used when a user wants to use their windows credential, but their local machine is not joined with the domain (for example, using a remote access). In this case, a Windows user can indicate their domain account and password and can authenticate to SQL Database/Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL DW) by using federated credentials.*  
* **Azure Active Directory - Universal with Multi-Factor Authentication**: An interactive method that safeguards access to data while meeting an organization's demand for a single sign-in process with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication.

For an Azure SQL managed instance, the method is similar to that for SQL Server: you can have SQL or Azure AD sign-ins, database users, and contained database users. 

For Azure SQL Database instances, there are a few nuances. You can have SQL log-ins, database users, and even contained database users for Azure AD (recommended). Although the server admin for Azure SQL Database essentially has sysadmin rights, you can create more limited admins by using database level roles in the master of the Azure SQL Database logical server. Two roles are available:

* **loginmanager**: A database-level role that allows members to create logins for the database server.
* **dbmanager**: A database-level role that allows members to create and delete databases for the database server.

Finally, when you set up and configure authentication and authorization, you have four guidelines to follow:  

- Deploy with a server admin
- Create other admins as necessary
- Admins can create users
- Grant access just like you would in SQL Server

## Other capabilities

After you get hands on with some of the network and authentication capabilities, later in the module you'll examine other capabilities (and their related tasks) for data protection, monitoring, logging, and auditing.
