# Example scenario

Suppose you're responsible for deploying and configuring the Azure infrastructure at a toy company. You've created a number of Bicep templates, which you've stored on your own computer. But now you're building up such a large collection of templates, you're finding it hard to keep track of things. You've experimented with changes to some of your templates and have got multiple copies of files. You even accidentally broke a working template by making a change to it before you went on vacation, and now you can't remember what you changed or how to fix it. You feel like there must be a better way to manage your Bicep code.
