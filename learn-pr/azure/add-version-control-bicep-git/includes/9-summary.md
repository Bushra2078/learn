Thanks to your efforts, your toy company has a large set of Bicep files to deploy all aspects of their Azure infrastructure. Managing these files has been a challenge, though, and you needed a way to keep track of the changes you've made.

In this module, you learned how the Git version control system can be used with Bicep code to provide a repository for your deployment templates. You learned about the benefits of using Git with Bicep code, and how Git can scale from a single person to an entire organization. You then used Visual Studio Code to initialize a Git repository, added and updated some files, viewed their history, and created a branch, which you then merged.

Now, whenever you make changes to your Bicep templates, you can be sure that your updates are tracked and that you can see older versions of your files. You can even use branches to work on experimental changes without breaking the current known-good files.

Git is a powerful tool for working with deployment templates and scripts. There's a lot more to know about Git's capabilities.

- The learning path [Introduction to version control with Git](/learn/paths/intro-to-vc-git/) is a good next step to provide a deeper overview.
- The module [Use Git version-control tools in Visual Studio Code](/learn/modules/use-git-from-vs-code/) provides more information on Git integration into Visual Studio Code.
