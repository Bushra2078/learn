## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Analyze your Azure infrastructure with Azure Monitor logs*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    An operations team for an enterprise would like to consolidate their log data in a single service to improve visibility across services and simplify their logging strategy. They've begun implementing Azure Monitor logs and would like to get a full understanding of how it works, and what the capabilities are to query and evaluate the log data being fed into the service.

## Notes

We likely won't use sandbox for this module, as searchable data won't be prepopulated. We do have a demo portal that is publicly available though, and can probably use that for the hands on portion.
