The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```csharp-interactive
string pangram = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";

string[] message = pangram.Split(" ");
string[] newMessage = new string[message.Length];

for (int i = 0; i < message.Length; i++)
{
    char[] letters = message[i].ToCharArray();
    Array.Reverse(letters);
    newMessage[i] = new string(letters);
}

string result = String.Join(" ", newMessage);
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because you could have taken different approaches to various steps in this process.  As long as your output matches the following, you succeeded!

```output
ehT kciuq nworb xof spmuj revo eht yzal god
```

If you were successful, congratulations!  Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
