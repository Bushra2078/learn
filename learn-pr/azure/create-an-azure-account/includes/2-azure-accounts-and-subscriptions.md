Whether you're an individual, a small business, an enterprise, or a student, you need a subscription to use Azure services. The typical approach is to start with a 12-month free subscription so that you can evaluate Azure services.

With a free Azure account and subscription, you can build, test, and deploy enterprise applications, create custom web and mobile experiences, and gain insights from your data through machine learning and powerful analytics. When the trial period expires, you can convert from the free subscription to Pay-As-You-Go, or continue to use over [25 "always free" services](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) such as App Service for hosting websites and AI services to translate text and identify faces.

## What is an Azure account?

An _Azure account_ is an identity in either Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), or a directory that is trusted by Azure AD, such as a work or school organization. It holds information such as:

- Name, email, and contact preferences
- Billing information such as a credit card

You use an Azure account to sign in to the Azure website and administer or deploy services. Every Azure account is associated with one or more  _subscriptions_.

## What is an Azure subscription?

An _Azure subscription_ is a logical container used to provision resources in Microsoft Azure. It holds the details of all your resources like virtual machines, databases, and so on. Every Azure subscription is associated with Azure AD. Users and services that access the resources of the subscription first need to authenticate with Azure AD.

### Subscription types

Azure offers free and paid subscription options to suit different needs and requirements. The most commonly used subscriptions are:

- Free
- Pay-As-You-Go
- Enterprise Agreement
- Student

#### Azure free subscription

An Azure free subscription includes a **$200 credit** to spend on any service for the first 30 days, free access to the most popular Azure products for 12 months, and access to more than 25 products that are always free. This approach is an excellent way for new users to get started. To set up a free subscription, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft account.

> Credit card information is used for identity verification only. You wonâ€™t be charged for any services until you upgrade.

#### Azure Pay-As-You-Go subscription

A Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscription charges you monthly for the services you used in that billing period. This subscription type is appropriate for a wide range of users, from individuals to small businesses, and many large organizations as well.

An Azure for Students subscription includes **$100 in Azure credits** to be used within the first 12 months plus select free services without requiring a credit card at sign-up. You must verify your student status through your organizational email address.
