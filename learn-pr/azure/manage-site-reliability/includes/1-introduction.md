DevOps practices encourage software developers to take a larger role in operations and application monitoring. Recent advances in tooling make it easier for developers to own their projects from creation all the way to production.

In this module, you learn about managing site reliability, which includes telemetry analysis, alerting on-site reliability symptoms, and analyzing and tuning your alerts.

- Describe how Application Insights analyzes the performance of your web application and can warn you about potential problems.
- List the processes that you can implement to monitor site reliability.
- Build a "just culture" that balances safety and accountability.
