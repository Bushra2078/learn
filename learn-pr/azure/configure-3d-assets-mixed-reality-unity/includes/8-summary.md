Meaningful experiences in the HoloLens 2 begin with careful planning and design, even before any code or configuration is done.  Design considerations include overall Scene layout, asset size and scale, proximity to avoid moving component collisions, and a consideration of how your end user will place the Scene in runtime in the HoloLens 2.

Once the experience building begins and after contextual information (for example, terrain) has been added, you need to load Assets with which to interact.  To accelerate the development process, particularly when adding multiple Assets into your Scene, consider using Unity Prefabs. In this module, you saw how you can use Prefabs to add multiple wind turbine Assets to your scene quickly and they share most of the same properties.

Developing interactions with your Scene in the HoloLens 2 is made much easier by using MRTK. By using MRTK interactions, you gain advanced HoloLens interactivity without having to write the code to support it.  

As a final Unit in this module, you deployed your solution to the HoloLens 2 and experienced the beginnings of your Digital Twin of a wind farm.
