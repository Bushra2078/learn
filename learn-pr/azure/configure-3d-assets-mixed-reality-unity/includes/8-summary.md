Meaningful experiences in for mixed reality begin with careful planning and design, even before any code or configuration is done.  Design considerations include overall Scene layout, asset size and scale, and proximity to avoid moving component collisions.

Once the experience building begins and after contextual information (for example, terrain) has been added, you need to load Assets with which to interact.  To accelerate the development process, particularly when adding multiple Assets into your Scene, consider using Unity Prefabs. In this module, you saw how you can use Prefabs to add multiple wind turbine Assets to your scene quickly and learned how they share most of the same properties.

Developing interactions with your Scene for mixed reality is made much easier by using MRTK. By using MRTK interactions, you gain advanced interactivity without having to write the code to support it.  

In the final Unit in this module, you were able to experience the beginnings of your Digital Twin wind farm in Mixed Reality.
