A well-designed user experience in Unity for the HoloLens requires careful design and creation of a Unity Scene.  A Scene is like a blank canvas, which you'll develop into an experience for your end user. Provide context for your user as they navigate the Scene by adding supportive information like satellite imagery or lower fidelity supportive information (for example, surrounding warehouse infrastructure).  Once context has been established for the Scene, you need to create and add the 3D assets or models for your Digital Twin.  These will be the showcase of your experience.

## Example scenario  

You'll continue to build out the example windfarm scenario from previous modules, except this time you're looking to add in reusable wind turbine objects to the project's terrain.

## What will we be doing?

For your wind farm use case, you'll add wind turbine Assets to your Scene that have been created for you.  Assets that have been created in advance, complete with configuration parameters are called Prefabs.  If you completed the previous module, **Build a 3D Scene for Mixed Reality in Unity**, you're already familiar with Prefabs and used static and dynamic terrain Prefabs.  

In this module, you'll explore Prefabs in more detail and use them to build out your Scene to prepare your wind farm for operations.  You'll add 3D Prefabs that can be connected to cloud services such as Azure Digital Twin to operationalize your Digital Twins and bring them to life.

## What is the main goal?

Building a Scene is an important initial step in developing your Mixed Reality experience. By the end of this module, you can work with Unity Prefabs and Scriptable Objects, and Mixed Reality Toolkit interactions.
