Below this we see the parameter for age is 0.14, meaning that for additional each year of age, the predicted temperature would rise 0.14 degrees celcius. For `male`, we can see a parameter of 0.32, meaning that the model estimates all dogs (i.e. where `male == 1`) to have temperatures 0.32 degrees celcius higher than female dogs (i.e. where `male == 0`).\n",

For example, here both `age` and `male` are less than 0.05, so we should feel confident using this model in the real world.\n",
