In this module, you learnt about Azure Load Balancers and how they can be used to minimise the impact of failures and increase resilience and stability. We used this knowledge to create a resilient healthcare portal capable of adapting to meet the application requirements of session affinity. You've learned how to group virtual machines behind a load balancer to increase availability. By implementing the load balancer in the healthcare portal you understood the differences bewteen an internal and external load balancer. You also discovered how the load balancer can be configured to provide availability across data centres with the use of availability zones.
