  questions:
  - content: 'A Cloud-Native architecture has a focus on:'
    choices:
    - content: "A single codebase where all the different functionalities reside"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A single codebase would indicate a monolithic approach, whereas different functionality would be separated with a cloud-native approach."
    - content: "Architectural modularity, using pre-built cloud services and container technologies where suited."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Cloud-Native architecture focuses on having individual, separated components that form different services. CNAs are built to leverage cloud-based services to handle aspects like security where appropriate."
    - content: "Hybrid-cloud approach"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a hybrid-cloud approach may be part of some cloud-native architectures, not all cloud-native architectures will use a hybrid cloud approach."
    - content: "Smart fridges"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Smart fridges are our scenario, not all Cloud Native Apps focus on smart fridges."
  - content: 'Containers provide a reliable environment that works the same on different machines. Why is this?'
    choices:
    - content: "Containers contain an image of a virtual machine OS - once loaded, the virtual machine always runs the same."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Containers do not contain a virtual machine OS - they are lightweight and encapsulate dependencies, but not an operating system."
    - content: "Containers are managed by container orchestrators that replace hardware as needed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While containers are managed by container orchestrators, the container orchestrators do not replace hardware as needed."
    - content: "Containers leverage a hybrid-development approach where you set new parameters every time you deploy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Containers use exact same container image when deployed - you do not have to set new parameters every time you deploy."
    - content: "Containers are self-contained and encapsulate their own code, configuration, and dependencies, including references to the OS they'll run on."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. As containers are self-contained, and have the exact same container image when they are deployed, they reliably function the same on different machines."
  - content: 'How can Cloud Native Apps help to create business value?'
    choices:
    - content: "A Cloud-Native approach allows rapid incorporation of user feedback."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While rapid incorporation of user feedback can be provided by a Cloud-Native approach, there are other ways Cloud Native Apps help to create business value."
    - content: "Cloud services have built in tools and integrations for automation, such as constant integration (CI) and constant deployment (CD) pipelines. Therefore, Cloud Native Apps are more likely to have robust DevOps procedures, which can decrease costs and increase reliability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While automation is a benefit of cloud native processes, there are other ways Cloud Native Apps help to create business value"
    - content: "A Cloud Native architecture allows individual services to be updated and deployed without downtime for other services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While there is significant business value from being able to update a service with no downtime for other services, there are other ways Cloud Native Apps help to create business value"
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Rapid incorporation of user feedback increases business agility for constant improvement, automation can decrease costs and increase reliability, and individual services being able to update a service with no downtime for other services all provide real business value."
