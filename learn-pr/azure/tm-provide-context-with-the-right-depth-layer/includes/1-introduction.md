Threat modeling provides engineers with the ability to graphically describe their system to others. It creates a common ground and enables more focused security conversations.

However, threat models can either get **too complex** or **too high level** depending on the system you're building and the required context.

Data-flow diagram depth layers help you understand how much context to include and when to use them. Talk to your colleagues and security team members to select which depth layer to use and use this module as reference.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- Data-flow diagram depth layers
- When to use each layer
