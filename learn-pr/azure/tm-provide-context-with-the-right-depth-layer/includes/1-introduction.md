## What It's About

Threat modeling provides engineers with the ability to graphically describe their system to others. It creates a common ground and enables more focused security conversations.

## Why Are Depth Layers Important?

Threat models can either get too complex or too high level depending on the system you're building and the required context.

Data-flow diagram depth layers help you understand how much context to include and when to use them.

> [!TIP]
> Talk to your colleagues and security team to select the right depth layer. Use can also use this module as reference.
