The threat modeling framework provides you with a list of threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk, but it doesn't prioritize them for you. Also, there are no layered security control recommendations based on their type and function.

In this module, you learned about prioritizing your issues and applying the right layer of security controls based on type and function.

You learned about:

- Prioritizing your issues
- Categorizing security controls
- Understanding each security control function

> In addition to the four layers, you can also create diagrams based on user roles to help identify authentication and authorization weaknesses. According to sources like [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), those mishaps are among the top security issues across organizations today, so applying threat modeling per applicable role can strengthen your overall system security and help protect your customers.
