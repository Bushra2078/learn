Threat modeling provides engineers with the ability to graphically describe their system to others. It creates a common ground and enables more focused security conversations.

However, threat models can either get **too complex** or **too high level** depending on the system you're building and the required context.

In this module, you learned about prioritizing your issues and applying the right layer of security controls based on type and function.

You learned about:

- Data-flow diagram depth layers
- When to use each layer

> [!NOTE]
>**Did You Know?**
> In addition to the four layers, you can also create diagrams based on user roles to help identify authentication and authorization weaknesses. According to sources like [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), those mishaps are among the top security issues across organizations today, so applying threat modeling per applicable role can strengthen your overall system security and help protect your customers.
