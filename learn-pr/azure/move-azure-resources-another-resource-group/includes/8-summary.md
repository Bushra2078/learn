A number of important production resources were deleted by accident because they were in the same resource group. You were asked to separate development resources from production resources by moving them into their own development resource group.

Using the Azure portal, you identified all resources in the production resource group. Then you checked the limitations of each resource and whether it could be moved to a new resource group. To confirm the correct resources would move successfully, you ran a test validation. You created a new resource group to hold the development resources using the Azure portal. Then you moved resources from the production resource group to the new resource group and confirmed that the resources were in the new group.

By using the Azure portal, you easily moved resources to the correct place. Now your production resources are separate from your development resources.
