  title: "Manage devices in IoT Central"
  questions:
  - content: "What does a device template contain?"
    choices:
    - content: "Interface definitions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes. The device template includes a device capability model and its associated interface definitions."
    - content: "Device firmware"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. An interface might define a property to store a firmware version number, but the template doesn't include the device firmware."
    - content: "Device credentials"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. A real device in IoT Central stores credentials."
  - content: "What types of device can you create in an IoT Central application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only real devices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can add both real and simulated devices from a device template in IoT Central."
    - content: "Real and simulated devices"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can add both real and simulated devices from a device template in IoT Central."
    - content: "Only simulated devices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can add both real and simulated devices from a device template in IoT Central."
  - content: "What happens when you block a device?"
    choices:
    - content: "The device can't send data to your IoT Central application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Blocking a device stops it sending data to IoT Central. This is useful if you suspect the device is sending incorrect data because of an error."
    - content: "The operator can't make changes to the device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The operator can still make changes to a device while it's blocked."
    - content: "You can't update the device's cloud properties."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cloud properties aren't stored on the device, so they can still be updated."
