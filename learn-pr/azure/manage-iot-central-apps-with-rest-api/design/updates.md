1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

    You wanted to integrate common device management functions into your existing fleet management application. To enable this scenario, you needed to access your IoT Central application programmatically.

    Without integration, an operator would need to use both the existing fleet management application and the IoT Central dashboards to manage the vehicle fleet.

    By using the IoT Central REST API, you were able to integrate device management, device monitoring and control, and query operations into the existing fleet management application, simplifying the operator's job.
