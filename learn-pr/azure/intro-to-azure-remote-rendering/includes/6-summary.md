Our goal was to help you to determine whether Azure Remote Rendering can help you:

- Render complex models.
- Achieve the desired visual fidelity.
- Live stream the complex models to your local device.

To help with your decision, you used the following criteria:

- Complexity of 3D models
- Required visual fidelity of images

You applied these criteria to a fictional automotive manufacturer. The manufacturer had complex 3D models that they needed to be able to view in HoloLens.

You've learned that the computing resource necessary in your on-premises datacenter is sometimes insufficient to render 3D models to the desired detail quickly enough. This means that you must choose between scaling down the detail, or increasing the available compute resources. Our criteria helped you decide that by using Azure Remote Rendering, you can render complex 3D models to any desired detail level.

You should now be able to determine whether Azure Remote Rendering can help you render and live-stream complex models to the desired visual fidelity within your own organization.
