You're responsible for networking at Adatum Corporation, a company that provides high-resolution satellite imagery to emergency-services organizations. Adatum's imagery offers immediate detailed visibility on unfolding natural disasters including fires, floods, tsunamis, and other catastrophic events. The servers that host this imagery are currently running as infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machines (VMs) in a North American Azure datacenter.

To respond effectively as a disaster unfolds, Adatum needs to ensure that its emergency-services clients are able to reliably access the large amounts of data related to this content in a timely manner. In the last year alone, fire-management crews in Australia were able to contain large fires in remote areas through the information Adatum's imagery services provided to them. As Adatum's reputation as a provider of this imagery has grown, more government and private organizations are in the process of signing contracts to be able to engage the company's services. Part of your responsibility is to ensure that Adatum's services can scale to meet this growing demand without having to deploy an increasing number of IaaS VM web server hosts. Because Adatum's services are needed during natural disasters, it's important that these services don't become unavailable if traffic suddenly spikes as a calamity unfolds.
