Azure CDN is a distributed network of servers that's used to cache and store content that can be accessed by computers requesting it around the world. Geographic distance between a website user and the server hosting the site can be a major contributor to latency. Azure CDN servers are in locations that are close to end users to minimize latency. Rather than retrieve a large file from a single location that might be on another continent or in another hemisphere, Azure CDN allows a client requesting that content to retrieve it from the location to which they have the lowest latency and highest bandwidth connection. The server locations that host content repositories are referred to as *point-of-presence (POP)* locations. The use of a CDN is transparent to users of your site.

Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content that canâ€™t be cached by using various network optimizations using CDN POPs; for example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

The benefits of using Azure CDN to deliver web site assets include:

- Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round trips are required to load content.
- Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.
- Distribution of user requests and serving content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server.

Azure CDN offers the following features:

- **Dynamic site acceleration**: Speed up the delivery of dynamic files.
- **HTTPS custom domain support**: Enable encrypted connections to custom domains, such as `https://www.adatum.com`.
- **Azure diagnostics logs**: View core analytic information and send the data to an Azure Storage account, Azure Event Hubs, or a Log Analytics Workspace.
- **File compression**: Increase performance by reducing the number of bytes in transit.
- **Geo-filtering**: Create rules on your CDN endpoint that use specific paths to allow or block content in select countries/regions.

The benefits of using Azure CDN include:

- Better performance and a smoother user experience with large or streamed files.
- Improved results with applications that require multiple round trips to display content.
- Greater scaling, especially with rapidly spiking loads, such as global launch events.
- Reduced traffic to the origin server.
