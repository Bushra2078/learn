You learned about how Azure CDN caching behavior functions, how you can configure geo-filtering for files to restrict POP access to specific locales, and how Azure CDN can automatically compress files to reduce the size of content that is transmitted to client hosts. You learned about the types of scenarios in which Azure CDN is an appropriate solution for your organization and how Azure CDN is likely able to meet Adatum's needs.
