  questions:
    - content: Applications based on which of the following Azure services are most likely to benefit from deploying and configuring Azure Content Delivery Network?
      choices:
        - content: Azure Cosmos DB
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB can already be globally distributed and won't benefit from the deployment of Azure Content Delivery Network.
        - content: Azure DNS
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Azure DNS is already globally distributed and won't benefit from the deployment of Azure Content Delivery Network.
        - content: Azure web apps
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Azure web apps are likely to benefit from deploying and configuring Azure Content Delivery Network because the web app content can be provided closer to requesting clients.  
    - content: Which of the following Azure Content Delivery Network features would Adatum use to ensure that content hosted in an Australian POP isn't accessed by client hosts in Europe?
      choices: 
        - content: Cache TTL
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Cache TTL determines how long content remains at the Azure Content Delivery Network before that content is refreshed.
        - content: Geo-filtering
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. You can use geo-filtering to limit the access that client hosts in specific geographies have to Azure Content Delivery Network content.
        - content: Session persistence
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Compression allows some Azure Content Delivery Network content to be transmitted to client hosts in a smaller size, which is then decompressed when consumed on the client host.
    - content: Which of the following applications architecture would most be enhanced with Azure Content Delivery Network if the content hosted in that application was being accessed by client hosts around the world?
      choices:
        - content: A web application that streams video of live sports events.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Live data is always changing, so storing cached copies for several days doesn't improve the application experience. Only recordings of events made after such events conclude could benefit from Azure Content Delivery Network.
        - content: A web application that performs live translation of spoken audio.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A web application that performs live translation of spoken audio is unlikely to benefit substantially from having website content cached around the world.
        - content: A web application that displays prerecorded videos.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Receiving prerecorded videos in locations close to where the videos are accessed improves performance for client hosts accessing that content.
