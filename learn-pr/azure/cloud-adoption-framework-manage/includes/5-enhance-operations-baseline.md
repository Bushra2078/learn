So far in this module, we have talked about the three cloud management disciplines, which we call management baseline. This unit will look beyond the default management baseline. There are most likely workloads in your environment that require more management services than described in the management baseline. Enhanced management baseline is often a low operations investment, compared to workload or platform specialization.

If most of your workloads require more than your default management baseline, reviewing the management baseline is a good idea. When new services are implemented or new features of Azure is released, a management baseline review is a good idea. For example, if the company implements an ITSM solution, a connection to automate create incident adds to the enhanced operations baseline.

Workload specialization is for workloads the most mission-critical workloads. This is approximately 20% of the workloads.

Platform specialization is for the platform or platforms that run the most high-criticality workloads. The specialized platform investment is often divided over many workloads.

The following table shows some of the most common enhancements to a management baseline.
