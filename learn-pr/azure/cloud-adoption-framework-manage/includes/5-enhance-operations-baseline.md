So far in this module, we've talked about the three cloud-management disciplines, which we call a management baseline. This unit will look beyond the default management baseline. 

There are most likely workloads in your environment that require more management services than those described in the management baseline. An *enhanced* management baseline is often a low-operations investment, compared to workload or platform specialization.

If most of your workloads require more than your default management baseline, it's a good idea to review the management baseline. It's also a good idea to review your management baseline when new services are implemented or new Azure features are released. For example, if your company implements an IT service management (ITSM) solution, a connection to automate incident creation adds to the enhanced operations baseline.

*Workload specialization* is for the most mission-critical workloads. This is about 20 percent of the workloads.

*Platform specialization* is for the platform or platforms that run the most high-criticality workloads. The specialized platform investment is often divided over many workloads.

The following table shows some of the most common enhancements to a management baseline:
