As a business moves to a cloud-based model, the importance of proper management and operations can't be overstated. In Azure, it's possible to visualize what management solutions cost per workload. In other words, the business can balance management cost against how critical the workload is to the business.

A management baseline is the minimum set of tools applied to all resources in the environment. This module will walk through the three disciplines in a cloud management baseline, including

- **Inventory and visibility.** Inventorying assets and creating visibility into the run state of each resource of a workload
- Operational compliance. Management of configuration, sizing, cost, and performance of assets
- **Protect and recover.** Data protection and quick recovery to minimizing operational interruptions

The module then covers how to enhance the management baseline. The end of the module reviews the specialization principles and platform specialization. Both workload specialization and platform specialization can support our most critical workloads and platforms. The start of the module looks into business alignment to make sure everyone uses the same terms. The following image shows the components of a management baseline that this module covers.

### Module scenario

Suppose you work as an IT operations architect at Tailwind Traders. The company has been migrating two datacenters to Azure. In this process, they want to modernize IT operations and their IT management solution. They use the guidance in this Learn module to evaluate how a cloud-native solution will support their cloud journey. In the new cloud-native solution there will be a management baseline for the cloud environment. The fundamental management baseline will be for all workloads, and some extra features for specific platforms and workloads. The solution should also enable reporting on management costs for the business stakeholders.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn to:

- Set a baseline for criticality, impact, and commitment for your business
- Understand which Azure management tools to include in a management baseline
- How to partner with workload and platform teams for more prosperous decentralized operations

## Prerequisites

- A foundational understanding of cloud adoption
- Understanding of your organization's operations management requirements
