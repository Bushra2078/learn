This discipline is the cornerstone for maintaining the balance between security, governance, performance, and cost. Effective operational compliance requires consistency in a few critical processes:

- **Resource consistency:** If all resources are organized the same way and tagged the same way, other management tasks become more manageable.
- Environment consistency. If all landing zones are organized the same way, both management and troubleshooting become much more manageable.
- **Resource configuration consistency.** As with resources and landing zones, it's crucial to monitor resource configuration. If a configuration setting is changed, it can trigger an automation job to restore the environment.
- **Resource optimization:** Regular monitoring of resource performance will reveal trends in resource utilization and opportunities to optimize the cost and performance of each resource.
- **Update consistency:** All updates to the environment should be done in a scheduled, controlled, and possibly automated way. Controlled change management will reduce unnecessary outages and troubleshooting.
- **Remediation automation:** Automation for quick remediation of common incidents is a great way to increase customer satisfaction and minimize outages. Known issues should be fixed by their root cause. But often fixing the root cause is a long going process, and automation is a quick fix.

This discipline can be fulfilled per workload, for example, in one of your landing zones.
