Encryption is critical for government customers looking to protect data at all levels of classification. Azure provides extensive options for data encryption through its entire lifecycle (at rest, in transit, and in use), including customer control of encryption keys.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Describe the options for key management in Microsoft Azure.
* Identify various scenarios in which encryption is used to protect data throughout its lifecycle.
* Choose between the various encryption options in Azure.
