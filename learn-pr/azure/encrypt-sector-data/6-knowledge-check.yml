  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What protects connections between customer’s client systems and Microsoft cloud services by generating a unique session key for every session a customer initiate?"
    choices:
    - content: "In-transit encryption for VMs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In-transit encryption for VMs ensures data encryption in transit such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) initiated from a client computer to Windows and Linux VMs to enable TLS protection for data in transit, and Secure Shell (SSH) for encrypted connections to Linux VMs running in Azure."
    - content: "Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. PFS protects connections between customer’s client systems and Microsoft cloud services by generating a unique session key for every session a customer initiate. PFS protects past sessions against potential future key compromises. This combination makes it more difficult to intercept and access data in transit."
    - content: "VPN encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Customers can configure Azure VPN Gateway to use custom IPSec/IKE policy with specific cryptographic algorithms and key strengths instead of relying on the default Azure policies."
    - content: "ExpressRoute encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure ExpressRoute with several data encryption options, including MACsec that enables customers to store MACsec secrets in Azure Key Vault."
  - content: "A symmetric key stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery."
    choices:
    - content: "Database Encryption Key (DEK)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Database Encryption Key (DEK) is a symmetric key stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery. It’s secured via a certificate stored in the primary database of the server."
    - content: "Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) performs real-time encryption and decryption operations on the data and log files."
    - content: "Key Encryption Key (KEK)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Key Encryption Key (KEK) is an asymmetric key that’s optionally provided by the customer. This key is used to encrypt the Data Encryption Key (DEK) using Azure Key Vault and exists only in Azure Key Vault."
    - content: "Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) may be used to encrypt all Azure Windows and Linux IaaS Virtual Machine disks. This encryption includes managed disks."
  - content: "Which two Microsoft guiding principles underpin the other four?"
    choices:
    - content: "Privacy and security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While these guiding principles are very important, they are not essential for ensuring the effectiveness of the rest."
    - content: "Reliability and safety"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While these guiding principles are very important, they are not essential for ensuring the effectiveness of the rest."
    - content: "Fairness and inclusivity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While these guiding principles are very important, they are not essential for ensuring the effectiveness of the rest."
    - content: "Transparency and accountability."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These guiding principles are foundational and are essential for ensuring the effectiveness of the rest."
  - content: "An engineering team wants to develop a new tool that lets users convert their facial expressions into an animated creature. Before launching their tool, they plan on testing it extensively with users from around the world. Which guiding principle(s) is/are most relevant?"
    choices:
    - content: "Fairness and inclusivity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The guiding principle of fairness dictates that AI systems behave the same way for everyone, and the guiding principle of inclusivity dictates that AI tools do not exclude people."
    - content: "Reliability and safety."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The guiding principles of reliability and safety are more relevant in scenarios where AI systems could cause harm."
    - content: "Transparency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The guiding principle of transparency is essential, but not the most relevant here."
    - content: "Privacy and security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The guiding principles of privacy and security should definitely be considerations in this scenario, but testing the tool on a diverse group of users does not address privacy and security concerns."
