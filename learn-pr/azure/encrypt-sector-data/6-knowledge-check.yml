  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What protects connections between customer’s client systems and Microsoft cloud services by generating a unique session key for every session a customer initiate?"
    choices:
    - content: "In-transit encryption for VMs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In-transit encryption for VMs ensures data encryption in transit such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) initiated from a client computer to Windows and Linux VMs to enable TLS protection for data in transit, and Secure Shell (SSH) for encrypted connections to Linux VMs running in Azure."
    - content: "Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. PFS protects connections between customer’s client systems and Microsoft cloud services by generating a unique session key for every session a customer initiate. PFS protects past sessions against potential future key compromises. This combination makes it more difficult to intercept and access data in transit."
    - content: "VPN encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Customers can configure Azure VPN Gateway to use custom IPSec/IKE policy with specific cryptographic algorithms and key strengths instead of relying on the default Azure policies."
    - content: "ExpressRoute encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure ExpressRoute with several data encryption options, including MACsec that enables customers to store MACsec secrets in Azure Key Vault."
  - content: "What is a symmetric key stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery?"
    choices:
    - content: "Database Encryption Key (DEK)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Database Encryption Key (DEK) is a symmetric key stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery. It’s secured via a certificate stored in the primary database of the server."
    - content: "Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) performs real-time encryption and decryption operations on the data and log files."
    - content: "Key Encryption Key (KEK)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Key Encryption Key (KEK) is an asymmetric key that’s optionally provided by the customer. This key is used to encrypt the Data Encryption Key (DEK) using Azure Key Vault and exists only in Azure Key Vault."
    - content: "Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) may be used to encrypt all Azure Windows and Linux IaaS Virtual Machine disks. This encryption includes managed disks."
  - content: "What enables high-scale networks that meet key enterprise requirements such as performance, enhanced confidentiality, and distributed governance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Homomorphic encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Homomorphic encryption is a special type of encryption technology that allows for computations to be performed on encrypted data without requiring access to a key needed to decrypt the data."
    - content: "Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves to allow computations on plaintext data inside a secure enclave on the server side."
    - content: "Multi-party machine learning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Privacy-preserving multi-party machine learning allows multiple organizations to perform collaborative data analytics while guaranteeing the privacy of their individual datasets."
    - content: "Confidential Consortium Blockchain Framework."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Confidential Consortium Blockchain Framework is an open-source system that enables high-scale, confidential blockchain networks that meet key enterprise requirements such as performance, enhanced confidentiality, and distributed governance."
