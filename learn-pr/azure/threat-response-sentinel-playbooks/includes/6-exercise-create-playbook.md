As a security engineer working for Contoso, you recently notice that a significant number of alerts are generated when someone deletes a virtual machine. You want to analyze such occurrences in the future and reduce the alerts generated for false positive occurrences.

## Exercise: Threat response using Microsoft Sentinel playbooks

You decide to implement a Microsoft Sentinel playbook to automate responses to an incident.

In this exercise, you will explore the Microsoft Sentinel playbooks by performing the following tasks:

- Create a playbook to automate an action to respond to incidents.
- Create a playbook from the Microsoft Sentinel repository on GitHub.
