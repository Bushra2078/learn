In this exercise, you will create an Azure Sentinel playbook.

## Exercise 1: Create an Azure Sentinel playbook

<!--Marjan as per the exercise template, we need to have setup section as described below. Can you please provide any content if applicable for the setup section for this exercise?  

Setup
<!-- Provide high level guidance on what needs to exist before tasks can be completed. Likely you'll point the students to a script to run. You might also have additional setup steps to include. -->
Download and run the setup script which will configure your Azure environment for this exercise. The script will <do X>, <do Y>, and <do Z>.
After running the script, create a resource group called ContosoResourceGroup. Details here.
Create a VM. Details here.
<!-- The following steps need to be detailed enough for someone to perform the task themselves - supposing they meet the prereq knowledge -->

### Task 1: Deploy Azure Sentinel

In this task, you will deploy Azure Sentinel.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the Azure portal, search for and select Azure Sentinel and, on the **Azure Sentinel workspaces** blade, select **+ Add.**
3. On the **Add Azure Sentinel to a workspace** blade, select **+ Create a new workspace.**
4. On the  **Create Log Analytics workspace** blade, specify the following settings:

| **Settings** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| Subscription | Provide a name for the Azure subscription you are using in this lab. |
| --- | --- |
| Resource group |Provide **sentinel** as the name for the new resource group. | <!-- Marjan, please check edits to this row-->
| Name | _ **Yourname-** _**Sentinel (**unique name) |
| Region | Provide a region that is closer to you. |

5. Select  **Review + Create**,  and then select  **Create**.

>[!Note]
> Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment should take less than 1 minute.

6. After the workspace is created, in **Add Azure Sentinel to a workspace** blade, select **Add**. <!--Marjan please check if the bolding for the uI terms is correct in this sentence.-->

**Note** : Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment should take less than 1 minute.

### Task 2: Configure Azure Sentinel Connectors

In this task, you will deploy Azure Sentinel connectors to Azure Activity and Azure Security Center.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select Azure Sentinel, and then select the previously created Azure Sentinel workspace <!--MArjan please check if this reference is to Azure Sentinel workspace or should it be "previous created **sentinel** workspace.. the case bolding etc will differ.-->.
2. In the **Azure Sentinel** blade, on the menu bar, in the **Configuration** section, select **Data connectors.**

### Task 3: Work with Azure Sentinel Playbooks 

<!--Marjan, I changed this to task 3 instead of Exercise 2 task 1. I dont thik we have two exercises in the same unit. Can you please double check?-->

Draft lab exercise title: Create an Azure Sentinel playbook

- Task 1. Add a playbook from Logic Apps.
- Task 2. Add an Azure Sentinel connector in Logic Apps.
- Task 3. Add a trigger to Azure Sentinel Connection.
- Task 4. Add an action.
- Task 5. Test the playbook result. <!--Marjan, I am not sure if we re covering all these tasks in this exercise. I am finding it hard to map the exercise and tasks with the design doc or the content here. Can you please double-check?-->

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Sentinel**, and then select the previously created Sentinel workspace.
2. In the **Azure Sentinel** blade, in the menu bar, in the **Configuration** section, select **Playbooks**.

| --- | --- |
| Resource group | Select the resource group of your Azure Sentinel service. |
