The Create an Azure Sentinel playbook exercise in this module is an optional unit. However, if you want to perform this exercise, you need access to an Azure subscription where you can create Azure resources. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) before you begin.

To deploy the prerequisites for the exercise, perform the following tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose to perform the exercise in this module, be aware you might incur costs in your Azure Subscription. To estimate the cost, refer to [Azure Sentinel Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-sentinel/).

## Task 1: Deploy Azure Sentinel

    [![Deploy To Azure.](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoftDocs%2Fmslearn-security-ops-sentinel%2Fmain%2Fmslearn-threat-response-sentinel-playbooks%2Fsentinel-template.json?azure-portal=true)

    You're prompted to sign in to Azure.
    
1. On the **Custom deployment** page, provide the following information:

    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource Group | Select Create new and provide a name for the resource group such as azure-sentinel-rg.|
    | Region | From the drop-down menu, select the region where you want to deploy the Azure Sentinel. |
    | Workspace name | Provide a unique name for the Azure Sentinel workspace such as *yourname*-sentinel. |
    | Location | Accept the default value of [resourceGroup().location]. |

    | *yourname*-sentinel|Log Analytics workspace|Log Analytics workspace used by Azure Sentinel. |
    | simple-vmNetworkInterface|Network interface|Network interface for the VM. |
    | SecurityInsights(*yourname*-sentinel)|Solution|Security insights for Azure Sentinel. |
    | st1*xxxxx*|Storage account|Storage account used by the virtual machine. |
    | simple-vm|Virtual machine|Virtual machine used in the demonstration. |
    | vnet1|Virtual network|Virtual network for the VM. |

> [!Note]
> The resources deployed and configuration steps completed in this exercise are required in the next exercise. If you intended completing the next exercise do not delete the resources from this exercise.

## Task 3: Configure Azure Sentinel Connectors

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Azure Sentinel**, and then select the previously created Azure Sentinel workspace.

    > [!Note]
    > The connector for Azure Activity could take 15 minutes until Azure Sentinel displays a date. You can continue performing the rest of the steps in this unit and subsequent units in this module.

## Task 4: Create an analytics rule

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Sentinel**, and then select the previously created Azure Sentinel workspace.

1. On the **General** page, provide the inputs in the following table, and then select  **Next: Set rule logic >**.

    | --- | --- |
    | Name | Provide a descriptive name such as **Delete Virtual Machines** to explain what type of suspicious activity the alert detects. |
    | Description | Enter a detailed description that will help other security analysts understand what the rule does. |
    | Tactics | From the **Tactics** drop-down menu, choose **Initial Access** category to classify the rule following the MITRE tactics. |
    | Severity | Select the **Severity** drop-down menu to categorize the level of importance of the alert as one of four options: High, Medium, Low, or Informational. |
    | Status | Specify the status of the rule. By default, the status is **Enable.** You can select **Disable** to disable the rule if it generates a large number of false positives. |
    
1. On the **Set rule logic** page, in the **Rule query** section, enter the following query:

    ```kusto
      AzureActivity
      | where OperationName == 'Delete Virtual Machine'
      | where ActivityStatus == 'Accepted'
      | extend AccountCustomEntity = Caller
      | extend IPCustomEntity = CallerIpAddress
    ```

1. In the **Query Scheduling** section, you can configure how often the query should run. Select query to run on every 5 min.
