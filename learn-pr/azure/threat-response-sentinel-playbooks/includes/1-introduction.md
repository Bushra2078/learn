Microsoft Azure Sentinel playbook is a collection of security procedures that you can run in response to alerts. <!--Marjan, I added a single topic sentence that should appear before the scenario. Please review and update as needed-->

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a New York branch office. Contoso uses several Microsoft products and services to implement data security and threat protection for its resources. These products are:

- Microsoft 365
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Azure AD Identity Protection
- Cloud App Security
- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- System Center Endpoint Protection
- Microsoft Azure Information Protection

Contoso provides threat protection for its Azure-based and on-premises resources by using the paid version of Azure Security Center. The company also monitors and protects other non-Microsoft assets.

The Contoso Security Operations (SecOps) team didn't respond quickly enough to the organization's latest security incident. Contoso's IT director wants to implement Azure Sentinel playbooks to help the SecOps team identify and stop potential security threats.

As Contoso's lead security engineer and Azure administrator, you've been tasked with setting up an Azure Sentinel playbook to respond to security incidents.

In this module, you'll learn about the Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) capabilities within Azure Sentinel. You will examine hwo to create and edit Azure Sentinel playbooks, configure their workflow, and manage them.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to set up security playbooks in Azure Sentinel to help the SecOps team respond to alerts effectively.
