A virtual network enables you to implement a security perimeter around your resources in the cloud. You can control the information that flows in and out of a virtual network. You can also restrict access to the network to traffic that originates only from trusted sources.

Suppose that you are the Solution Architect for a retail organization, which recently suffered a security incident that exposed the customer information such as name, address, and credit card. Malicious actors infiltrated vulnerabilities in the retailer's network infrastructure, resulting in the loss of Customers confidential information. The CEO has said that the loss of vital information is embarrassing to a company with a global presence and has demanded action immediately to satisfy customer concerns.

As part of a remediation plan, the security team has recommended putting in additional network protections in the form of network virtual appliances. The cloud infrastructure team needs to ensure that traffic is properly routed through these virtual appliances to be inspected for malicious activity.

In this module, you'll learn about Azure routing, how you can create custom routes to control the flow of network traffic and how you can redirect the traffic through a network virtual appliance so that traffic can be inspected before it's allowed through.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify the routing capabilities of an Azure virtual network
- Configure routing within a virtual network
- Deploy a basic network virtual appliance
- Configure routing to send traffic through a network virtual appliance

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of basic networking concepts, including subnets and IP addressing.
- Familiarity with Azure virtual networking.
