## Title

Protect your APIs on Azure API Management

## Role(s)

- Solution Architect
- Developer

## Level

- Intermediate

## Product(s)

- Azure API Management

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure API Management

## Summary

Protect your back end APIs from information exposure and implement throttling to prevent resource exhaustion with policies in Azure API Management.

## Learning objectives

1. Remove response headers from your APIs
2. Replace URLs in the response body
3. Throttle requests that exceed a threshold

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Protect your APIs on Azure API Management*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    A government agency has created an API to make recent and historical census data available. They want to prevent any unnecessary back end information from being exposed that could lead to malicious attack. They would also like to prevent abuse of the APIs in the form of a large volume of requests, and need a mechanism to throttle requests if they exceed an allowed amount. They are serving their APIs on the Azure API Management service and would like to implement policies to address these concerns.

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
