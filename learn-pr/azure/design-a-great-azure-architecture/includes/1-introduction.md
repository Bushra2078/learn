So you want to build great things on Azure, but you’re not sure exactly what that means. There are a wealth of tools and services at your disposal on Azure, but what’s really important to make sure you’re successful?

Could your architecture handle the failure of one or more critical components? Are you using resources in the most efficient manner possible? Using key principles throughout your architecture, regardless of technology choice, can help you design, build and continuously improve your architecture.
