The preceding information helps you prepare for your first cloud-adoption efforts. To reach true scale in the cloud, you'll need to keep investing in your Azure landing zones to reach operating model requirements for governance, security, and operations management. 

This section of the Ready methodology builds on the principles of [landing zone refactoring](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/refactor). As outlined in that article, a refactoring approach to infrastructure as code removes blockers to business success while minimizing risk. This series of articles assumes that you've deployed your first landing zone and would now like to expand that landing zone to meet enterprise requirements.

## Shared architecture principles

Expanding your landing zone provides a code-first approach to embedding the following principles into the landing zone and more broadly into your overall cloud environment.

These same architecture principles are shared by [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor/advisor-overview), the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/), and the solutions in the [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/).

## Applying these principles to your landing zone improvements

To better align with the methodologies of the Cloud Adoption Framework, the principles above are grouped into actionable landing zone improvements:

- Basic considerations: refactor a landing zone to refine hosting, fundamentals, and other foundational elements.
- Operations expansions: add operations management configurations to improve **performance, reliability, and operational excellence**.
- Governance expansions: add governance configurations to improve **cost, reliability, security**, and consistency.
- Security expansions: add **security** configurations to improve protection of sensitive data and critical systems.

The Cloud Adoption Framework and its associated Learn modules for [Govern](/learn/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-govern/), [Manage](/learn/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-manage/) and [Secure](/learn/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-security/), address each of these requirements in parallel methodologies.
