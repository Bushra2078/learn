Adopting cloud technologies is a journey. Business priorities and the need to bring new technologies online to unlock capabilities or features influence the speed at which an organization deploys and scales out a cloud environment.

Over time, the organization iterates and matures the deployed technologies, processes, and skilling needed to progress toward that destination. This iteration doesn't mean you arrive at the destination immediately, however. The journey takes time. The time varies depending on the size of the organization, the current technical footprint, and the skilling maturity within technical teams.

## On Ramps

Consider an analogy of a trip along a freeway. There might be multiple *on-ramps* you can use to join the freeway, but the *destination* is the same. These on-ramps represent where organizations are today in their cloud adoption plans. They also represent the specific guidance that you need to continue to develop the cloud environment.

## Azure Landing Zone Review

The purpose of the Landing Zone Review is to help you assess your current Azure environment and get customized recommendations for remediating the current state to align with the Azure Landing Zone conceptual architecture.

You can use the transition guidance from the output of the assessment, best practices, and automation guidance, export via Excel, and import to ADO.

Access the Azure Landing Zone Assessment [here](https://aka.ms/LandingZoneReview).
