Adopting cloud technologies is a journey. Business priorities and the need to bring new technologies online to unlock capabilities or features influence the speed at which an organization deploys and scales out a cloud environment.

Over time, the organization iterates and matures the deployed technologies, processes, and skills to progress toward that destination. The time for the overall journey depends on the size of the organization, the current technical footprint, and the maturity of skills in technical teams.

## On-ramps

Consider an analogy of a trip along a freeway. There might be multiple *on-ramps* that you can use to join the freeway, but the *destination* is the same. The following on-ramps represent where organizations are today in their cloud adoption plans. They also represent the specific guidance that you need to continue to develop the cloud environment.

## Landing zone review

The [landing zone review](https://aka.ms/LandingZoneReview) helps you assess your current Azure environment. It also helps you get customized recommendations for remediating the current state to align with the conceptual architecture of Azure landing zones.

You can use the transition guidance from the output of the assessment, best practices, and automation guidance, export via Excel, and import to Azure DevOps.
