Cloud adoption and operations are dependent on your early platform decisions. Compare Azure Landing Zones options to develop the right cloud platform to support your adoption plans and ongoing operations management needs.

In this module, you will compare common operating models and Azure Landing Zone implementation options to find the best path to a fully configured cloud platform. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Compare your operations management, governance, and security requirements to common operating models
- Evaluate Azure Landing Zone implementation options against your short and long-term requirements
- Choose the best Azure Landing Zones & support learn modules to support your cloud adoption needs

## Prerequisites

- Review of the CAF getting started learn module  
- Understanding of your organizationâ€™s cloud adoption strategy
- Familiarity with Azure cloud environment including network configuration, network connectivity, azure active directory
- Familiarity with Azure governance tools including Azure Policy, Azure Blueprints, Azure Resource Manager templates
- General understanding of the environmental requirements needed to proceed with your cloud adoption plan
- Basic understanding of the following two terms:
    - **Azure Landing Zones:** Azure Landing Zones provide an accelerated approach to deploying your cloud platform.

Once deployed the architectures that define Azure Landing Zones can then be modified to meet your business, operations, and technical requirements.
    - **Operating model:** The way you choose to operate and run technology solutions will have a big impact on the design of your environment and the initial architecture you should choose to start environmental configuration. You cloud operating model is the specific way you want to operate assets hosted in the cloud. Aligning to an operating model will help you quickly assess governance, security, and operations management requirements.
