  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following best describes the operating model at Tailwind Traders?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Since all production operations are supported by a centralized team, this isn't an operating model that Tailwind could support.
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: See the last question in the knowledge check to understand why enterprise operations isn't currently a good fit for Tailwind Traders.
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Operations at Tailwind isn't nearly complex enough to fit this operating model.
  - content: In the customer narrative, there is a controlled process for release of the solutions coming from the retail innovation team. If that process were improved to allow that team to manage their own workloads in a controlled landing zone, which operating model would better describe the new arrangement?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The central operations team isn't going away, so decentralized still wouldn't quite fit.
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: When additional teams are allowed to manage production operations, the centralized model becomes unruly. If that increased pace of innovation is required, Tailwind should consider an enterprise operations model.
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fortunately, this change wouldn't suggest a distributed operations approach. Try again.
  - content: Before the retail innovation team was acquired by Tailwind Traders, they were entirely workload focused. Based on our limited knowledge, what operating model best describes how that team operated prior to the acquisition?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Before the acquisition, there were no centralized support services. Try again.
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Enterprise operations would require centralized operations and innovative workload teams. Before the acquisition, there were no centralized support services.
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While the company might become distributed after a few more acquisitions, Tailwind isn't there today, nor was the startup prior to acquisition.
  # - content: Which of the following is an indicator that centralized operations is the better fit for Tailwind Traders?
  #   choices:
  #   - content: Openness to embrace cloud-native operations tools and processes
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: The narrative suggests limited appetite for cloud-native tools and processes. This customer currently needs a best-of-breed approach.
  #   - content: Multiple teams accessing production environments
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: Only the central operations team has access to production. There is no need currently for a more complex approach to separation of duties.
  #   - content: Central operations team size
  #     isCorrect: true
  #     explanation: There are indications that an enterprise operations approach could provide advantages. But the strained staff and lack of well-organized teams outside of central operations would add strain to the current team structure. Organizational change would be required to adopt enterprise operations.
  #   - content: Scope of the portfolio
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: The overall scope of the portfolio is large enough to qualify for enterprise operations. This is an indicator that an enterprise operations approach might be beneficial.
