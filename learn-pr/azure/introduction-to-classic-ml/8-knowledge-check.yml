  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?'
    choices:
    - content: "Supervised learning requires human supervision, while unsupervised learning doesn't"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Supervised learning always uses an optimizer, but unsupervised never does"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Supervised learning trains a model by comparing estimations to correct answers. The cost function for unsupervised learning does not need correct answers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'What is the role of the cost function in supervised learning?'
    choices:
    - content: "To maximize the cost so that the objective is reached."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "To calculate cost by comparing estimations to correct answers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "To update model parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: 'How does gradient descent know how to update parameters?'
    choices:
    - content: "It compares costs for several combinations of parameters, and then selects the best option"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "It uses an internal understanding of the relationship between features and labels to make intelligent choices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "It uses calculus to estimate the slope of the cost function"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Once the slope it known, it is clear whether to make parameters smaller or larger."
  - content: 'Why are there many cost functions available?'
    choices:
    - content: "A unique cost function is required for each processed currency or banking system"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Because cost functions help models process data, and many model types are available"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Models do not rely on other components to make an estimation. That said, cost functions can need slight adjustments so that they are compatible with different types of model output"
    - content: "Because different cost functions can arrive at different answers, and what is best depends on our goal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'Why is learning rate important?'
    choices:
    - content: "It speeds up or slows down training"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "If too large or too small, it can prevent a model from being trained optimally"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Both options are correct "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
