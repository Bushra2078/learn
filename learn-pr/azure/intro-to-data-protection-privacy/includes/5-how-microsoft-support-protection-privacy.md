## Microsoft data categorization

Microsoft uses the following data categorization for online services:

- **Customer data** is all data, including text, sound, video, image files, and software, that customers provide to Microsoft or that is provided on their behalf through their use of Microsoft enterprise online services, excluding Microsoft Professional Services. It also includes customer content, which is the data customers upload for storage or processing and apps customers upload for distribution through a Microsoft enterprise cloud service. For example, customer content includes Microsoft Exchange Online email and attachments, Power BI reports, SharePoint Online site content, and instant-messaging conversations.

- **Diagnostic data** includes all data that's collected or obtained from software that customers locally install for use in connection with Microsoft enterprise online services. Microsoft uses diagnostic data to help ensure that client software is secure and performs correctly. For example, Microsoft collects information about how long it takes to launch an app, whether an add-in has crashed, and the number of sign-in attempts. Diagnostic data is also known as telemetry data, and doesn't include names, email addresses, or file content.

- **Service-generated data** includes all data that Microsoft generates or derives through the operation of an online service. Microsoft derives this data from its online services and uses it to help ensure that performance, security, scaling, and other services that affect customer experiences are working at levels that customers require. For example, to understand how to improve datacenter capacity as a customer's use of Microsoft Teams increases, Microsoft processes log data of their Teams usage. Microsoft then reviews the logs for peak usage times and decides which datacenters to add to meet capacity.

- **System-generated logs** are logs and related data that Microsoft and other vendors generate to help provide enterprise services to users. System-generated logs contain primarily pseudonymized data, which is data that's replaced by one or more artificial identifiers or pseudonyms. Unique identifiers are an example of pseudonymized data, which are typically a number that a system generates that can't identify an individual person. System-generated logs might also contain identifiable information about end users, such as a username.

- **Professional services data** is all data provided to or processed by Microsoft, upon authorization and through a customer engagement with Microsoft to obtain professional services. Professional services data includes data that customers provide to Microsoft during technical support for online services. Examples include text, sound, video, image files, or software provided to Microsoft during troubleshooting.

- **Administrator data** is information about administrators that's supplied during sign up, purchase, or administration of Microsoft services, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. Administrator data also includes aggregated usage information and data associated with your account, such as the controls you select. Microsoft uses administrator data to provide services, complete transactions, service accounts, and detect and prevent fraud.

- **Payment data** is the information customers provide when they buy something online with Microsoft. Payment data might include a credit card number and security code, name, billing address, and other financial information. Microsoft uses payment data to complete transactions and to detect and prevent fraud.

- **Personal data** includes any information that pertains to an identified or identifiable natural person, including pseudonymized data. Microsoft uses the same definition for personal data as the GDPR. Personal data is a subset of each of the preceding data categories.
