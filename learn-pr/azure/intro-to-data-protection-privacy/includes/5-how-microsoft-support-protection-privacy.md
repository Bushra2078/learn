You can use Microsoft products and platforms to help support data protection and achieve compliance with privacy laws and regulations.

## DPO

Microsoft has a designated EU DPO who is an independent advisor for its engineering and business groups. The DPO helps ensure that all proposed processing of personal data meets EU legal requirements and Microsoft corporate standards. The design of the DPO role meets GDPR criteria mandated in Articles 37-39. The EU DPO reports directly to the Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer, who's a senior executive within the Microsoft Corporate and Legal Affairs division. The DPO role has autonomy to perform functions in an independent, unbiased manner. Through the Chief Privacy Officer's organization, the DPO has access to training and customer-response resources so they can perform their duties.

## Process of completing DSRs

Microsoft products, services, and administrative tools can be used to help organizations find and act on personal data to respond to data subject requests (DSRs):

- Discovery. Use search and discovery tools to find customer data that might be the subject of a DSR. After collecting potentially responsive documents, you can perform the DSR actions described in the following steps. Alternatively, you might decide that the request doesn't meet your organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs.

- Access. Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested, make a copy of it available to the data subject.

- Rectification. Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data, where applicable.

- Restriction. Restrict processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for various Azure services or turning off desired services, if possible. You can also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and keep it on-premises or at another location.

- Deletion. Permanently remove personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud.

- Exporting and receiving (portability). Provide an electronic copy of personal data or personal information in a machine-readable format to the data subject. Per the CCPA, personal information is any data relating to an identified or identifiable person. There's no distinction between a person's private, public, or work role. The defined term, “personal information,” corresponds with “personal data” under the GDPR. However, the CCPA also includes family and household data.

## Data categorization

Microsoft uses its own data categorization for online services. The categories are:

- Customer data. Customer data is all data, including text, sound, video, image files, and software that you provide to Microsoft or that is provided on your behalf through your use of Microsoft enterprise online services, excluding Microsoft Professional Services. It also includes customer content, which is the data you upload for storage or processing and apps you upload for distribution through a Microsoft enterprise cloud service. For example, customer content includes Microsoft Exchange Online email and attachments, Power BI reports, SharePoint Online site content, and instant-messaging conversations.

- Diagnostic data. Diagnostic data includes all data that's collected or obtained from software that you locally install for use in connection with Microsoft enterprise online services. Microsoft uses diagnostic data to help ensure that client software is secure and performing correctly. For example, Microsoft collects information about how long it takes to launch an app, whether an add-in has crashed, and the number of sign-in attempts. Diagnostic data is also known as telemetry data, and does not include names, email addresses, or file content.

- Service-generated data. Service-generated data includes all data that Microsoft generates or derives through the operation of an online service. Microsoft derives this data from its online services and uses it to help ensure that performance, security, scaling, and other services that affect customer experiences are working at levels that customers require. For example, to understand how to improve datacenter capacity as a customer's use of Microsoft Teams increases, Microsoft processes log data of their Teams usage. Microsoft then reviews the logs for peak usage times and decides which datacenters to add to meet capacity.

- System-generated logs. Microsoft and other vendors generate logs and related data that help provide enterprise services to users. System-generated logs contain primarily pseudonymized data, which is data that's replaced by one or more artificial identifiers or pseudonyms. Unique identifiers are an example of pseudonymized data. They're typically a number that a system generates that can't identify an individual person. They're used to deliver enterprise services to users. System-generated logs might also contain identifiable information about end users, such as a username.

- Professional services data. Professional services data is all data, provided to Microsoft, or processed by Microsoft, upon authorization and through a customer engagement with Microsoft to obtain Professional Services. Additionally, it includes data that customers provide to Microsoft during technical support for online services. Examples include text, sound, video, image files, or software provided to Microsoft during troubleshooting.

- Administrator data. Administrator data is information about administrators that's supplied during sign up, purchase, or administration of Microsoft services, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. It also includes aggregated usage information and data associated with your account, such as the controls you select. Microsoft uses administrator data to provide services, complete transactions, service the account, and detect and prevent fraud.

- Payment data. Payment data is the information you provide when you buy something online with Microsoft. It might include a credit card number and security code, name, billing address, and other financial information. Microsoft uses payment data to complete transactions and to detect and prevent fraud.

- Personal data. Personal data includes any information that pertains to an identified or identifiable natural person, including pseudonymized data. Microsoft uses the same definition for personal data as the GDPR. Personal data is a subset of each of the data categories listed here.

## Microsoft's GDPR commitments to customers

Microsoft believes that privacy is a fundamental right and the GDPR is crucial for helping protect and enable individuals' privacy rights. Microsoft is committed to complying with the GDPR. It provides an array of products, features, documentation, and resources that support its customers in meeting GDPR compliance obligations.

The GDPR requires that controllers (such as organizations and developers using Microsoft’s enterprise online services) only use processors (such as Microsoft) that:

- Process personal data on the controller’s behalf.

- Provide sufficient guarantees to meet key GDPR requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft has been proactive in providing these commitments to all enterprise online service customers as part of their subscription agreements and to volume-licensing customers as part of their enterprise agreements.

The Microsoft GDPR terms reflect the commitments that GDPR Article 28 requires of processors, including that they:

- Only use subprocessors with the consent of the controller and remain liable for subprocessors.

- Process personal data only on instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers.

- Ensure that people who process personal data are committed to confidentiality.

- Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that help ensure a level of personal data security appropriate to the risk.

- Help the controller meet its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests to exercise their GDPR rights.

- Meet the GDPR’s breach notification and assistance requirements.

- Assist the controller with data-protection impact assessments and consultation with supervisory authorities.

- Delete or return personal data at the end of provision of services.

- Support the controller with evidence of GDPR compliance.
