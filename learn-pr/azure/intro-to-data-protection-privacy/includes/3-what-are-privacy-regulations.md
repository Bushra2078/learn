Worldwide, many laws and regulations address data protection and privacy. The two most widely applied privacy laws are the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). 

- The GDPR is a regulation that governs data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA).
- The CCPA is a California state privacy law and the first comprehensive privacy law in the United States.

This unit describes the GDPR, its concepts and terminology, and how Microsoft supports the GDPR and associated data subject requests (DSRs). The next unit provides more information about the CCPA and how it compares to the GDPR.

## Overview of the GDPR

The GDPR governs the use and treatment of personal data by organizations that offer goods and services to EU residents or monitor their behavior, regardless of where those organizations are located. The GDPR also gives individuals certain rights to manage their personal data that an organization collects.

> [!NOTE]
> The GDPR applies more broadly than might be apparent at first glance. Unlike privacy laws in some other jurisdictions, the GDPR is applicable to organizations of all sizes and all industries. The GDPR may apply to your organization even if it doesn't have a physical presence in the EU. To understand if the GDPR applies to your organization, you should work closely with your legal team.

The GDPR updates and expands on the earlier Data Protection Directive, which was enacted in 1995. One of the GDPR's goals is to strengthen personal data protections for EU residents by focusing on the privacy and usage of an individual's personal data. While the GDPR preserves many of the principles established in the Directive, the GDPR gives individuals greater control over their personal data and imposes many new obligations on organizations that collect, handle, or analyze personal data.

In the context of GDPR, you can think of data as having a lifecycle that starts when you collect data, continues as you store and use it (processing), and ends when you delete it from your systems. The GDPR sets out data handling requirements and advises on how to achieve them. The GDPR also gives regulators new powers to impose significant fines on organizations that breach the law. The GDPR became enforceable in May 2018.

## GDPR concepts and terminology

To understand the GDPR, it's important to know the following concepts and terms:

- **Personal data** under the GDPR is any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. If data is linked or linkable to an identifiable individual, the GDPR considers it personal data. Common examples of personal data include name, address, date of birth, and IP address. The GDPR also considers *pseudonymous* information, regardless of how obscure or technical it is, to be personal data if it's linked to an individual.

- **Sensitive personal data** under the GDPR is personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. Sensitive personal data also includes genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health, or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation. The GDPR introduces more obligations for processing this data.

- A **controller** is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that, either alone or jointly with others, decides the purposes of, and processing methods for, personal data. The processing purposes and means are determined by the controller, by Union or Member State law, or by specific criteria for nomination that's provided by Union or Member State law.

- A **processor** is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of a controller.

- **Legal basis for processing** means that under the GDPR, organizations must be able to point to a legal basis for processing personal data. The GDPR provides six grounds for processing, including when the processing is necessary to perform a contract, when an individual has consented to the processing of their data, or when the processing is in the organizationâ€™s legitimate interest, provided that interest isn't outweighed by the individual's rights.

- **Data subject rights** under the GDPR give individuals certain rights with respect to an organization's or controller's use of their personal data. Under certain circumstances, individuals can file the following DSRs for their personal data that an organization stores, processes, and transmits.

  - **Access data.** Individuals have a right to know whether an organization is processing their data and if so, to have access to that data.
  - **Ask for data rectification.** Individuals can request that a company correct inaccurate data about the individual.
  - **Ask for data deletion.** Also known as the *right to erasure*, this right allows an individual to request deletion of their personal data that a company has collected.
  - **Request restricted processing.** An individual can ask that a company suppress or restrict the processing of their data.
  - **Request data portability.** An individual can ask for their data to be transferred to another company or processing system.
  - **Object.** An individual can object to their data being used for various uses, including direct marketing.
  - **Ask not to be subject to automated decision making, including profiling.** The GDPR has strict rules about using data to profile people and making decisions based solely on automated processing.
  
## Microsoft support for the GDPR

Microsoft believes that privacy is a fundamental right and the GDPR is crucial for helping protect and enable individuals' privacy rights. Microsoft is committed to complying with the GDPR, and provides an array of products, features, documentation, and resources to support its customers in meeting GDPR compliance obligations.

The GDPR requires that controllers, such as organizations and developers that use Microsoft's online services, must process personal data only on the controller's behalf, and must provide sufficient guarantees to meet GDPR requirements.

### Designated EU DPO

Microsoft has a designated EU data protection officer (DPO) who's an independent advisor for its engineering and business groups. The DPO helps ensure that all proposed processing of personal data meets EU legal requirements and Microsoft corporate standards. The design of the DPO role meets GDPR criteria mandated in Articles 37-39.

The EU DPO reports directly to the Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer, who's a senior executive within the Microsoft Corporate and Legal Affairs division. The DPO role has autonomy to perform functions in an independent, unbiased manner. Through the Chief Privacy Officer's organization, the DPO has access to training and customer-response resources so they can perform their duties.

### GDPR commitments and terms

The Microsoft GDPR terms reflect the following commitments that GDPR Article 28 requires of processors. Microsoft has been proactive in providing these commitments to all enterprise online service customers as part of their subscription agreements, and to volume-licensing customers as part of their enterprise agreements.

- Only use subprocessors with the consent of the controller, and remain liable for subprocessors.
- Process personal data only on instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers.
- Ensure that people who process personal data are committed to confidentiality.
- Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that help ensure a level of personal data security appropriate to the risk.
- Help the controller meet its obligations to respond to data subjects' requests to exercise their GDPR rights.
- Meet the GDPR's breach notification and assistance requirements.
- Assist the controller with data-protection impact assessments and consultation with supervisory authorities.
- Delete or return personal data at the end of provision of services.
- Support the controller with evidence of GDPR compliance.

### DSR completion support

Microsoft has products, services, and administrative tools that help organizations respond to the following DSRs:

- **Discovery.** You can use search and discovery tools to find customer data that might be the subject of a DSR. After collecting potentially responsive documents, you can do other DSR actions. You might also decide that the request doesn't meet your organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs.
- **Access.** Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested, make a copy of it available to the data subject.
- **Rectification.** Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data, where applicable.
- **Restriction.** Restrict processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for various Azure services or turning off certain services. You can also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and keep it on-premises or at another location.
- **Deletion.** Permanently remove personal data from the Microsoft cloud.
- **Exporting and receiving (portability).** Provide an electronic copy of personal data or personal information in a machine-readable format to the data subject.
