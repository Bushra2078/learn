Business and personal data is extremely valuable. Unauthorized disclosure or access, processing, or use of personal or business data can cause large losses for individuals and companies.

An ever-increasing amount of data resides in many locations, such as devices, an organization's file servers, and cloud storage services. Data can also be accessed from various locations, by using many different devices. The risk of data leakage, misuse, and loss is greater than ever before.

It's important for companies and individuals to understand the need for data protection and learn necessary skills to help protect their data. The importance of data protection increases as the amount or sensitivity of data that's created and stored grows.

## Data protection and data privacy

*Data protection* relates to helping protect data from unlawful or unauthorized access, use, destruction, damage, or loss. *Data privacy* focuses on the collection, use, and permissible handling of personal data, and what rights an individual has to control the data that's been collected about them.

Data protection generally pertains to technical control over data. Data privacy typically refers to legal or regulatory requirements. Data protection doesn't ensure data privacy or vice versa.

## Data protection

Data protection consists of processes, procedures, and technologies that can help safeguard valuable information from corruption, compromise, or loss. It's important to recognize that no single product or technology can guarantee data protection in every scenario. Rather, a combination of available procedures, technologies, and products might be necessary to help protect data.

To help implement data protection, consider the following factors:

- **The sensitivity of the data type.** Not all data may need the same level of protection or benefit from the same data protection approach. For example, some personal data such as email addresses might not require the same protection as sensitive data like social security numbers and health information.

- **Where the data is stored.** Appropriate data-protection technologies and methods might depend on where your data is stored. For example, you might not use the same approach to help protect data stored on your mobile device that you would for data stored on your company's file server or in the cloud.

- **Applicable data-protection requirements and regulations.** Laws and regulations may define specific data-protection requirements. You should work with your legal representation to ensure you have a solid knowledge of these requirements and how they apply to your business.

- **Technologies that enable data protection.** No single technology ensures complete data protection for every scenario. To help protect your data efficiently, become familiar with the available platforms, processes, and technologies appropriate for your specific needs.

### Key data protection principles

No single approach or technology guarantees data protection. However, the following key principles are important in designing a data-protection strategy.

- Implement some level of data protection at data creation or collection that persists with the data throughout its lifecycle.
- Ensure that employees understand data sharing, including awareness of what data they share, who they share it with, and how they share it. Controlling data access and sharing is a key part of data protection.
- In addition to protecting specific data, you must protect user identities, the devices on which users access data, and your network traffic.

## Data privacy

Data privacy typically addresses questions such as:

- Who can collect data.
- Who can access data.
- What an organization can do with the data they've collected.
- How long an organization can retain data.
- The level of control an individual has over their data.

Various laws around the world describe the rights of people and companies to control who's using their data. Privacy laws and regulations generally set forth requirements that must be followed when handling different types of data.

### Privacy laws and regulations

Many countries/regions, and in some cases specific states, have laws or regulations that address privacy and the protection of personal data. Examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The following units provide more detail about these two privacy laws.

In general, privacy law and regulations set forth a legal framework about how organizations, and in some cases, individuals, can collect, use, and store personal data. In most cases, laws and regulations don't define or prescribe specific technologies that organizations must use to protect data. Organizations must identify compliant technologies, operations, and other appropriate data-protection measures.

### Considerations for defining compliance

The design of your organization's internal data-handling policies should reflect the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to your organization and the data being handled. Your internal compliance framework should focus on principles and procedures for data access, use, and protection.

Data protection officers (DPOs) must understand data-handling requirements based on their state and country/region's laws and regulations and their organization's internal policies. This understanding can help DPOs define appropriate procedures and technologies for data collection, storage, and protection.

Microsoft provides compliance offerings that can help your organization align with national/regional and industry-specific data collection and usage requirements. A later unit describes these offerings.
