To know how to comply with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, you must understand key data-processing concepts and components.

## Key GDPR concepts

The GDPR gives people rights to manage all personal data that an employer, agency, or organization collects from them. The GDPR defines:

- People as "data subjects."

- An employer, agency, or organization as "data controller" or "controller."

- Personal data as data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.

It further gives data subjects specific rights to their personal data, including the right to:

- Obtain copies of personal data collected.

- Request corrections to it.

- Restrict its processing.

- Delete it.

- Receive it in an electronic format so they can move it to another controller.

A data subject request (DSR) is a formal request by a data subject to a controller, asking that they act on their personal data.

## Key concepts of CCPA

The CCPA mandates privacy rights and obligations to Californian consumers that are like the GDPR's data subject rights. The CCPA also dictates certain disclosures, protections against discrimination, and "opt-out/ opt-in" requirements for certain data transfers classified as "sales."

### GDPR vs. CCPA

Similarities between GDPR and CCPA include:

- They both mandate transparency and disclosure obligations.

- They both provide consumer rights to access, delete, and receive a copy of data.

- The CCPA definition of service providers is comparable to how GDPR defines processors with a similar contractual obligation.

- The CCPA definition of businesses encompasses the GDPR definition of controllers.

<!--ID/SME, please review the following sentences, as I added a description of "valuable consideration" and also tweaked the original sentences. --> There is one significant difference between the GDPR and CCPA. The CCPA has a core requirement that enables consumers to opt-out from the sale of their personal data to third parties. The term *sale* broadly includes data sharing for valuable consideration, which refers to a party either receiving a benefit or incurring a loss for something received or promised.

## Data processing

Important data-processing terms to know include:

- Controller. A controller is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body. A controller, either alone or jointly with others, decides the purposes of, and processing methods for, personal data. These processing purposes and means are determined by Union or Member State law, a controller, or specific criteria for its nomination that's provided by Union or Member State law.

-	Personal data and data subject. Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person or data subject. An identifiable natural person is someone who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by referring to:

    - An identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, or an online classification.
  
    - One or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
  
- Processor. A natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of a controller.

- Customer data. All data--including text, sound, video, image files, or software--that's furnished by, or on behalf of, a customer through an enterprise service. Customer data includes:

  - Identifiable information of end users, such as usernames and contact information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

  - Customer content that they upload to, or create in, specific services. Examples include customer content in an Azure Storage account, customer content of an Azure SQL database, or a customer's virtual machine (VM) image in Azure Virtual Machines.
  
- System-generated logs. Microsoft and other vendors generate logs and related data that help provide enterprise services to users. System-generated logs contain primarily pseudonymized data, which is data that's replaced by one or more artificial identifiers or pseudonyms. An example of pseudonymized data is unique identifiers. A unique identifier typically is a number that a system generates that can't identify an individual person. However, it's used to deliver enterprise services to users. System-generated logs might also contain identifiable information about end users, such as a username.

## Process of completing DSRs

A controller must promptly consider each DSR and produce a substantive response, either by taking the requested action or providing an explanation about why they can't accommodate the DSR. A controller should consult with their own legal or compliance advisers about the proper disposition of a DSR. Completing a DSR might involve several processes that are subject to your organization's GDPR compliance rules, including:

-	Discovery. Use search and discovery tools to find customer data that might be the subject of a DSR. After collecting potentially responsive documents, you can perform one or more of the DSR actions described in the following steps to respond. Alternatively, you might decide that the request doesn't meet your organization's guidelines for responding to DSRs.

- Access. Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested, make a copy of it available to the data subject.

- Rectification. Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data, where applicable.

- Restriction. Restrict processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for various Azure services or turning off the desired services, where possible. You can also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and keep it on-premises or at another location.

- Deletion. Permanently remove personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud.

- Exporting and receiving (portability). Provide an electronic copy of personal data or personal information in a machine-readable format to the data subject. Per the CCPA, personal information is any data relating to an identified or identifiable person. There's no distinction between a person's private, public, or work role. The defined term, "personal information," corresponds with "personal data" under the GDPR. However, the CCPA also includes family and household data.
