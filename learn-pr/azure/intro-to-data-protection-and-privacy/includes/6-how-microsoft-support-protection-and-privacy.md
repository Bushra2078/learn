You can use Microsoft 365 to help you achieve compliance with the GDPR and with other regulations.

## DPO

Microsoft has designated an EU data protection officer (DPO) to be an independent advisor for Microsoft's engineering and business groups. The DPO helps ensure that all proposed processing of personal data meets EU legal requirements and Microsoft's corporate standards. The DPO’s role was designed to meet the GDPR criteria set out in Articles 37-39. The EU DPO reports directly to Microsoft's Chief Privacy Officer, who is a senior executive within Microsoft's Corporate and Legal Affairs division. The DPO role has autonomy to perform functions in an independent, unbiased manner. Through the Chief Privacy Officer's organization, the DPO has access to training and customer response resources as necessary to perform their duties. The DPO is bound by confidentiality with a non-disclosure agreement.

## Data categorization

Microsoft uses its own data categorization for online services. These categories are:

- Customer data. Customer data is all data, including text, sound, video, image files, and software that you provide to Microsoft directly, or through your use of Microsoft enterprise online services, excluding Microsoft Professional Services. It includes customer content, which is the data you upload for storage or processing and the apps you upload for distribution through a Microsoft enterprise cloud service. For example, customer content includes Microsoft Exchange Online email and attachments, Microsoft Power BI reports, Microsoft SharePoint Online site content, and instant messaging conversations.

- Diagnostic data. Diagnostic data includes all the data that's collected or obtained from software that you locally install for use in connection with Microsoft enterprise online services. Microsoft uses diagnostic data to help ensure the client software is secure and performing properly. For example, Microsoft collects information about how long it takes to launch an app, add-in failures, and the number of sign-in attempts. Diagnostic data can also be referred to as telemetry data, and doesn't include names, email addresses, or file content.

- Service-generated data. Service-generated data includes all the data that Microsoft generates or derives through the operation of an online service. Microsoft aggregates this data from its online services and uses it to make sure performance, security, scaling, and other services that impact the customer experience are operating at the levels that customers require. For example, to understand how to ramp up datacenter capacity as a customer's use of Microsoft Teams increases, Microsoft processes log data of their Teams usage. Microsoft then reviews the logs for peak times and decide which datacenters to add to meet this capacity.

- Professional services data. Professional services data is all the data that customers provide to Microsoft, or that Microsoft processes, upon authorization and through an engagement with Microsoft to obtain professional services. Professional services data includes support data that customers provide to Microsoft during technical support for an online service. Examples include text, sound, video, image files, or software provided to Microsoft during troubleshooting.

- Administrator data. Administrator data is information about administrators that's supplied during signup, purchase, or administration of Microsoft services, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. It also includes aggregated usage information and data that's associated with your account, such as the controls you select. Microsoft uses administrator data to provide services, complete transactions, service the account, and detect and prevent fraud.

- Payment data. Payment data is the information you provide when you buy a Microsoft product online. It might include a credit card number and security code, name, billing address, and other financial data. Microsoft uses payment data to complete transactions and to detect and prevent fraud.

- Personal data. Personal data includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Microsoft uses the same GDPR definition for personal data. It includes pseudonymized data. In addition to being a subset of administrator data and payment data, personal data is a subset of each of the data categories presented in this list.

## Microsoft's GDPR commitments to customers

The EU’s GDPR sets a new bar globally for privacy rights, information security, and compliance. Microsoft believes that privacy is a fundamental right and that the GDPR is an important step forward in protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals. Microsoft is committed to its own compliance with the GDPR and providing an array of products, features, documentation, and resources that support its customers in meeting their compliance obligations under the GDPR. Following is a description of Microsoft’s contractual commitments to its customers concerning their personal data that's collected from enterprise software.

The GDPR requires that controllers (such as organizations and developers using Microsoft’s enterprise online services) only use processors (such as Microsoft) that:

- Process personal data on the controller’s behalf.

- Provide sufficient guarantees to meet key requirements of the GDPR.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft has taken the proactive step of providing these commitments to all enterprise online service customers as part of their subscription agreements and to volume-licensing customers as part of their enterprise agreements. Customers of other available enterprise software that Microsoft or its affiliates have licensed, also enjoy the benefits of Microsoft’s GDPR commitments, to the extent the software processes personal data.

Microsoft’s GDPR Terms reflect the commitments required of processors in Article 28 of the GDPR. Article 28 requires that processors commit to:

- Only use subprocessors with the consent of the controller and remain liable for subprocessors.

- Process personal data only on instructions from the controller, including transfers.

- Ensure that persons who process personal data are committed to confidentiality.

- Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of personal data security that's appropriate to the risk.

- Assist the controller in its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests to exercise their GDPR rights.

- Meet the GDPR’s breach notification and assistance requirements.

- Assist the controller with data protection impact assessments and consultation with supervisory authorities.

- Delete or return personal data at the end of provision of services.

- Support the controller with evidence of compliance with the GDPR.

## Microsoft and the CCPA

For commercial customers doing business in California, Microsoft will be acting as a service provider with respect to its Online Services and Professional Services offering. The Online Services Terms and the Microsoft Professional Services Data Protection Addendum already meet the requirements for Service Providers under the CCPA. As set out in the Online Services Terms, Microsoft complies with all laws and regulations applicable to its provision of Online Services, and this includes the CCPA. This is sufficient to permit customers to continue to transfer data to Microsoft’s Online Services. As such, no additional contractual changes are required for customers to be able to rely on Microsoft as a Service Provider under the CCPA.

## Microsoft principles for protecting and governing data

When dealing with customer data, Microsoft follows six key privacy principles that the following table describes.
