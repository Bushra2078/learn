Data is everywhere. It’s on your devices, your organization’s file servers, and on various cloud storage services. Both business and personal data now reside on many different locations and data leakage, data misuse, and data loss are more probable than ever before. At the same time, data is becoming increasingly valuable. Unauthorized, careless, or ignorant processing and use of personal or business data can cause considerable loss to individuals and companies.

Data protection, on any level, is important for companies and persons. People need to be aware of the need for data protection and have the appropriate skills to help protect data. The importance of data protection increases as the amount of data that's created and stored continues to grow exponentially.

Another important consideration is that data is being accessed from everywhere. Individuals and organizations store ever-increasing amounts of data in the cloud and access it from various locations by using many different types of devices. These devices and locations also play an important role in Contoso’s data protection strategy.

## What is data protection?

*Data protection* represents a set of processes, procedures, and technologies that help safeguard important information from corruption, compromise, or loss. However, it’s also important to understand that there’s no single product or technology that you can use to protect data on any place or device. Rather, data protection is an ecosystem that consists of awareness, procedures, technologies, and products.

To efficiently implement data protection, you should:

- Understand the type of data that you want to protect. Not all data needs protection nor can you use the same approach to protect every data type. For example, personal data might not require the same protection as business data.

- Know the locations where your data resides. Data protection technologies and methods sometime depend on a data location. For example, you might not use the same approach to protect data on your mobile device, data on your company’s file server, and data in the cloud.

- Understand data protection requirements and regulations. Often, laws, regulations, or policies define data protection requirements. To efficiently implement data protection, you should have a good understanding of these requirements.

- Be familiar with technologies that enable data protection. As mentioned before, there is no single technology that enables data protection in any scenario. To efficiently protect your data, you should be familiar with the most commonly used platforms, processes, and technologies.

## Data protection vs. data privacy
It’s also important to understand the difference between data protection and data privacy. Data protection focuses on protecting data from unauthorized use, leakage, or loss, while data privacy focuses on managing access to data.

Data privacy defines:

- Who can collect the data.

- Who can access the data.

- What they can do with the data.

- The level of control you have over the retention and use of data.

> [!NOTE]
> In general, data protection is mostly technical control over data, while data privacy is more of a process or legal matter. Data protection does not ensure data privacy or vice versa. You should implement data protection and data privacy together as a proper control mechanism.

## Key principles for data protection
Although there is no unique approach or single technology for data protection, there are some common key principles that you should follow when designing your data protection strategy. These principles include:

- Data protection must exist at the time of data creation and that protection should stay with the data through its entire lifecycle. For example, it's especially important that data stays protected when an employee shares it within the same organization or sends it to someone outside the organization.

- A good understanding of the mechanics of data sharing, which is common between multiple people and organizations. However, at any moment, as a data protection officer, you need to know all the aspects of data sharing. You should also be aware of the data that’s being shared and how it’s being shared. Access control management is one of the key components of data protection.

- Data protection is not achievable by only implementing appropriate technologies on any specific data that you want to protect. To achieve comprehensive data protection, you should also protect user identities, the devices that users use to access data, and the network traffic.
