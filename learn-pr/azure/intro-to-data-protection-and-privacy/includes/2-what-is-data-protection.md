In today's world data is everywhere. It is stored on your mobile device, your laptop, your desktop computer, file server in your company and on various cloud storage services. Both business and personal data now reside on many different locations.  Consequently, data leakage, data misuse and data loss are more probable than ever before.  At the same time, data is becoming more and more valuable. Unauthorized, careless or ignorant processing and usage of personal or business data can cause severe damage to persons and to companies.

Because of this, data protection, on any level, is very important for companies and persons. People needs appropriate skills to protect data, as well as awareness for the need for data protection. The importance of data protection increases as the amount of data created and stored continues to grow exponentially.

Not less important, data is being accessed from everywhere. More and more data is stored in a cloud, and being accessed from various types of devices and from various locations. Devices and locations from which data is accessed also play important role in data protection strategy.

## What is data protection?

A common definition of data protection is that it represents a *set of processes, procedures and technologies for safeguarding important information from corruption, compromise or loss*.  Having said this, it is important to understand that there is no single product or technology that enables you to protect data on any place or device. Data protection is rather an ecosystem that consists of awareness, procedures, technologies and products. 

To efficiently implement data protection, you need to:

- **Understand the type of data that you want to protect** - not all data needs to be protected and not each data type is protected by using the same approach. For example, personal data might not be protected in a same way as business data.
- **Know locations where your data reside** - data protection technologies and methods sometime depends on a data location. For example, you might not use the same approach to protect data on your mobile device and data stored on your company file server or in a cloud.
- **Understand data protection requirements and regulations** - Very often, data protection requirements are defined by laws, regulations or policies. You need to understand these so you can efficiently implement data protection.
- **Be familiar with technologies that enable data protection** - as said before, there is no single technology that enable data protection in any scenario. You need to be familiar with most commonly used platforms, processes and technologies to efficiently protect your data.

When it comes to data protection, it is also important to understand the difference between data protection and data privacy. Data protection is focused on protecting data from unauthorized use, leakage or loss while data privacy is focused on managing access to data. Data privacy defines who can collect the data, access the data, what can be done with it and what control you have over the retention and use of data. 

In general, we can say that data protection is mostly a technical control over a data, while data privacy is more of a process or legal matter. Data protection does not ensure data privacy or vice versa. Data protection and data privacy need to be implemented together as a proper control mechanism.

## Key principles for data protection

Although there is no unique approach or single technology for data protection, there are some common key principles that you should follow when designing your data protection strategy.

- Data must be protected at the time of creation and the protection should stay with the data through its whole lifecycle. For example, it is very important that data stay protected when sent internally to another employee within the same organization or sent to someone outside the organization.

- You need to understand how data is shared. It is very common that data is shared between multiple people or organizations. However, in any moment, data protection officers need to know all aspects of data sharing and have visibility into what data is shared and how itâ€™s being shared. Access control management is one of the key components of data protection.

- Data is not protected only by implementing appropriate technologies on the specific data you want to protect. In order to achieve comprehensive data protection, you should also protect user identities, devices used to access data as well as network traffic.
