Data is everywhere. It’s on your devices, your organization’s file servers, and on various cloud-storage services. Business and personal data often resides in many locations. Therefore, data leakage, misuse, and loss are more probable than ever before. At the same time, data typically is extremely valuable. Unauthorized, careless, or ignorant processing and use of personal or business data potentially can cause considerable losses for individuals and companies.

That's why data protection is important for companies and individuals. People should understand the need for data protection and learn necessary skills to help protect data. The importance of data protection increases as the amount of data that's created and stored grows exponentially.

Another important consideration is that we're accessing data from everywhere. Individuals and organizations store ever-increasing amounts of data in the cloud and access it from various locations, using many different devices. These devices and locations also play a key role in Contoso’s data-protection strategy.

*Data protection* is a set of processes, procedures, and technologies that help safeguard valuable information from corruption, compromise, or loss. It's important to recognize that there’s no one product or technology that guarantees data protection at any location or on any device. Rather, you need to know about the available procedures, technologies, and products to help protect your data.

To help implement data protection, you should consider:

- The type of data that you want to help protect. Not all data needs the same level of protection nor can you use the same approach to help protect every data type. For example, personal data might not require the same protection as business data.

- Where your data is. Available data-protection technologies and methods often depend on your data's location. For example, you might not use the same approach to help protect data on your mobile device that you would for data on your company’s file server or in the cloud.

- Applicable data-protection requirements and regulations. Laws, regulations, and policies often define data-protection requirements. To efficiently help implement data protection, you should work with your legal representation to ensure you have a solid knowledge of these requirements.

- Technologies that enable data protection. Again, there isn't a single technology that enables data protection in any scenario. To help protect your data efficiently, you should be familiar with the most common platforms, processes, and technologies that apply to your situation.

## Data protection vs. data privacy
It’s also important to know the difference between data protection and data privacy. Data protection usually pertains to helping protect data from unauthorized use, leakage, or loss. Data privacy generally focuses on managing access to, and the use of, data.

Data privacy typically refers to:

- Who can collect data.

- Who can access data.

- What a user can do with data.

- The level of control a user has over data retention and use.

> [!NOTE]
> Data protection generally pertains to technical control over data. Data privacy typically refers to legal or regulatory requirements. Data protection doesn't ensure data privacy or vice versa.

## Key principles for data protection
There isn't a single approach or technology that guarantees data protection. However, there are common key principles you should consider as you design your data-protection strategy, including:

- Some data protection should exist when data creation occurs. That protection should persist with the data through its entire lifecycle. For example, you might want data to remain protected regardless of whether an employee shares it within, or outside, your organization.

- An organization's employees should have a good understanding of how data sharing might occur. This includes being aware of what data they're sharing and how. Helping control data access is a key part of data protection.

- You can't achieve good data protection only by implementing technologies on specific data that you want to help protect. You also must help protect user identities, the devices on which users are accessing data, and your network traffic.
