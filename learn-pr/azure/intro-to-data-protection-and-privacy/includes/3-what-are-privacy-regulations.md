In many cases, internal, external, or public policies, regulations, and laws define data protection requirements. For example, a company can define an internal data protection policy to protect its intellectual property. The company can also define an external policy for its vendors to specify how they should manage data when doing business with the company.

## Overview of privacy regulations

A country/region can define a law or regulation that defines how government authorities or companies that process personal data, collect, and manage that personal data. Examples of these regulations are General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which the next units discuss in more detail.

In general, information privacy, data privacy, or data protection regulations and laws provide a legal framework on how to obtain, use, and store data about persons, companies, or other entities. Laws and regulations rarely define or prescribe specific technologies that you can use to protect data. Instead, you should choose appropriate technologies, platforms, or vendors that comply with a specific regulation or law.

The various laws around the world describe the rights of persons and companies to control who is using their data. This usually includes the right to get details on:

- The data that's being stored.

- The purpose of data storage.

- Requesting deletion if the purpose of data storage is not valid anymore.

## Considerations for defining compliant procedures

Data protection policies that companies use internally mostly focus on the principles and procedures for data access management and data protection. At the same time, laws and regulations in this field strongly focus on data collection and data usage. Regulations very specifically define the who, when, and how of personal data collection. They also define how the data should be used and removed or deleted.

Very often, organizations implement government-provided data privacy and protection regulations and internal data protection policies. Data protection officers must have a good understanding of the requirements according to their country/region’s laws and regulations and their organization’s internal policies. Based on this understanding, define procedures for data collection, storage, and protection and the use of technologies for their implementation.
