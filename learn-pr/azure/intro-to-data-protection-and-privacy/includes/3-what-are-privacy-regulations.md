Data-protection requirements will vary depending on an organization's needs. Internal, external, and public policies and laws can help define these requirements. For example, a company might define an internal data-protection policy to protect its intellectual property. The company also might define an external policy that applies to its vendors and how they must manage data when doing business with the company. <!-- ID/SME: Per CELA's review, they suggest the following: "This only talks about company policies. Because this is a section about “privacy regulations,” you may want to describe what these generally are in the intro." !-->

## Overview of privacy regulations

A country/region can define laws or regulations about data collection and management. The governmental authorities or companies that are based in the country/region must follow these laws or regulations. Examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Subsequent units provide more detail about this two examples. 

Information privacy, data privacy, and data protection regulations and laws provide a legal framework about how organizations and individuals can collect, use, and store data about people, companies, or other entities. Laws and regulations rarely define or prescribe specific technologies that you must use to protect data. Rather, you're responsible for selecting appropriate technologies, platforms, or vendors that comply with your legal requirements.

Various laws around the world describe the rights of people and companies to control who's using their data. Privacy laws and regulations generally set forth requirements that must be followed when handling different types of data.

## Considerations for defining compliant procedures

Internal data-handling policies that your organization develops should reflect the requirements in laws and regulations that apply to your organization and the data it's handling. Your internal compliance framework should focus on principles and procedures for data access, use, and protection.

Data-protection officers must understand data-handling requirements based on their country/region’s laws and regulations and their organization’s internal policies. This can help them define procedures for data collection, storage, and protection and technology use.
