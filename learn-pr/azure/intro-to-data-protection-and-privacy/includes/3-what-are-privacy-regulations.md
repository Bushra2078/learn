Various laws around the world describe the rights of people and companies to control who's using their data. Privacy laws and regulations generally set forth requirements that must be followed when handling different types of data.

## Overview of privacy laws and regulations

Many countries, and in some cases regions or specific states, have enacted laws or regulations addressing privacy and the protection of personal data. Examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). More detail about these two privacy laws is provided in the following units.

In general, privacy law and regulations set forth a legal framework about how organizations, and in some cases, individuals, can collect, use, and store personal data. In most cases, laws and regulations do not define or prescribe specific technologies that organizations must use to protect data; rather they leave it up to the organization to identify compliant technologies, operations, and other appropriate data-protection measures.

## Considerations for defining compliant procedures

Internal data-handling policies that your organization develops should be designed to reflect the requirements in laws and regulations that apply to your organization and the data being handled. Your internal compliance framework should focus on principles and procedures for data access, use, and protection.

Data protection officers (DPOs) must understand data-handling requirements based on their state’s/country’s/region’s laws and regulations and their organization’s internal policies. Such understanding can help DPOs define appropriate procedures for data collection, storage, and protection and technology use.
