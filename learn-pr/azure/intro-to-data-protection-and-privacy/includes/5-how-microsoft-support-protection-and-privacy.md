You can use Microsoft 365 to help achieve compliance with the GDPR and other regulations.

## DPO

Microsoft has a designated EU data protection officer (DPO) who is an independent advisor for its engineering and business groups. The DPO helps ensure that all proposed processing of personal data meets EU legal requirements and Microsoft corporate standards. The design of the DPO role meets GDPR criteria mandated in Articles 37-39. The EU DPO reports directly to the Microsoft Chief Privacy Officer, who's a senior executive within the Microsoft Corporate and Legal Affairs division. The DPO role has autonomy to perform functions in an independent, unbiased manner. Through the Chief Privacy Officer's organization, the DPO has access to training and customer-response resources so they can perform their duties.

## Data categorization

Microsoft uses its own data categorization for online services. The categories are:

- Customer data. Customer data is all data that you provide to Microsoft directly or by using Microsoft enterprise online services, excluding Microsoft Professional Services. It includes text, sound, video, image files, and software. It also includes customer data and apps you upload for storage, processing, or distribution through a Microsoft enterprise cloud service. For example, customer content includes Microsoft Exchange Online email and attachments, Power BI reports, SharePoint Online site content, and instant-messaging conversations.

- Diagnostic data. Diagnostic data includes all data that's collected or obtained from software that you locally install to use with Microsoft enterprise online services. Microsoft uses diagnostic data to help ensure that client software is secure and performing correctly. For example, Microsoft collects information about how long it takes to launch an app, add-in failures, and the number of sign-in attempts. Also known as telemetry data, it doesn't include names, email addresses, or file content.

- Service-generated data. Service-generated data includes all data that Microsoft generates or derives through its online services. Microsoft collects this data from its online services and uses it to help ensure performance, security, scaling, and other services that affect customer experiences are working at levels that customers require. For example, to understand how to improve datacenter capacity as a customer's use of Microsoft Teams increases, Microsoft processes log data of their Teams usage. Microsoft then reviews the logs for peak usage times and decides which datacenters to add to meet capacity.

- Professional services data. Professional services data is that which customers provide to Microsoft. It also includes data that Microsoft processes upon authorization and through a customer engagement with Microsoft to obtain professional services. Additionally, it includes data that customers provide to Microsoft during technical support for online services. Examples include text, sound, video, image files, or software provided to Microsoft during troubleshooting.

- Administrator data. Administrator data is information about administrators that's supplied during sign up, purchase, or administration of Microsoft services. It includes names, phone numbers, and email addresses. It also includes aggregated usage information and account data, such as the controls you select. Microsoft uses administrator data to provide services, complete transactions, service the account, and detect and prevent fraud.

- Payment data. Payment data is the information you provide when you buy a Microsoft product online. It might include a credit card number and security code, name, billing address, and other financial information. Microsoft uses payment data to complete transactions and to detect and prevent fraud.

- Personal data. Personal data includes any information that pertains to an identified or identifiable natural person. Microsoft uses the same definition for personal data as the GDPR. Personal data is a subset of administrator and payment data, and each of this list's data categories. It also includes pseudonymized data.

## Microsoft's GDPR commitments to customers

The EU’s GDPR sets a new global bar for privacy rights, information security, and compliance. Microsoft believes that privacy is a fundamental right and the GDPR is crucial for helping protect and enable individuals' privacy rights. Microsoft is committed to complying with the GDPR. It provides an array of products, features, documentation, and resources that support its customers in meeting GDPR compliance obligations.

The GDPR requires that controllers (such as organizations and developers using Microsoft’s enterprise online services) only use processors (such as Microsoft) that:

- Process personal data on the controller’s behalf.

- Provide sufficient guarantees to meet key GDPR requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft has been proactive in providing these commitments to all enterprise online service customers as part of their subscription agreements and to volume-licensing customers as part of their enterprise agreements. Customers of other available enterprise software that Microsoft or its affiliates have licensed also benefit from the Microsoft GDPR commitments to the extent that its software processes personal data.

The Microsoft GDPR terms reflect the commitments that GDPR Article 28 requires of processors, including that they:

- Only uses subprocessors with the controller's consent and remain liable for subprocessors.

- Process personal data only on instructions from the controller, including transfers.

- Ensure that people who process personal data are committed to confidentiality.

- Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that help ensure personal data security.

- Help the controller meet obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests to exercise their GDPR rights.

- Meet the GDPR’s breach notification and assistance requirements.

- Assist the controller with data-protection impact assessments and consultation with supervisory authorities.

- Delete or return personal data when service provisioning ends.

- Support the controller with evidence of GDPR compliance.

## Microsoft and the CCPA

For commercial customers doing business in California, Microsoft is a service provider with respect to its Online Services and Professional Services offering. The Online Services Terms and the Microsoft Professional Services Data Protection Addendum meet the CCPA requirements for Service Providers. Microsoft complies with all laws and regulations that apply to its provision of Online Services. This includes the CCPA. This is sufficient coverage to enable customers to transfer data to Microsoft’s Online Services. No other contractual changes are required for customers who rely on Microsoft as a Service Provider under the CCPA.
