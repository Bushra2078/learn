Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server, while cloud services are under evaluation.

Contosoâ€™s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team has started exploring Azure capabilities, as well Microsoft 365 platform. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization. They are also considering to use Microsoft 365 productivity services instead of locally deployed services, such as e-mail, intranet portal and storage. However, Contoso legal department has serious concerns about data privacy, compliance and data protection, when using cloud services instead of locally deployed services.

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to evaluate data privacy, protection and compliance capabilities of Azure and Microsoft 365 platform. You should make sure that these services have capabilities to address concerns that legal department has.
