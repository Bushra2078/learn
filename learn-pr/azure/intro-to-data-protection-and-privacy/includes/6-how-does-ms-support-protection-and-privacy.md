Microsoft 365 provides a rich set of capabilities to help you achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well with other regulations. 

Microsoft has designated a European Union Data Protection Officer (DPO) to be an independent advisor for Microsoft's engineering and business groups and to help ensure that all proposed processing of personal data meets EU legal requirements and Microsoft's corporate standards. The role was designed to meet the GDPR criteria set out in Articles 37-39. The European Union DPO reports directly to Microsoft's Chief Privacy Officer, a senior executive within Microsoft's Corporate and Legal Affairs division. The DPO role has autonomy to perform the functions in an independent, unbiased manner. Through the Chief Privacy Officer's organization, the DPO has access to training and customer response resources as necessary to perform the DPO functions. The DPO is bound by confidentiality concerning their tasks through the use of a non-disclosure agreement.

Microsoft uses its own data categorization for online services:

- **Customer data** - Customer data is all data, including text, sound, video or image files, and software that you provide to Microsoft or that’s provided on your behalf through your use of Microsoft enterprise online services, excluding Microsoft Professional Services. It includes customer content, which is the data you upload for storage or processing and apps you upload for distribution through a Microsoft enterprise cloud service. For example, customer content includes Exchange Online email and attachments, Power BI reports, SharePoint Online site content, or instant messaging conversations.
- **Diagnostic data** - Diagnostic data includes all data “collected” or “obtained” from software that you locally install for use in connection with the Microsoft enterprise online service. It is used to help Microsoft ensure the client software is secure and performing properly. For example, Microsoft collects information about how long it takes to launch an app, whether an add-in has crashed, and how many times a sign-in has been attempted. Diagnostic data can also be referred to as telemetry data. It does not include names, email addresses, or file content.
- **Service-generated data** - Service-generated data includes all data “generated” or “derived” by Microsoft through the operation of an online service. Microsoft aggregates this data from our online services and uses it to make sure performance, security, scaling, and other services that impact the customer experience are operating at the levels our customers require. For example, to understand how to ramp up data center capacity as a customer's use of Microsoft Teams increases, we process log data of their Teams usage. We then review the logs for peak times and decide which data centers to add to meet this capacity.
- **Professional services data** - Professional Services Data means all data, provided to Microsoft, or processed by Microsoft, upon authorization and through an engagement with Microsoft to obtain Professional Services. Professional Services Data includes support data that is provided to Microsoft during technical support for an online service. For example, include text, sound, video, image files, or software provided to Microsoft during troubleshooting.
- **Administrator data** - Administrator data is information about administrators supplied during signup, purchase, or administration of Microsoft services, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. It also includes aggregated usage information and data associated with your account, such as the controls you select. We use administrator data to provide services, complete transactions, service the account, and detect and prevent fraud.
- **Payment data** - Payment data is the information you provide when you buy something online with Microsoft. It may include a credit card number and security code, name, billing address, and other financial data. We use payment data to complete transactions and to detect and prevent fraud.
- **Personal data** - “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, such as a name, an identification number, location coordinates, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Microsoft uses the same GDPR definition for personal data. It includes pseudonymized data. In addition to being a subset of administrator data and payment data, personal data is a subset of each of the data categories presented above.

### Microsoft's GDPR Commitments to Customers

The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets a new bar globally for privacy rights, information security, and compliance. At Microsoft, we believe privacy is a fundamental right and that the GDPR is an important step forward in protecting and enabling the privacy rights of individuals. Microsoft is committed to its own compliance with the GDPR, as well as to provide an array of products, features, documentation, and resources to support our customers in meeting their compliance obligations under the GDPR. Following is a description of Microsoft’s contractual commitments to its customers concerning personal data collected from enterprise software.

The GDPR requires that controllers (such as organizations and developers using Microsoft’s enterprise online services) only use processors (such as Microsoft) that process personal data on the controller’s behalf and provide sufficient guarantees to meet key requirements of the GDPR. Microsoft has taken the proactive step of providing these commitments to all enterprise online service customers as part of their subscription agreements and to volume licensing customers as part of their enterprise agreements. Customers of other generally available enterprise software licensed by Microsoft or our affiliates also enjoy the benefits of Microsoft’s GDPR commitments, as described in this notice, to the extent the software processes personal data.

Microsoft’s GDPR Terms reflect the commitments required of processors in Article 28 of the GDPR. Article 28 requires that processors commit to:

- only use subprocessors with the consent of the controller and remain liable for subprocessors;
- process personal data only on instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers;
- ensure that persons who process personal data are committed to confidentiality;
- implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of personal data security appropriate to the risk;
- assist the controller in its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests to exercise their GDPR rights;
- meet the GDPR’s breach notification and assistance requirements;
- assist the controller with data protection impact assessments and consultation with supervisory authorities;
- delete or return personal data at the end of provision of services; and
- support the controller with evidence of compliance with the GDPR.

### Microsoft and the CCPA

For commercial customers doing business in California, Microsoft will be acting as a 'service provider' with respect to our Online Services and Professional Services offering. The terms of the Online Services Terms (OST) and the Microsoft Professional Services Data Protection Addendum (MSDPA) already meet the requirements for Service Providers under the CCPA and are generally sufficient to permit customers to continue to transfer data to our Online Services. As such, no additional contractual changes are required for customers to be able to rely on Microsoft as a Service Provider under the CCPA.

As set out in the OST, Microsoft complies with all laws and regulations applicable to its provision of the Online Services, which would include the CCPA.

Microsoft provides compliance offerings to help your organization comply with national, regional, and industry-specific requirements governing the collection and use of data.
