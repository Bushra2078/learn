There are many laws and regulations about data protection worldwide. However, the most common regulations are the GDPR and CCPA. The GDPR is used in the European Union (EU), and the CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in the United States.

## Overview of GDPR

The GDPR introduces rules for organizations that offer goods and services to people in the EU or that collect and analyze data for EU residents, regardless of where those organizations are located. The GDPR gives people the right to manage their personal data that an organization collects.

The GDPR updates and expands on the earlier Data Protection Directive, which was enacted in 1995. The GDPR focuses on the privacy of an individual's data. An individual is classified as an organization's client, customer, employee, or business partner. The GDPR's goal is to strengthen personal data protection for EU citizens, whether they reside in the EU or elsewhere. The regulation establishes expectations and advises on how to achieve them. The GDPR became enforceable in May 2018.

> [!NOTE]
> The GDPR is all about data and how it's used. In the context of GDPR, you can think of data as having a lifecycle that starts when you collect data, continues as you store and use it (processing), and ends when you delete it from your systems.

The GDPR deals with the following types of data:

-  Personal data. If data is linked or linkable to an identifiable individual. the GDPR considers that data personal. Examples of personal data include name, address, date of birth, and IP address. Additionally, the GDPR considers encoded or "pseudonymous" information to be personal data, regardless of how obscure or technical it is, if it's linked to an individual.

- Sensitive personal data. Data that adds details to personal data, such as a person's religion, trade union membership, and ethnic origin. Sensitive personal data also includes biometric data and DNA. Under GDPR, sensitive data has more stringent protection rules than personal data.

### GDPR terms

When learning about GDPR, important terms to know include:

- Consent. The GDPR states that, "The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind." The GDPR hopes to achieve this goal by using consent when processing personal data. Consent is the act of asking customers if they want to receive email messages from your company. It also means that you don't use opt-out check boxes on your website when you want to use data for marketing purposes. You must request explicit consent using a "clear affirmative act". You'll need to also keep records of when consent is given or revoked.

- Data subject rights. The GDPR establishes data subject rights. These mandate that, with respect to personal data, customers, employees, business partners, clients, contractors, students, and suppliers have the right to:
  - Be informed about their data. Inform individuals about your use of their data.
  
  - Have access to their data. Give individuals access to any of their data that you collect. You could do this by supporting account-access opportunities or manually.
  
  - Ask for data rectification. Individuals can request that you correct inaccurate data.
  
  - Ask for data to be deleted. Also known as the "right to erasure," this allows an individual to request deletion of any of their personal data that a company has collected, across all the systems that use or share it.
  
  - Request restricted processing. An individual can ask that you suppress or restrict their data. However, it's only applicable under certain circumstances.
  
  - Have data portability. An individual can ask for their data to be transferred to another company.
  
  - Object. An individual can object to their data being used for various uses, including direct marketing.
  
  - Ask not to be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling. The GDPR has strict rules about using data to profile people and automate decisions based on that profiling.
  
> [!NOTE]
> It's important to know about the GDPR are regulations that help protect EU citizens and how you might be affected by them even if you aren't an EU citizen. If your organization deals with EU citizens and companies, or plans to in the future, you'll be affected. This applies to both citizens living in an EU state and those living elsewhere.

## Overview of CCPA

The CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in the United States. It provides several privacy rights to Californian consumers. Businesses that the CCPA regulates have several obligations to those consumers, including disclosures, GDPR-like consumer data subject rights, an "opt-out" for certain data transfers, and an "opt-in" requirement for minors.

The CCPA only applies to companies that do business in California and that meet one or more of the following conditions:

- Have a gross annual revenue of more than $25 million U.S. dollars (USD).

- Derive more than 50 percent of their annual income from the sale of California consumer personal information.

- Buy, sell, or share the personal information of more than 50,000 California consumers annually.

> [!NOTE]
> The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. However, enforcement by the California Attorney General started on July 1, 2020.

### Enforcement by the California Attorney General

The California Attorney General enforces the CCPA and has power to issue noncompliance fines. The CCPA also provides a private right of action, which is limited to data breaches. Under the private right of action, damages can incur at a rate of $100 USD and $750 USD per incident per consumer. The California Attorney General also can enforce the CCPA in its entirety with the ability to levy a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 USD per violation or $7,500 USD per intentional violation.

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the CCPA's rights afforded to Californians are like the rights the GDPR provides, including disclosure and data subject rights such as access, deletion, and portability. Customers can research already existing GDPR solutions to help them with their CCPA compliance.
