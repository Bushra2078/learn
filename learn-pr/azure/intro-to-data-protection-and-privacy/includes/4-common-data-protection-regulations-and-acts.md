There are many laws and regulations addressing data protection worldwide. However, the two most widely discussed privacy laws are the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). The GDPR is a regulation governing data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). The CCPA is a California state privacy law and the first comprehensive privacy law in the United States.

## Overview of GDPR

The GDPR governs the use and treatment of personal data by organizations that offer goods and services to EU residents or monitor their behavior, regardless of where those organizations are located. The GDPR also gives individuals certain rights to manage their personal data that an organization collects.

The GDPR updates and expands on the earlier Data Protection Directive, which was enacted in 1995. While the GDPR preserves many of the principles established in the Directive, it is a much more ambitious law. Among its most notable changes, the GDPR gives individuals greater control over their personal data and imposes many new obligations on organizations that collect, handle, or analyze personal data. The GDPR also gives national regulators new powers to impose significant fines on organizations that breach the law.

The GDPR focuses on the privacy of an individual's personal data. One of GDPR's goals is to strengthen personal data protections for those residing in the EU. The GDPR sets out data handling requirements and advises on how to achieve them. The GDPR became enforceable in May 2018.

> [!NOTE]
> The GDPR is all about personal data and how it's used. In the context of GDPR, you can think of data as having a lifecycle that starts when you collect data, continues as you store and use it (processing), and ends when you delete it from your systems.

Personal data is defined broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. If data is linked or linkable to an identifiable individual, the GDPR considers that “personal data.” Common examples of personal data include name, address, date of birth, and IP address. Additionally, the GDPR considers “pseudonymous” information to be personal data, regardless of how obscure or technical it is, if it's linked to an individual.

The GDPR introduces additional obligations on “sensitive personal data”, which the GDPR defines as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. 

### GDPR terms

When learning about GDPR, some additional important terms to know include:

- Controller. A controller is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body. A controller, either alone or jointly with others, decides the purposes of, and processing methods for, personal data. These processing purposes and means are determined by Union or Member State law, a controller, or specific criteria for its nomination that's provided by Union or Member State law.

- Processor. A processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of a controller.

- Legal basis for processing.  Under the GDPR, organizations must be able to point to a “legal basis” for processing personal data. The GDPR provides six grounds for processing, including where the processing is necessary to perform a contract, where an individual has consented to the processing of their data, or where the processing is in the organization’s “legitimate interest,” provided that interest is not outweighed by the individual’s rights.

- Data subject rights. The GDPR establishes data subject rights which, in certain circumstances, give individuals certain rights with respect to an organization’s or data controller’s use of their personal data. Data subject rights under GDPR include the right to:

  - Have access to their data. Individuals have a right to know whether an organization is processing their data and, if so, to have access to that data.

  - Ask for data rectification. Individuals can request that a company correct inaccurate data about the individual.

  - Ask for data to be deleted. Also known as the “right to erasure,” this allows an individual to request deletion of their personal data that a company has collected.

  - Request restricted processing. An individual can ask that a company suppress or restrict the processing of their data.

  - Data portability. An individual can ask for their data to be transferred to another company or processing system.

  - Object. An individual can object to their data being used for various uses, including direct marketing.

  - Ask not to be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling. The GDPR has strict rules about using data to profile people and decisions based solely on automated processing.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The GDPR applies more broadly than might be apparent at first glance. Unlike privacy laws in some other jurisdictions, the GDPR is applicable to organizations of all sizes and all industries. The GDPR may also apply to your organization even if it does not have a physical presence in the EU. In order to understand if the GDPR applies to your organization, you should work closely with your legal team.

## Overview of CCPA

The CCPA is a state privacy law in California and is the first comprehensive privacy law in the United States. It provides several privacy rights to Californian consumers, including:

- The right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared;

- The right to delete personal information collected from them (with some exceptions);

- The right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information; and

- The right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights.

Businesses subject to CCPA have several obligations to Californian consumers, including giving consumers certain notices explaining their privacy practices, meeting the data subject rights listed above, providing an “opt-out” for certain data transfers classified as “sales,” and employing an “opt-in” requirement for minors.
The CCPA only applies to companies that do business in California and that meet one or more of the following conditions:

- Have a gross annual revenue of more than 25 million U.S. dollars (USD).

- Derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling California residents' personal information.

- Buy, receive, or sell the personal information of more than 50,000 California consumers annually.

> [!NOTE]
> The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. However, enforcement by the California Attorney General started on July 1, 2020.

## GDPR vs. CCPA

Similarities between GDPR and CCPA include:

- They both mandate transparency and disclosure obligations.

- They both provide individuals with unique rights over how their data is processed.

One significant difference between the GDPR and CCPA is that the CCPA includes the right for consumers to opt-out from the sale of their personal data to third parties. The term sale has a specific meaning under the CCPA, so you should work with your legal team to understand whether or not your organization might be selling data.
