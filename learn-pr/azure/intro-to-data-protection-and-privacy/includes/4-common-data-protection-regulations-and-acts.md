Although there are many laws and regulations for data protection worldwide, the most commonly used regulations are the GDPR and CCPA. The GDPR is commonly used in the European Union (EU) and the CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in the United States of America.

## Overview of GDPR

The GDPR introduces rules for organizations that offer goods and services to people in the EU, or that collect and analyze data for EU residents, irrespective of where those organizations are located. The GDPR gives people the right to manage their personal data that an organization collects.

The GDPR is an EU regulation that updates and expands the earlier Data Protection Directive that was first enacted in 1995. The GDPR is concerned with the privacy of an individual's data. The individual could be a client, customer, employee, or business partner of an organization. The GDPR's goal is to strengthen personal data protection for EU citizens, whether they reside in the EU or elsewhere. The regulation sets out expectations and advises on how to achieve them. When the GDPR became enforceable in May 2018, organizations started having measures in place to satisfy the requirements of the GDPR.

> The GDPR is all about data and how it's used. In the context of GDPR, you can think of data as having a lifecycle. The cycle starts when you collect data, continues as you store and use it (processing), and ends when you completely delete it from your systems.

The GDPR deals with the following types of data:

-  Personal data. If you can link data to an individual and identify them, then the GDPR considers that data personal. Examples of personal data include name, address, date of birth, and IP address. The GDPR considers even encoded information (also known as "pseudonymous" information) to be personal data, regardless of how obscure or technical the data is, if the data can be linked to an individual.

- Sensitive personal data. This is data that adds more details to personal data. Examples include religion, trade union membership, and ethnic origin. Sensitive personal data also includes biometric data and DNA. Under GDPR, sensitive data has more stringent protection rules than personal data.

### GDPR terms

When learning about GDPR, you'll often come across specific terms. It's important to understand these terms, including:

- Consent. The GDPR states that, "The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind." The GDPR hopes to achieve this goal by using consent when processing personal data. Consent could be the simple act of asking your customers if they want to receive email messages from your company. It also means no longer using opt-out check boxes on your website when you want to use data for marketing. You must take explicit consent using a "clear affirmative act". You'll need to also keep records of when a consent is taken or revoked.

- Data subject rights. The GDPR establishes data subject rights, which means that, with respect to their personal data, customers, employees, business partners, clients, contractors, students, and suppliers have the right to:
  - Be informed about their data. You must inform individuals about your use of their data.
  
  - Have access to their data. You must give individuals access to any of their data that you hold. You could do this by using account access or in a manual manner.
  
  - Ask for data rectification. Individuals can ask you to correct inaccurate data.
  
  - Ask for data to be deleted. Also known as the "right to erasure," this right allows an individual to request the deletion of any of their personal data that a company has collected, across all the systems that use it or share it.
  
  - Request restricted processing. An individual can ask that you suppress or restrict their data. However, it's only applicable under certain circumstances.
  
  - Have data portability. An individual can ask for their data to be transferred to another company.
  
  - Object. An individual can object to their data being used for various uses, including direct marketing.
  
  - Ask not to be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling. The GDPR has strict rules about using data to profile people and automate decisions based on that profiling.

> It's important to understand that although the GDPR is a regulation that protects EU citizens, you can be affected by it even if you are not a citizen of EU. If your organization deals with EU citizens and companies, or hopes to in the future, you'll be affected. This applies to both citizens living in an EU state and those living elsewhere.

## Overview of CCPA

The CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in the United States of America. It provides a variety of privacy rights to Californian consumers. Businesses that the CCPA regulates have a number of obligations to those consumers, including disclosures, GDPR-like consumer data subject rights<!--Damir - term studio lists DSR as “data subject request”, so I’ve removed the acronym here-->, an "opt-out" for certain data transfers, and an "opt-in" requirement for minors.
<!--LM: Term Studio lists DSR as an acronym for "data subject request" but in the context section it does list the full term as capitalized (i.e., it's not consistent) and it's mixed in documentation. I recommend the following in accordance with TS: "data subject request (DSR). Please do spell it out with first mention. -->
The CCPA only applies to companies that do business in California and satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

- Have a gross annual revenue of more than $25 million

- Derive more than 50% of their annual income from the sale of California consumer personal information

- Buy, sell, or share the personal information of more than 50,000 California consumers annually

> [!NOTE]

> The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. However, enforcement by the California Attorney General started on July 1, 2020.

### Enforcement by the California Attorney General

The California Attorney General enforces the CCPA and has power to issue non-compliance fines. The CCPA also provides a private right of action, which is limited to data breaches. Under the private right of action, damages can come in between $100 and $750 per incident per consumer. The California Attorney General also can enforce the CCPA in its entirety with the ability to levy a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 per violation or $7,500 per intentional violation.

> Many of the CCPA's rights afforded to Californians are similar to the rights the GDPR provides, including disclosure and data subject rights such as access, deletion, and portability. As such, customers can research already existing GDPR solutions to help them with their CCPA compliance.
