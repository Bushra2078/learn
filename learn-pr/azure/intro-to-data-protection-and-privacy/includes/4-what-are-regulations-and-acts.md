Although there are many laws and regulations for data protection world-wide, some most commonly used regulations are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). While GDPR is commonly used in European Union, CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in United States.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new rules for organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data for EU residents, no matter where you or your enterprise are located. The GDPR gives rights to people to manage personal data collected by an organization.

The GDPR is an EU regulation that updates and expands the earlier Data Protection Directive (DPD) first enacted in 1995. The GDPR is concerned with the privacy of an individual's data, be that individual a client, customer, employee, or business partner. The GDPR's goal is to strengthen personal data protection for EU citizens, whether they reside in the EU or elsewhere. The regulation sets out expectations and advises on how to achieve them. When the GDPR becomes enforceable in late May 2018, organizations must have measures in place that satisfy the requirements of the GDPR.

The GDPR is all about data and how it's used. In the context of GDPR, you can think of data as having a life cycle. The cycle starts when you collect data, continues as you store it and use it (processing), and ends when you completely delete it from your systems.

The GDPR is concerned with the following types of data:

- **Personal data**: If you can link data to an individual and identify them, then that data is considered personal with respect to the GDPR. Examples of personal data include name, address, date of birth, and IP address. The GDPR considers even encoded information (also known as "pseudonymous" information) to be personal data, regardless of how obscure or technical the data is, if the data can be linked to an individual.

- **Sensitive personal data** This is data that adds more details to personal data. Examples include religion, trade union membership, ethnic origin, and so on. Sensitive personal data also includes biometric data and DNA. Under GDPR, sensitive data has more stringent protection rules than personal data.

### GDPR terms

When learning about GDPR, you'll frequently see some specific terms. It's important to understand these terms. These terms include:

**Consent**

The GDPR states: "The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind." The GDPR hopes to achieve this goal by using *consent* when processing personal data. That could be the simple act of asking your customers if they want to receive email messages from your company. It also means no more opt-out check boxes on your website when you want to use data for marketing. You must take explicit consent using a "clear affirmative act". And, you will need to also keep records of when a consent is taken or revoked.

**Data subject rights**

The GDPR establishes data subject rights, which means that, with respect to their personal data, customers, employees, business partners, clients, contractors, students, suppliers, and so forth have the right to:

- **Be informed about their data**: You must inform individuals about your use of their data.

- **Have access to their data**: You must give individuals access to any of their data that you hold (for example, by using account access or in some manual manner).

- **Ask for data rectification**: Individuals can ask you to correct inaccurate data.

- **Ask for data to be deleted**: Also known as the 'right to erasure', this right allows an individual to request that any of their personal data a company has collected is deleted across all systems that use it or share it.

- **Request restricted processing**: An individual can ask that you suppress or restrict their data. However, it is only applicable under certain circumstances.

- **Have data portability**: An individual can ask for their data to be transferred to another company.

- **Object**: An individual can object to their data being used for various uses including direct marketing.

- **Ask not to be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling**: The GDPR has strict rules about using data to profile people and automate decisions based on that profiling.

It is important to understand that although the GDPR is a regulation that protects EU citizens, you can be affected by it even if you are not a citizen of EU. If your company deals with EU citizens and companies, or you hope to in the future, you will be affected. This applies to both citizens living in an EU State and those living elsewhere.

## California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Overview

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is the first comprehensive privacy law in the United States. It provides a variety of privacy rights to California consumers. Businesses regulated by the CCPA are having a number of obligations to those consumers, including disclosures, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-like consumer data subject rights (DSRs), an 'opt-out' for certain data transfers, and an 'opt-in' requirement for minors.

The CCPA only applies to companies doing business in California which satisfy one or more of the following: 

- Have a gross annual revenue of more than $25 million, or 

- Derive more than 50% of their annual income from the sale of California consumer personal information, or 

- Buy, sell or share the personal information of more than 50,000 California consumers annually.

The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. However, enforcement by the California Attorney General (AG) started on July 1, 2020.

The California AG enforces the CCPA and have power to issue non-compliance fines. The CCPA also provides a private right of action which is limited to data breaches. Under the private right of action, damages can come in between $100 and $750 per incident per consumer. The California AG also can enforce the CCPA in its entirety with the ability to levy a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 per violation or $7,500 per intentional violation.

Many of the CCPA's rights afforded to Californians are similar to the rights the GDPR provides, including the disclosure and data subject right (DSR) requests, such as access, deletion, and portability. As such, customer can look to already existing GDPR solutions to help them with their CCPA compliance.

Similarities between GDPR and CCPA, include:

- Transparency/disclosure obligations,
- Consumer rights to access, delete, and receive a copy of data,
- Definition of 'service providers' that is similar to how GDPR defines 'processors' with a similar contractual obligation, and
- Definition of 'businesses' that encompasses the GDPR definition of 'controllers'.

The biggest difference in CCPA is the core requirement to enable an opt-out from sales of data to third parties (with 'sale' broadly defined to include sharing of data for valuable consideration).
