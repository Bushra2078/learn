## Summary

Create a database on Azure SQL to store data for an application, and create a .NET Core console application to query data from the database.

## Learning objectives

1. Create, configure, and populate an Azure SQL Database
1. Develop a .NET Core console application that queries an Azure SQL Database

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Develop and configure an app that queries an Azure SQL Database*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice (from the module proposal):

    *Add your scenario [(Guidance)](id-guidance-scenarios.md)*

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
