In this exercise, you'll upgrade your database to the Business critical tier and explore the offering, including read-replicas and increased performance.

The exercise will use the ostress tool you used in the previous exercise create a workload. You'll then initiate a failover using the Azure PowerShell module in the Azure Cloud Shell, and observe the effect it has on the ostress workload.  

## Basic high availability (with no configuration!) in Azure SQL - Business critical service tier

In order to complete this exercise, you will complete the following steps:

1. Deploy an identical database with Business critical
1. Run the ostress workload  
1. Use PowerShell to initiate a failover  
1. Observe the results in ostress  
1. Connect to a readable secondary

This exercise will guide you through getting ostress configured, and then you'll see how to use both ostress and PowerShell together to initiate and analyze a failover of Azure SQL Database.  

## Deploy an identical database with Business critical

In a previous module of the learning path, you learned how to scale a database using T-SQL. For this exercise, the goal is to upgrade the same database from General purpose to Business critical using the Azure CLI commands in the Azure Cloud Shell. However, since there is a limit between the frequency of failovers, you will deploy the same sample database as Business critical with the name `AdventureWorks-bc`  

1. In the Azure Cloud Shell terminal on the right, run the following PowerShell to configure your environment.  

    ```powershell
    $resourceGroup = "<rgn>Sandbox resource group name</rgn>"
    $database = "AdventureWorks-bc"
    $server = Get-AzureRmSqlServer -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup
    $server = $server.ServerName

    # Specify your default resource group and Azure SQL Database logical server
    az configure --defaults group=$resourceGroup sql-server=$server

    # Confirm the defaults have been set
    az configure --list-defaults
    ```

1. Next, run the following command to create a database on the business critical service tier.  

    ```powershell
    az sql db create --name $database `
    --edition BusinessCritical `
    --family Gen5 `
    --capacity 2 `
    --sample-name AdventureWorksLT `
    --read-scale Enabled `
    --zone-redundant false
    ```

    This will take a few moments to complete, but while it's running to can review some of the parameters used:

    * `family`: This term specifies the hardware generation. To be consistent with the previous exercise, `Gen5` is used.
    * `capacity`: This term is used to specify the number of DTUs or vCores. To be consistent with the previous exercise, `2` vCores are used.
    * `sample-name`: To be consistent with the previous exercise, the `AdventureWorksLT` database sample used.
    * `edition`: This term is a bit misleading, because it is really referring to the service tier, which is not the same as what edition means in the SQL Server box product.  
    * `read-scale`: This is not enabled by default, but there is no additional cost associated with it. By enabling it, you're enabling one of your secondary replicas to be used as a readable secondary.  
    * `zone-redundant`: By default, this is set to false, but you can set it to true if you want a "multi-az" deployment, with no additional cost. You'll learn more about availability zones in the next unit.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This is only available in [certain regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/availability-zones/az-overview#services-support-by-region) and is not yet available in Azure SQL managed instance.  

1. After the database is created, you should see detailed information about the updates in the Azure Cloud Shell output under two main categories (though you'll also see indicators under several other properties):  
    * `currentServiceObjectiveName`: should be `BC_Gen5_2` where `BC` stands for Business critical  
    * `currentSku`:  
        * `name`: should be `BC_Gen5`
        * `tier`: should be `BusinessCritical`  

1. Another way to check the service tier is to navigate to your database in the Azure portal and review the **Overview** tab, locating the **Pricing tier**.  

    > [!TIP]
    > There are many other ways to check this, but another way is through SSMS. If you right-click on your database and select **Properties** > **Configure SLO**, you can also view the changes.  

## Run the ostress workload

Just like in the previous exercise, you will leverage `ostress` to repeatedly query your Azure SQL Database.

1. Open a new Command Prompt window on your local machine. Use `cd` to change directories to where the availability module is in the repository you cloned or downloaded earlier. For example, you might use

    ```cmd
    cd C:\Users\username\mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals\05-Availability
    ```

    If `C:\Users\username\mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals\05-Availability` was the filepath to the folder.

    The ostress workload will essentially connect and runs a simple query 50,000 times.

1. Before running the workload, you will need to update the below ostress script by replacing `serverName` with the name of your Azure SQL Database logical server, and `password` with your password. Note that this command is slightly different because the database name is now `AdventureWorks-bc`.

    ```cmd
    .\ostress.exe -S"serverName.database.windows.net" -Q"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SalesLT.Customer" -U"cloudadmin" -d"AdventureWorks-bc" -P"password" -n1 -r50000
    ```

    If your workload is running properly, you should be seeing the result of the query `847` repeatedly appearing in the Command Prompt.

    If at any time, you want to stop running the ostress workload before it is complete, you can go into the terminal and press `CTRL` + `c`.  

    If at any time, you want to run the workload again, you can run the command again.  

## Initiate a failover and observe the results

1. Configure your windows so that you can see this browser and the Command Prompt in one view.  

1. Next, run the following code in the Azure Cloud Shell terminal. Note this is the same command you used in the previous exercise.

    ```powershell
    # create a failover
    Invoke-AzSqlDatabaseFailover -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
        -ServerName $server `
        -DatabaseName $database
    ```

1. While this cell is running, you should observe any changes that appear in the terminal. You'll notice that while the failover occurs, for some time you cannot access the database. However, the time where you're unavailable is very short. Once you become disconnected, you should be reconnected after approximately 5 seconds! This failover is 6+ times faster that in the General purpose tier.  

    Recall that databases or managed instances in the Business critical service tier essentially have an Always On Availability Group deployed behind the scenes. This means that when you failover, all that happens is a change in pointers in the backend as we redirect you to one of the secondaries. Because of this, it can be very fast, much faster than General purpose.

## Connect to the read-only replica

Since you enabled the `read-scale` parameter, you have the ability to use one of the secondary replicas for read-only workloads. In order to access the read-only replica in applications, you just have to add the following parameter to your connection string for a database:  

```text
ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
```

1. In SSMS, create a new query connection (select **File** > **New** > **Database Engine Query**).  

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-new-db-engine-query.png" alt-text="New database engine query":::  

1. Using the same way you've been connecting to your Azure SQL Database logical server (with SQL Auth), select **Options**.  

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-connect-azure-sql.png" alt-text="Options in SSMS":::  

1. Select **Connection Properties**, and select **Reset All**. Then, under "Connect to database" select **Browse server** and select your **AdventureWorks-bc** database.  

1. Then select **Additional Connection Parameters** and copy and paste the following into the text box. Finally, select **Connect**.  

    ```sql
    ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
    ```  

    With SSMS, you have to specify the server and database to which you want to connect read-only, because there may be multiple databases in a server with different capabilities as far as readable secondaries goes.

1. To test, try the following query on your new database engine query, and observe the results. Is it what you would expect?  

    ```sql
    SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(), 'Updateability')
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-read-only.png" alt-text="Read only response":::

1. You can optionally re-connect and update the Additional Connection Parameters (replace `ReadOnly` with `ReadWrite`), and confirm you are accessing the read-write primary replica. `ReadWrite` is the default, so if you don't select anything, that's what you'll be in.
