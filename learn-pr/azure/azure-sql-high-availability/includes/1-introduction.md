Depending on the SLA, RTO, and RPO your business requires, Azure SQL has the options you need and built-in capabilities. In this module, you will learn how to translate your knowledge of backup/restore, Always On Failover cluster instances, and Always On Availability Groups to the options for business continuity in Azure SQL.

In this module, you'll cover these topics:  

* Backup and restore  
* High availability architectures
* Going further with availability
* Availability and consistency
* Configuring and monitoring availability

## Prerequisites for exercises  

If you intend to complete the exercises (recommended), a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, you do need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

* Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)  
* Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Download the zip file which includes some of the lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.  

If you cannot complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
