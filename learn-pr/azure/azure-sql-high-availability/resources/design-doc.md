# Title

Azure SQL - Achieve high availability
(Azure SQL fundamentals learning path 5/6)

## Role(s)

- Data Engineer
- Solution Architect
- Developer
- Technology manager

## Level

- Intermediate to Advanced

## Product(s)

- Azure SQL Database
- Azure SQL Managed Instance
- Azure VM
- Azure Data Studio
- SSMS
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI

## Prerequisites

- Understand and are experienced in working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server. If you are new to this, you can review the following book by Bob Ward: [Pro SQL Server on Linux.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pro-sql-server/9781484241288/) This book (available online) introduces SQL Server on Linux, but in the process walks through fundamental SQL Server topics
- Familiarity with the general structure of Azure will be helpful, but not required. The [Azure fundamentals learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) will help you understand the fundamentals of Azure at a general level (not data focused).  
- Complete the **Introduction to Azure SQL**, **Azure SQL - Deploy and Configure**, **Azure SQL - Securing your data**, and **Azure SQL - Deliver consistent performance** modules as part of the **Azure SQL Learning Path** (highly recommended but not required).  

## Summary

In this hands-on, scenario-driven module, you'll learn how to translate your existing SQL Server expertise to Azure SQL including Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instance. At the end of the module, you should have a foundational knowledge of what to use when, as well as how to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot availability for SQL Server in Azure. Depending on the SLA your business requires, Azure SQL has the options you need including built-in capabilities. You will learn how to translate your knowledge of backup/restore, Always On failover cluster instances, and Always On availability groups with the options for business continuity in Azure SQL.    

## Learning objectives

After this module, you should be able to:
<br>

- Determine which Azure SQL deployment option and service tier should be used for scenarios that meet the needs of your application.
- Deploy, configure, monitor, and troubleshoot availability scenarios in Azure SQL using both familiar and new tools and techniques.
- Harness the "power of the cloud" including automation and intelligent capabilities of Azure SQL.
- Translate your existing SQL Server expertise to Azure SQL expertise.  

The goal of this module is to train experienced SQL Server professionals.
