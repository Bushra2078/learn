In addition to using built-in templates to create a customized workbook, you can also create custom workbooks from the beginning to produce highly interactive reports that contains, texts, analytic queries, metrics, and parameters.

## Create a custom workbook

You can create a custom workbook by selecting **+Add workbook** on the header bar from the **Workbooks** page in Azure Sentinel. The **New workbook** page opens, which contains a basic analytics query to get you started.

> [!TIP]
> Each workbook that you create is saved as a workbook resource in the Azure Sentinel resource group.

You can start building your workbook by selecting **Edit** on the **New Workbook** page, and then again select the **Edit** option to change the text that appears in the new workbook template.

Each workbook provides a rich set of capabilities for visualizing the security data collected from the connectors. You can design your workbook with the following visualization types and elements:

- Text
- Query
- Parameters
- Links/tabs
- Metric

You can add a new element to your workbook by selecting **+Add** as the following screenshot depicts.

## Text visualizations

You can use text blocks to interpret your security data, section headings, telemetry data, and other information. You need to edit the text using the Markdown markup language, which provides different formatting options for headings, font styles, hyperlinks, and tables.

> [!NOTE]
> Markdown is a markup language that you can use to format text in plain-text documents. For more information on how to format text by using Markdown controls, refer to the markdown guides available online.

After you add the text, you can select the **Preview** tab to preview how your content will appear. Finally, when you complete editing the text, select the **Done Editing** option.

## Query item

You can create a different query from the logs and visualize the data as text, charts, or grids. You can write the query using KQL, and then format the data using various visualizations including:

- Grids (or tables)
- Area charts
- Bar charts
- Line charts
- Pie charts
- Scatter charts
- Time charts
- Tiles

When you create a query, Azure Sentinel adds a new Run Query step to the workbook as the following screenshot depicts:

:::image type="content" source="../media/06-Query-Visualization.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of the Query visualization step, with the Done editing button called out." border="true":::

On the header bar, there are several fields that provide you options to tune the output of the query.

|---|---|
|Run Query|Use this option to test the result of the query.|
|Samples|Microsoft provides sample code that contains sample queries that you can add to the workbook.|
|Data Source|Use this option to specify the data source for the query.|
|Resource type|Use this option select the type of resource.|
|Log Analytics workspace|Use this option if you want to query data against more than one resource.|
|Time Range|USe this option to specify a time range parameter to use in the query.|
|Visualization|Use this option to choose a specific visualization or choose **Set by query** to present the data in a different format.|
|Size|Use this option to choose the size of the visualization element.|
|Color palette|Use this option to choose specific series colors in chart settings.|

On the **Advanced Settings** tab, you can provide additional customization for the settings and the styles of your query step. On the **Advanced Settings** tab, you can modify properties in the following two tabs:

- **Settings** tab. Use this tab to provide values that affect how the step will appear.
- **Style** tab. Use this tab to set the values that affect how this step will appear.

For example, on the **Settings** tab, you can enter the **Chart title**, as the following screenshot depicts.

:::image type="content" source="../media/06-Advanced-Settings.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of the Advanced settings tab, with the chart title, Total number of Security Alerts." border="true":::

You can use the **Style** tab to adjust the margin and padding element in the step. After you are done customizing the settings and styles, remember to save the step by selecting **Done Editing**.

## Chart visualizations

When you create a query to present the security data as charts, you can customize:

- Height
- Width
- Color palette
- Legend
- Titles
- Axis types and series

The following example counts all the security alerts and visualizes them in a pie chart.

```Kusto

SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated \&gt;= ago(180d)
| summarize Count=count() by AlertSeverity
| render piechart
```

In the previous example, the query indicated the visualization type for the data. You can also use the query without including the *render* parameter, and then use the **Visualization** drop-down menu to select one of the offered types of visualizations, as indicated in the following screenshot.

## Grid visualizations

You can use the grid visualization option from the **Visualization** drop-down menu to present data in tables, which provides an enriched UI for the reports. You can then select the **Column Settings** option to specify which column will be displayed in the table and to provide column labels, if necessary.

On the **Edit Column settings** tab, you can select a different column renderer such as, heatmap, bar, and spark area. If you select **Custom formatting**, you can set units, style, and formatting options for number values.

## Parameters

You can use parameters in your interactive workbook to manipulate the results of the query in different ways. When you create a new parameter step in the workbook, a **New Parameter** page opens, where you can provide the name and other inputs required for the parameter.

You can create the following parameter types:

- Text. You can enter arbitrary text.
- Drop-down. You can modify the appearance of a query step to include a drop-down menu, in which you can select a value from a set of values. In this parameter type, you can enter a KQL query or a JSON string to provide the choices for the drop-down list.
- Options group. You can group multiple properties into group.
- Time range picker. You can select from prepopulated time ranges or select a custom range.
- Resource picker. You can select one or more Azure resources.
- You can select one or more Azure subscription resources.
- Resource type. You can select one or more Azure resource type values.
- You can select one or more Azure location values.

You can reference parameter values in other parts of the workbooks either by using bindings or by using value expansions.

On the **New Parameters** page, in the **Previews** section, you can review the variables that will be displayed and used in the query code.

## Links/tabs

You can add a links/tabs step to customize the navigation in the workbook with tabs, lists, paragraphs, or bullet lists. You can provide the following inputs while adding a new links/tabs step:

- **Text before link**. Use this option to display the text before the link is selected.
- **Link text**. Use this option to specify the actual text that is displayed in the link.
- **Text after link**. Use this option to indicate the text that is displayed after the link is selected.
- **Action**. Use this option to specify the action that will be performed when you select the link, such as **Url, Set a parameter value** and **Scroll to a step**.
- **Value**. Use this option to indicate a value for the link.
- **Settings**. Use this option to configure specific settings based on the link type, and support parameters syntax.
- **Context Blade**. Use this option to open a new context blade to the side instead of a full view.
- **Style**. Use this option to select between Link, Button (primary), Button (secondary) style.

You can add a new tab by selecting **TABS** from the **Style** drop-down menu on the header bar.

## Metric steps

You can use metric steps to combine the results of the workbook with metrics from different Azure resources. After you are done making all your custom modifications to your workbook, remember to save the workbook by selecting **Done Editing**.
