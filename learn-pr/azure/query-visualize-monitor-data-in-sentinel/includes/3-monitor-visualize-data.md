Azure Sentinel Logs provide you access to the various logs collected from the security connectors. Azure Sentinel collects these logs from its integrated connectors and stores them in the Azure Log Analytic workspace.

## Log Analytic workspace

The Log Analytic workspace is a repository that stores data and configuration information. You can create queries to filter important information, which you can then use to create analytics rules and detect threats.
For example, you can use Azure Sentinel Logs in Contoso to search data from multiple sources, aggregate large data sets, and perform complex operations to locate potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Explore the Azure Sentinel Logs page

You can search for specific logs on the **Azure Sentinel Logs** page, which you can access from the navigation pane in Azure Sentinel.

The **Logs** page has four main parts:

- The page header contains links to the **Queries**, **Query explorer**, settings and help section.
- The **Tables** pane displays collected data from the logs in tables, each comprising multiple columns.
- The query pane is where you write your own query expressions.
- The query result pane displays the results of your queries.

### Queries

When you select the **Queries** link on the page header, a new window opens, where you can select from some of the predefined sample queries. From the **Queries** drop-down menu, you can filter these queries based on:

- Category
- Resource Type
- Solution
- Topic

You can start predefined queries by selecting **Run**, which will redirect you to the query pane, where you can observe the query structure and the results. To address Contoso's concern about unauthorized users, you can select the predefined query **Unauthorized Users**, as depicted in the following screenshot.

### Query Explorer

You can use the **Query Explorer** link on the page header to access your previously saved queries. You can also access some **Solution Queries** that basically filter the most common queries that you can use to filter the data. From the **Solution Queries** list, you can either run the query or organize the query in the favorites section by selecting the star symbol.

### Tables pane

The **Tables** pane groups logs from different solutions into tables. You can expand the solution group and observe all the logs that are collected. You can also select one of the logs from the tables pane, and then you can either preview the data or add that log to the **Favorites** section.

The following screenshot displays the logs collected in Azure Sentinel solution.

### Queries pane

You can use the **Queries** pane to create queries that retrieve data based on the expression that you provide. The **Queries** pane can help you in writing an accurate query by providing suggestions and automatically filling the expected elements of the query.
You can use the capabilities of the Kusto query language (KQL) to write a query that retrieves data from the logs. The following example illustrates how to use KQL code in your queries to identify deleted virtual machines.

```kusto
AzureActivity
| where OperationName == 'Delete Virtual Machine'
| where ActivityStatus == 'Accepted'
| extend AccountCustomEntity = Caller
| extend IPCustomEntity = CallerIpAddress
```

### Header toolbar

The header toolbar provides additional interaction with the query, as displayed in the following screenshot.

You can save the query from the **Query** pane by selecting **Save**. This opens a new window, where you are prompted to enter the name of the saved query and category. Saved queries appear in the query explorer.
In the **Time Range** field, you can provide a different time to change the time range for which you want to display the results of the query.
You can also create a link for the query and share with other team members by selecting **Copy link to query**. You can also copy the query text.
From the header toolbar in the **Query** pane, you can create either a **New Azure Monitor alert** or a **New Azure Sentinel alert**. If you opt to create a new Azure Sentinel alert, you will be directed to the next steps for creating an analytics rule.
You can export the query into one of the following formats:

- **Export to CSV**. Use this option to export all the columns, both visible and hidden, into a CSV file that you can open with Microsoft Excel.
- **Export to CSV-Displayed Columns**. Use this option to export only those columns that are shown in the results windows of the query.
- **Export to Power BI (M query)**. Use this option to create and download a **PowerBIQuery.txt** file that you can open with Microsoft Power BI application.

You can pin the results of the query into a private or shared dashboard so you can quickly examine the results of the query.
You can use **Format query** on the header toolbar to make the query more readable.

> [!Note]
> You can export or pin the query only if the query expression generates data in the query result section.

### Query results

In the **Query results** pane, you can observe the results of the query. You can also present the results using a chart, or hide and show additional columns to filter the query results.
