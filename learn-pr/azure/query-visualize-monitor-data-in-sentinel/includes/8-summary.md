The Contoso SecOps team had recently faced issues when users with compromised accounts had tried to access Contoso's customer data. Azure Sentinel provides several monitoring and reporting features that will help alert Contoso about potential security threats.

The SecOps team can use these techniques to gain more insights into their data during their investigations.
