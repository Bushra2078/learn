Microsoft Azure Sentinel Workbook provides an interactive report that visualize important signals, by combining, text, table, charts, tiles. 

## Module scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a New York branch office. Contoso uses several Microsoft products and services to implement data security and threat protection for its resources. These products are:

- Microsoft 365
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Azure AD Identity Protection
- Cloud App Security
- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- System Center Endpoint Protection
- Microsoft Azure Information Protection

Contoso provides threat protection for its Azure-based and on-premises resources by using the paid version of Azure Defender. The company also monitors and protects other non-Microsoft assets.
A recent incident with compromised identities led to exposed customer data. The Contoso Security Operations (SecOps) team wants to ensure that proper monitoring and reporting methods are in place. You need to demonstrate the Azure Sentinel reporting and monitoring capabilities, and how they can alert your organization to potential security incidents.
