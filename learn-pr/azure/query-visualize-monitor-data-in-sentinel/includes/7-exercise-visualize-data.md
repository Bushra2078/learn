**Exercise**

**Task 1: Work with Logs in Azure Sentinel**

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select Azure Sentinel and select the previously created Sentinel workspace.
2. In the **Azure Sentinel** page, on the left side in the menu bar, in the **General** section, select **Logs.**
3. In the **Azure Sentinel | Logs** page in the **Tables** pane, from the **Group by: Solution** drop-down menu, select **Category.**

> [!Note]

> When you open the **Logs** page for the first time, you may be redirected in the **Queries** window. Close the **Queries** windows and return in the **New Query 1** section.

4. In the **Tables** list, expand **Azure Resources** category, and move the mouse over **Azure Activity** table, and then select **Preview data.**
5. In the **AzureActivity** window select **See in query editor.** This can be useful to ensure that this is the data that you&#39;re expecting before you actually run a query with it.

6. In the Query section, you can observe the query structure. This query will search and present the last 10 events from the Azure Activity log. The first raw in the query, **AzureActivity** specify the table used in the query. The second line contains a **where** statement, which filters the records from the last day. The third contains another statement **where,** to filter only the last 10 events.
7. The query results section present the results of the query. You can expand any of the records, to view the values from the table. Click on the name of any column to sort the results by that column. Click on the filter icon next to it to provide a filter condition. This is similar to adding a filter condition to the query itself except that this filter is cleared if the query is run again. If you select **Columns** drop-down menu, you can filter which column from the table to be presented. By selecting **Group columns** , you can group records by a particular column.

5. Click on  **Queries**  in the left pane. This pane includes example queries that you can add to the query window. If you&#39;re using your own workspace, you should have a variety of queries in multiple categories, but if you&#39;re using the demo environment, you may only see a single  **Log Analytics workspaces**  category.

> [!Note]

> You can try to practice writing queries in the following [Demo environment](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring_Logs/DemoLogsBlade).

**Task 2: Work with Workbooks in Azure Sentinel**
