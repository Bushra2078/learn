## 1st unit: Introduction

**Type of unit:** Introduction unit

**Estimated unit duration:** 3 mins

### Module scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Contoso has moved aggressively to Azure services, and it currently uses Microsoft 365 and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It also uses Azure AD Identity Protection, Cloud App Security, Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP), Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP), Microsoft Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, Endpoint Protection, and Microsoft Azure Information Protection. Contoso is also using the paid version of Azure Security Center for threat protection for resources that are running on Azure and on-premises. Additionally, Contoso has other non-Microsoft assets to monitor and protect.
Contoso security team wants to ensure that proper reporting and monitoring are in place. A recent incident with compromised identities led to exposed customer data. You need to demonstrate the reporting and monitoring capabilities in Azure Sentinel, and show how it can alert your organization to perceived security events.

### Resolution of module problem

Contoso security team can use Azure Sentinel Workbooks to provide interactive reports that can display graphs, chart and tables. By using Azure Sentinel workbooks, they can visualize their security data with advanced filtering. They can use these techniques to interacts with their data and get more insights in the process of investigations.
In this module you&#39;ve learned about different elements of a workbook, how to tune and visualize your data. You also learned how to define parameters using a new step, and how to use those parameters to further filter your queries. Using parameters, the workbooks can tune what information to present, to help determine whether there is an incident that needs to be investigated.
