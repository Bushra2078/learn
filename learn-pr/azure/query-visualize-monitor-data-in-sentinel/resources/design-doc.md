## Learner level

- **Beginner**: Introductory and overview material that assumes little or no topic expertise. Covers topic concepts, functions, features, and benefits.

## Products taught

- Microsoft Azure Sentinel
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)<!-- Kusto is now a failed term, and has been replaced with "Azure Data Explorer." Please s/r. -->
- Azure Sentinel workbooks<!-- This term isn't in Term Studio or MS Cloud Style Guide. When I search the internet, it shows up with both "workbooks" and "Workbooks," but the majority are capitalized "Azure Sentinel Workbooks." Currently, capitalization varies throughout this doc. Since the majority are currently lowercase, I've changed them all to lowercase. If you decide to change it to title caps, please search & replace (s/r) -->

## First unit: Introduction

**Type of unit:** Introduction unit

**Estimated unit duration:** 3 minutes

### Module scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Contoso has moved aggressively to Azure services, and it currently uses Microsoft 365 and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It also uses Azure AD Identity Protection, Cloud App Security, Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP), Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, Endpoint Protection, and Microsoft Azure Information Protection. Contoso is also using the paid version of Azure Security Center for threat protection for resources that are running on Azure and on-premises. Additionally, Contoso has other non-Microsoft assets to monitor and protect.

A recent incident with compromised identities led to exposed customer data. The Contoso Security Operations (SecOps) team wants to ensure that proper monitoring and reporting methods are in place. You need to demonstrate the Azure Sentinel reporting and monitoring capabilities, and how they can alert your organization to potential security incidents.

## 7th unit: Summary

**Type of unit:** Summary unit

**Estimated unit duration:** 2 minutes

### Resolution of module problem

Contoso SecOps can now use Azure Sentinel Workbooks to provide interactive reports with graphs, charts, and tables, and to visualize their security data using advanced filtering. They can use these techniques to gain more insights into their data during their investigations.

In this module, you learned about different workbook elements, and how to tune and visualize your data. You also learned how to define parameters using a new step, and then use those parameters to further filter your queries. <!-- We didn't have one of these sentences in Module 6. Can we make them consistent and either delete this "In this module, you've learned" pgph, or add one to Mod 6? -->
