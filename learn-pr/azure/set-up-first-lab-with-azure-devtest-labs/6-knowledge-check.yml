  questions:
  - content: "Eve needs to debug an application problem on Jim's developer VM. What is the right approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "Eve selects the Azure DevTest Labs resource in the Azure portal, and then connects to Jim's lab VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. To connect to a lab VM, you first need to claim the VM. Only one person can claim a lab VM at a time. Because Jim already owns the lab VM, Eve can't connect to it."
    - content: "Eve selects the Azure DevTest Labs resource in the Azure portal, and then claims a new lab VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Although each lab VM originates from the same base image, it's a separate VM instance and shares no runtime state with other VMs."
    - content: "Jim first unclaims the developer VM, after which Eve can then claim the same VM."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Only one person can connect to a VM at a time. Jim needs to first unclaim the VM to allow Eve to connect to it for debugging the application."
  - content: "The eCommerce company has a Node.js and Python development team. They use Linux VMs for their development activities. What is the best approach for configuring Azure DevTest Labs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure DevTest Labs resource, and then create a pool of lab VMs for each team."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An Azure DevTest Labs resource can contain multiple lab VMs with multiple VM instances. Each pool of lab VMs can be pre-configured with artifacts according to the specific needs of the team."
    - content: "Create an Azure DevTest Labs resource for each developer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. An Azure DevTest Labs resource doesn't contain any compute resources. The lab only specifies the configuration and policies for compute resources."
    - content: "Create an Azure DevTest Labs resource, and then create an environment for each team."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Environments in Azure DevTest Labs enable you to create ARM-based compute resources, such as PaaS services. The developers need a VM for their development activities."
  - content: "Resources in Azure are hosted in an Azure region. The location of a lab VM is configured when:"
    choices:
    - content: "Adding a lab VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. When adding a VM to an Azure DevTest Labs resource, you can't configure the location of the VM."
    - content: "Claiming a VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. When claiming an existing lab VM, you can't configure the location of the VM."
    - content: "Creating a DevTest Labs resource."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The location of the Azure DevTest Labs resource determines the location of all VMs created in the lab."
