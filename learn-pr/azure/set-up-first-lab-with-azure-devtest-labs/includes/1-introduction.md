Organizations often have many different, sometimes short-lived, software environments. 
For example, developers need a virtual machine with all developer tools installed, the test team uses a clean test setup with each application build, and customer support requires a separate machine for each supported production version.
Azure DevTest Labs lets you simplify and accelerate the process of creating, using and managing virtual machines and platform-as-a-service environments.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at an eCommerce company that offers fashion and lifestyle products to consumers. Your company operates in a highly competitive market where you need to innovate rapidly to keep your customer engagement high.

As the development team expands rapidly, you want to give developers a self-service experience to provision their developer machines. The IT organization wants to standardize to keep the managed cost low.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll configure a standardized development lab and pre-configure it with software components. You'll use this lab to create a development virtual machine. You can then access this development VM by using Remote Desktop software.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create development labs by using Azure DevTest Labs, each configured with a specific operating system and required software components.
