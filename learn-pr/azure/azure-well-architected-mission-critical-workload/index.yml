title: Challenge Project - Build a booking requests app with Power Apps and Power Automate
summary: You want to design a highly reliable, available, and resilient workload that uses Azure capabilities to apply tighter network security controls. The architecture is for an example workload for a fictious company. You'll be given the high-level specifications, design principles, example solutions to complete the project.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll demostrate your ability to:
   - Define key strategies for restricting network access
   - Identify Azure networking services needed for multi-region deployment
   - Define a network layout for the workload with network controls in place
prerequisites: |
  - Experience designing a workload that includes core infrastructure technology such as data storage, compute, and networking
  - Experience designing a workload that's deployed to multiple regions
  - Good understanding of the design principles and design areas of a mission-critical workload provided in the Azure Well-Architected Framework
