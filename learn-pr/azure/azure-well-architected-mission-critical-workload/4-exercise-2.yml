  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: 'Which service is appropriate for global routing in this architecture?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Azure Application Gateway'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure Application Gateway is a regional load balancer.'
    - content: 'Azure Front Door'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Front Door provides global load balancing and site acceleration for web applications. This is a good choice for workloads with high-availability requirements. It offers fast failover, caching, and is integrated with Web Application Firewall (WAF).'
    - content: 'Azure Traffic Manager'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that distributes traffic across global Azure regions. However, it doesn't have the capabilities required by this architecture. For example, Web Application Firewall and the ability to fail over quickly.'
  - content: 'Which of the following is a good example of using automation to improve operational excellence?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Manually provisioning development environments every day for your development teams.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This is an excellent opportunity to provide automated deployments that your development team can use for self-service.'
    - content: 'Logging on Linux VMs after deployment and installing the software packages that are required for the application.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Post-deployment configuration should be included in an automated build process to reduce error and variance.'
    - content: 'Using a configuration template to deploy infrastructure in each environment.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'By using a configuration template to deploy infrastructure, you can be sure to have consistent, repeatable environments.'
    - content: 'Manually copying application binaries from your build system to your deployment infrastructure.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Automation would reduce the risk of errors that occur when manual steps are performed.'
