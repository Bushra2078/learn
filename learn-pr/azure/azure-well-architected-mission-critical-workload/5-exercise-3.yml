quiz:
  title: Check your design
  questions:
  - content: 'What needs to be included in your overall score that represents the overall health status of the application?'

    - content: 'Logs and metrics from Azure services.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Health of Azure services that participate in a request flow can have an impact on the application. Compute, databases, storage are some of the key components that must be considered.'
