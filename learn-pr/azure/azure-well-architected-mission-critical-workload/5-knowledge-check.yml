  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following is an example of scaling up (vertical scaling)?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Updating your application to use a queuing service'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Including a queuing service in your application can be a smart architectural decision, but is not an example of vertical scaling.'
    - content: 'Adding more web servers into a web farm'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Adding more web servers into a web farm is an example of scaling out (horizontal scaling).'
    - content: 'Adding another virtual machine into a database cluster'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Adding another virtual machine into a database cluster is not an example of vertical scaling.'
    - content: 'Updating a virtual machine to a larger size'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Changing a virtual machine to a larger size increases the resources available to the instance, and is an example of scaling up (vertical scaling).'
  - content: 'Which of the following is an example of scaling out (horizontal scaling)?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Updating a virtual machine to a larger size'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Changing a virtual machine to a larger size increases the resources available to the instance, and is an example of scaling up (vertical scaling).'
    - content: 'Adding more storage to a virtual machine'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Adding more storage to a virtual machine is not an example of horizontal scaling.'
    - content: 'Adding more web servers into a web farm'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Adding more web servers into a web farm is an example of scaling out (horizontal scaling).'
    - content: 'Replicating backups to another region'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Replicating backups to another region is not applicable to scaling of resources.'
