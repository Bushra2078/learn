Next steps:

1. Scale unit architecture
1. Ephemeral dev environments
1. Zero-down time deployment process
1. Continuous validation

## Ephemeral dev environments
Dev env so any shared access will blow. Int his architecture that was ACR. 
Dev env needs to be independent of other dev env. Dev 1 and Dev 2 should use their env.They shouldn't share with Prod. Trade off on costs.
