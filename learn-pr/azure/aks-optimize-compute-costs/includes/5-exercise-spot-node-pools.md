In the previous exercise, you created a standard user node pool, used the cluster autoscaler to manage the creation of nodes, and scaled the node count manually. Here, you'll add a spot user node pool with automatic scaling to reduce your cluster's operational costs where usage still varies but isn't as predictable. You'll also deploy a workload with node affinity enabled so that the pod is scheduled on nodes in the spot node pool.

## Enable preview features on your subscription

1. Sign in to Azure Cloud Shell with your Azure account. Select the Bash version of Cloud Shell.

    >[!div class="nextstepaction"]
    >[Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/?azure-portal=true)

    >[!CAUTION]
    >
    >This exercise uses preview features. After you enable some preview features in Azure, defaults might be used for all Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters created in the subscription. Test any preview features in non-production subscriptions to avoid unforeseen side effects in production deployments.

1. Register the **spotpoolpreview** flag by using the `az feature register` command. This command takes two parameters: *namespace* identifies the resource provider you're registering the feature with, and *name* identifies the feature.

    ```azurecli
    az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "spotpoolpreview"
    ```

1. Check that the registration is successful by querying the feature list table. Use the `az feature list` command to run the query. The feature's registration can take several minutes to finish, so you'll have to check the result periodically.

    ```azurecli
    az feature list -o table --query "[?contains(name, 'Microsoft.ContainerService/spotpoolpreview')].{Name:name,State:properties.state}"
    ```

1. When the feature registration is complete, run the `az provider register` command with the `--namespace` parameter to update the registration:

    ```azurecli
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
    ```

## Install the Azure CLI preview extensions

1. To work with this preview, you must use the aks-preview Azure CLI preview extension for AKS. Install version 0.4.0 of the Azure CLI preview extension by running the `az extension add` command:

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name aks-preview
    ```

    You can check the installed version of the extension if you've already installed the preview version. Run the `az extension show` command to query the extension version:

    ```azurecli
    az extension show --name aks-preview --query [version]
    ```

    You can update the extension by running the `az extension update` command if you've previously installed the extension and need to update it to a newer version:

    ```azurecli
    az extension update --name aks-preview
    ```

## Create a spot node pool

You want to create a separate node pool that supports the batch-processing service. This node pool is a spot node pool that uses the Delete eviction policy and a spot maximum price of -1.

1. Run the same `az aks nodepool add` command as in the previous exercise to add a new spot node pool to your cluster. You'll need to change the node pool name and add a few more parameters to identify this node pool as a spot node pool.

    Use the following values to set the node pool's parameters:

    - Name: `batchprocpl2`
    - Priority: `Spot`
    - Eviction policy: `Delete`
    - Spot maximum price: `-1`

    Run the following command to create the spot node pool:

    ```azurecli
    az aks nodepool add \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
        --name batchprocpl2 \
        --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
        --max-count 3 \
        --min-count 1 \
        --priority Spot \
        --eviction-policy Delete \
        --spot-max-price -1 \
        --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \
        --no-wait
    ```

    Keep in mind that this request might fail because of capacity restrictions in the location that you've selected.

1. Run the `az aks nodepool show` command to show the details of the new spot node pool for the batch-processing service:

    ```azurecli
    az aks nodepool show \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
        --name batchprocpl2
    ```

    Here's an example of the output from the command.

    ```output
    {
    "agentPoolType": "VirtualMachineScaleSets",
    "availabilityZones": null,
    "count": 3,
    "enableAutoScaling": true,
    "enableNodePublicIp": false,
    "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/rg-akscostsaving/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/akscostsaving-17835/agentPools/batchprocpl2",
    "maxCount": 3,
    "maxPods": 110,
    "minCount": 1,
    "mode": "User",
    "name": "batchprocpl2",
    "nodeImageVersion": "AKSUbuntu-1604-2020.06.10",
    "nodeLabels": {
        "kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority": "spot"
    },
    "nodeTaints": [
        "kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority=spot:NoSchedule"
    ],
    "orchestratorVersion": "1.17.9",
    "osDiskSizeGb": 128,
    "osType": "Linux",
    "provisioningState": "Creating",
    "proximityPlacementGroupId": null,
    "resourceGroup": "akscostsavinggrp",
    "scaleSetEvictionPolicy": "Delete",
    "scaleSetPriority": "Spot",
    "spotMaxPrice": -1.0,
    "tags": null,
    "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools",
    "upgradeSettings": {
        "maxSurge": null
    },
    "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2",
    "vnetSubnetId": null
    }
    ```

    A few values in this result are distinctly different from what you've seen in previous node pools. Let's review these items:

    - The `enableAutoScaling` property value is set to `true`.

    - Both the `maxCount` and `minCount` values are set.

    - The `scaleSetEvictionPolicy` property is set to `Delete`.

    - The `scaleSetPriority` property is set to `Spot`.

    - The `spotMaxPrice` property is set to `-1`.

    - The `nodeLabels` and `nodeTaints` are applied to this node pool. You use these values to schedule workloads on the nodes in the node pool.

## Configure a namespace

1. Use the `kubectl create namespace` command to create a namespace called `costsavings` for the application. You'll use this namespace to make it easier to select your workloads.

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace costsavings
    ```

    You'll see a confirmation that the namespace was created:

    ```output
    namespace/costsavings created
    ```

## Schedule a pod with spot node affinity

You can schedule a pod to run on a spot node by adding toleration to the pod's deployment manifest file. When the toleration corresponds with the taint applied to your spot nodes, the pod is scheduled on these nodes.

The nodes in a spot node pool are assigned a taint that equals `kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority=spot:NoSchedule`. Use the information in this key-value pair in the `tolerations` section of your workloads YAML manifest file. With the second batch-processing pool configured as a spot node pool, you can now create a deployment file to schedule workloads to run on it.

1. Create a manifest file for the Kubernetes deployment called `spot-node-deployment.yaml` by using the integrated editor:

    ```bash
    code spot-node-deployment.yaml
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > Cloud Shell includes an [integrated file editor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/using-cloud-shell-editor). The Cloud Shell editor supports features such as language highlighting, the command palette, and a file explorer. For simple file creation and editing, start the editor by running `code .` in the Cloud Shell terminal. This action opens the editor with your active working directory set in the terminal. To open your manifest file directly for quick editing, run `code spot-node-deployment.yaml`. This command opens the editor without the file explorer.

1. Paste the following text into the file:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        env: test
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      tolerations:
      - key: "kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "spot"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    ```

1. Select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to save the file. Select <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to close the editor.

1. Use the `kubectl apply` command to apply the configuration and deploy the application in the `costsavings` namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply \
    --namespace costsavings \
    -f spot-node-deployment.yaml
    ```

    You'll see output like this example:

    ```output
    pod/nginx created
    ```

1. You can fetch more information about the running pod by using the `-o wide` flag with the `kubectl get pods` command. In this case, you want to see which node the pod is scheduled on. Make sure to query for pods in the `costsavings` namespace.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace costsavings -o wide
    ```

    You'll see output like this example:

    ```output
    NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE                                   NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
    nginx   1/1     Running   0          43s   10.244.3.3   aks-batchprocpl2-25254417-vmss000000   <none>           <none>
    ```

    Notice the name of the node, `aks-batchprocpl2-25254417-vmss000000`. This node is part of the `batchprocpl2` spot node pool that you created earlier.
