  title: Configure multiple nodes and enable scale to zero using Azure Kubernetes Service
  description: You can configure multiple node pools on AKS to run specific workloads. Node pools make use of virtual scale sets that allow you to set the number of nodes in a node pool. You can set the node count in a node pool to zero to optimize your cluster's running costs when nodes are not used in a node pool. Here you'll explore how to configure a node pool to scale its node count to zero.
