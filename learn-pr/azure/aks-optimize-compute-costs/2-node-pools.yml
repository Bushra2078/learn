  title: How to configure multiple nodes and enable scale-to-zero by using AKS
  description: You can configure multiple node pools on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to run specific workloads. Node pools use virtual scale sets that allow you to set the number of nodes in a node pool. You can set the node count in a node pool to zero to optimize your cluster's running costs when nodes aren't used in a node pool. Here you'll explore how to configure a node pool to scale its node count to zero.

  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Suppose you have a software solution with three critical components. The first component is a web application, the second is a service that process online orders, and the third is video rendering and analysis service that is run add-hoc and requires GPU-based VMs. How many node pools would you deploy in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to manage the solution to optimize cost?"

    choices:
    - content: "Deploy a single node pool when you create the AKS cluster. Assign three nodes per component by using GPU-based VMs, for a total of nine nodes in the node pool. Enable autoscaling on the node pool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A single node pool doesn't give you enough flexibility to scale different workloads in a cost-effective way."
    - content: "Deploy three node pools on the AKS cluster. Create the first and second node pools with standard-sized virtual machines (VMs), and create the third node pool with specialized, GPU-based VMs. Enable the cluster autoscaler on all three node pools."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An AKS cluster with three node pools does give you flexibility to scale the node count in each pool independently. However, you can't scale a node pool to zero after you enable the autoscaler. Use of the GPU-based node pool won't be cost effective for workloads that run only as needed."
    - content: "Deploy three node pools on the AKS cluster. Create the first and second node pools with standard-sized VMs and the third node pool with specialized, GPU-based VMs. Enabled autoscaling on the first two node pools. Scale the GPU-based node pool manually."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An AKS cluster with three node pools gives you flexibility to scale the node count in each pool independently for each component in the solution. Because you didn't enable the autoscaler on the GPU-based node pool, that pool's node count can be scaled to zero to optimize compute costs."

  - content: "Complete the following statement. The Kubernetes cluster autoscaler scales ..."
    choices:
    - content: "... the number of workload replicas on an AKS cluster. It monitors the Metrics API every 30 seconds to decide whether your application needs additional instances to meet demand."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The horizontal pod autoscaler is responsible for scaling the number of workload replicas on an AKS cluster."
    - content: "... the number of nodes by monitoring the Metrics API. It scales the number of nodes up or down based on computing resources required."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Kubernetes cluster autoscaler scales the number of nodes up or down based on computing resources required."
    - content: "... the number of node pools on an AKS cluster. It monitors the Metrics API every 30 seconds to decide whether your application needs additional node pools to meet demand."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The decision to add node pools to an AKS cluster is the responsibility of the cluster operator."
