title: Optimize compute costs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
summary: Explore cost optimization strategies to use on Azure for your cloud-native application development process by using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). AKS offers features such as node auto scaling, AKS spot node pools, and Azure Policy that allows you to manage compute costs on your AKS cluster.
