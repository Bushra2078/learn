## Azure Resource Graph

Azure Resource Graph is an Azure service designed to extend Azure Resource Management by providing efficient and performant resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across a given set of subscriptions so that you can effectively govern your environment. With Azure Resource Graph, you can access the properties returned by resource providers without needing to make individual calls to each resource provider.

These queries provide the following abilities:

- Query resources with complex filtering, grouping, and sorting by resource properties.
- Explore resources iteratively based on governance requirements.
- Assess the impact of applying policies in a vast cloud environment.
- Query changes made to resource properties (preview).

Azure Resource Graph supports a subset of KQL data types, scalar functions, scalar operators, and aggregation functions. Specific tabular operators are supported by Resource Graph, some of which have different behaviors. This behavior is summarized in [Supported KQL language elements](/azure/governance/resource-graph/concepts/query-language#supported-kql-language-elements).

## Microsoft 365 Defender

Microsoft 365 Defender is a unified pre- and post-breach enterprise defense suite that natively coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and applications to provide integrated protection against sophisticated attacks. While your security operations team receives an alert within the Microsoft 365 Defender portal whenever a malicious or suspicious activity or artifact is detected, it's not enough to respond to attacks as they occur. For extended, multi-phase attacks such as ransomware, you must proactively search for the evidence of an attack in progress and take action to stop it before it completes.

Advanced hunting is a query-based threat hunting tool that lets you explore up to 30 days of raw data. You can proactively inspect events in your network to locate threat indicators and entities. The flexible access to data enables unconstrained hunting for both known and potential threats.
