## Azure Resource Graph

Azure Resource Graph is an Azure service designed to extend Azure Resource Management by providing efficient and performant resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across a given set of subscriptions so that you can effectively govern your environment. With Azure Resource Graph, you can access the properties returned by resource providers without needing to make individual calls to each resource provider.

These queries provide the following abilities:

- Query resources with complex filtering, grouping, and sorting by resource properties.
- Explore resources iteratively based on governance requirements.
- Assess the impact of applying policies in a vast cloud environment.
- Query changes made to resource properties (preview).

Azure Resource Graph supports a subset of KQL data types, scalar functions, scalar operators, and aggregation functions. Specific tabular operators are supported by Resource Graph, some of which have different behaviors. This behavior is summarized in [Supported KQL language elements](/azure/governance/resource-graph/concepts/query-language#supported-kql-language-elements).
