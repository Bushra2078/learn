In this unit, you'll explore the structure of a KQL query.



How a KQL query is structured 

Funnel of data processing 

Input, transform, output 

Types of KQL queries 

Functions (built-in, query-defined, stored) 

Management commands 




Read only query language 

Optimized for time series (is this true of KQL or just ADX?) 

Structured, unstructured, semi-structured data 

Used to explore, analyze, and transform data 

Built-in advanced data analysis capabilities 

Compare with SQL/splunk 

"Kusto Query Language is an expressive, intuitive, and highly productive query language. It offers a smooth transition from simple one-liners to complex data processing scripts, and supports querying structured, semi-structured, and unstructured (text search) data. There is a wide variety of query language operators and functions (aggregation, filtering, time series functions, geospatial functions, joins, unions, and more) in the language. KQL supports cross-cluster and cross-database queries, and is feature rich from a parsing (json, XML etc.) perspective. In addition, the language natively supports advanced analytics."
