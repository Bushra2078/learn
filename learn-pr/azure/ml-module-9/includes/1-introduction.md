Machine learning models are computer algorithms that use data to make estimations (educated guesses) or decisions. Machine learning models differ from traditional algorithms in how they are designed. When normal computer software needs to be improved, people edit it. By contrast, **a machine learning algorithm uses data to get better at a specific task**.

For example, spam filters use machine learning. Twenty years ago, spam filters did not have many examples to learn from and were not good at identifying what is and isn’t spam. As more spam has arrived and been labelled as junk by human users, the machine learning algorithms have gained more experience and become better at their job.

## Scenario: Avalanche-Rescue Dogs Need Boots That Fit

Throughout this module, we’ll be using an example scenario to explain key machine learning concepts.

In this scenario, you own a shop which sells harnesses for avalanche-rescue dogs, and you’ve recently expanded to also sell doggy boots. Customers all seem to pick the correct harness sizes but are constantly ordering doggy boots that are the wrong size. You know most customers buy harnesses and boots in the same transaction, which gives you an idea: perhaps you could approximate which doggy boots are the correct size, depending on the harness chosen. Then, you could warn customers if the boots they have selected are likely to be the correct size before they make the purchase.

During this module, we’ll create a machine learning model that does exactly this. Along the way, we’ll use this scenario to introduce you to some basic machine learning concepts and demonstrate how to use them in a practical setting.
