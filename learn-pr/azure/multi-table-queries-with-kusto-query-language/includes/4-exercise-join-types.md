In this exercise, you'll learn how to use the `join` operator. Recall that the `join` operator merges the rows of two tables by matching values of the specified columns from each table. You'll use the results of the `join` operator to answer questions about sales.

## Use the `join` operator

In the retail company scenario, your team starts by asking you for the three countries that have the most sales.

You start by inspecting the *SalesFact* table and see that the figures you need are available in the `SalesAmount` column, but the table doesn't contain any country data. Examining the other tables, you notice that the country data is available in the `RegionCountryName` column in the *Customers* table. You also notice that both tables have a **CustomerKey** column.

Since the data is spread over two tables, you'll need to get data from the customer data, and the sales data to be able to write a query that provides the requested information. You can use the `join` operator to do this, using the **CustomerKey** to match rows from both tables.

Now you're ready to write the query. You'll use an inner join to get all matching rows from both tables. For best performance, you'll use the customers dimension table as the left table and the sales fact table as the right table.

In the following steps, you'll build the query in stages so that you get a better understanding the result of using the `join` operator.

1. Run the following query to get 10 matching arbitrary rows from the *Customers* table and the *SalesFact* table.

    ```kusto
    Customers
    | join kind=inner SalesFact on CustomerKey
    | take 10
    ```

    Take a look at the resulting list. Notice that the resulting table contains columns from the *Customers* table followed by matching columns from the *SalesFact* table.

1. Run the following query to summarize the joined tables to get the three countries that have the most sales.

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/ContosoSales?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAA02MsQ7CMAxEdyT+4cZ2Zu6AIrEgMQA/4FILBWobOckQxMfTAAPTSe/dXSgpm7Cn9eqFm0XFPeo0RFV2nGjmtKNLhinCr7nn2rqpiJDHJ+NsmeatWNGMAb7k1C22+6y/vO8xVhz5Gk1DA14PJNx+sj2wafbv5g1dXsYVlQAAAA==" target="_blank">Click to run query</a>

    ```kusto
    Customers
    | join kind=inner SalesFact on CustomerKey
    | summarize TotalAmount = round(sum(SalesAmount)) by RegionCountryName
    | top 3 by TotalAmount
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

1. Take a look at the resulting list. Try modifying the query to also show the corresponding total cost and profit for these countries.

You're then asked to answer a similar question to identify countries with lowest revenue in the last recorded year, by month. To do this, you'll use the same query, but this time you'll use the `startofmonth` function to facilitate grouping by month. You'll also use the `arg_min()` aggregation function to find the countries with the smallest revenue in each month.

1. Run the following query.

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/ContosoSales?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAA22NPQvCQAyG90L/Q8Y7cNG9g1RcRAd1l9jGetpL5C4dKv54ryp+gFlCkvfJU3ZRxVOIeXaDkziGs+O6cMwUYIMtxTlWCsJQvpIL6ods7LzH4K4EW1Fsp146ViggpF6bdDUP+rm3Ns8g1b6HpbAeUy4qBpWDH0YzQ6X0145gTY0TLgco9Cv09OvC0Oy8Y/Pl/MPYt2igVS4wnnzcNcXqDuvWwxL3AAAA" target="_blank">Click to run query</a>

    ```kusto
    Customers
    | join kind=inner SalesFact on CustomerKey
    | summarize TotalAmount = round(sum(SalesAmount))
        by Month = startofmonth(DateKey), RegionCountryName
    | summarize arg_min(TotalAmount, RegionCountryName) by Month
    | top 12 by Month desc
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-join-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the join operator query, showing countries with lowest revenue.":::

1. Look at each row. Notice that the first column shows the months of the last year in descending order, followed by columns showing the total sales for the country with the least sales that month.

## Use the `leftouter` join kind

Your sales team wants to know the total sales per product category. You start by reviewing the available data and realize that you'll need the *Products* table to get the list of product categories and the *SalesFact* table to get the sales data. You also realize that you'll want to count the sales for each category and list all product categories, even ones that may not have sales.

Having analyzed the request, you choose to use the left outer join as it returns all records from the left table enriched with matching data from the right table. You write your query using the *Products* table as the left dimensions table, matching data from the *SalesFact* facts table, and grouping the result by product category, as follows:

1. Run the following query.

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/ContosoSales?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAA03MQQrCMBCF4b2neEt7iK4KboRSsBcYk1FSkwxMJouUHt6gCK7f979FxVdn5XRgk5DxCtmPkR8m1Vhxo8jlQs4gGcvXXrl1XWpKpGFnrGIUPxAjnNRs5wH39uMTGT9F20yJeyfq+2+f/zLPxb0BQv/+DokAAAA=" target="_blank">Click to run query</a>

    ```kusto
    Products
    | join kind=leftouter SalesFact on ProductKey
    | summarize TotalSales = count() by ProductCategoryName
    | order by TotalSales desc
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-join-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the join operator query, showing the total sales per product.":::

1. Notice that the execution time is 0.861 seconds, though this may vary between runs. This is one way to get this answer and is a good example of a query that isn't optimized for performance. Later, you'll compare this time with the execution time of an equivalent query using the `lookup` operator, which is optimized for this type of data.

## Use the `rightanti` join kind

Similarly, your sales team wants to know the number of products that don't sell in each product category. You can use a right anti join to get all the rows from the *Products* table that don't match any rows in the *SalesFacts* table, and then group the results by product category.

1. Run the following query.

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/ContosoSales?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAzWLQQqDQAxF954iSz2EK6Gbggg9QToTptFOApnMYoqHVymu/oP/3gu/VB4YvNthVRbYWOJonD6O4gyLaazBC6jc/KR2yqXmjMY/gkmrOIwQru0HeLfbnNApqbUZM52JWiS77n8RqYQDxNGqTH8AAAA=" target="_blank">Click to run query</a>

    ```kusto
    SalesFact
    | join kind=rightanti Products on ProductKey
    | summarize Count = count() by ProductCategoryName
    | order by Count desc
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-join-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the join operator query, showing the number of products that don't sell in each product category.":::

1. Look at each row. The results show the number of unsold products per product category. Notice that the right anti join only selects products that have no sales facts, indicating that there were no sales for products returned by the join.
