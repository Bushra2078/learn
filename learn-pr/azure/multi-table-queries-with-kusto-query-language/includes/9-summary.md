In this module, you learned to write optimized Kusto queries combining data from several tables and gain further insights as a result of enriching the data.
You used the `join`, `lookup`, `union` operators to combine data from several tables, and the `materialize()` function to cache results used more than once in a query, and other functions to answer questions about sales data.
