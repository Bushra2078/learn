In this module, you learned how to write optimized Kusto queries that combine data from several tables. You gained further insights as a result of enriching the data.

You used the `join`, `lookup`, and `union` operators to combine data from several tables, the `materialize()` function to cache results that are used more than once in a query, and other functions to answer questions about sales data.
