Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses, and a single DNS name for a set of Pods. Service manifest files contain instructions to expose Pods in a reliable way by defining a policy by how to connect with them. If a container image is redeployed, you don't need to reconfigure how to connect to the new image because of the instructions in the service manifest.

Ingress controllers define how your application can connect to the outside world. In the example scenario, smart fridges need to send messages to the Node.js container, and Ingress controllers determine the configuration of that connection.

In this unit, you will:

* Configure the ingress manifest so the container image can be accessed by outside applications
* Deploy the ingress controller
* Create a webapp using a Docker image

    ## Configure the ingress manifest

    To expose your container to the management webapp via DNS, you'll configure and deploy an ingress controller. You'll find the zone name to access the cna-express service and add to to the `ingress.yaml` file.

1. Identify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host allowed access to the cluster.

     In Cloud Shell, run the `az network dns zone list` command to query the Azure DNS zone list.

    ```bash
    az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP --name $CLUSTERNAME -o tsv --query addonProfiles.httpApplicationRouting.config.HTTPApplicationRoutingZoneName
    ```

1. Copy the output, and open the integrated editor in Cloud Shell by entering `code .`
1. Open the `ingress.yaml` file and replace the `<zone-name>` placeholder value with the `ZoneName` value you copied.

    The `ingress.yaml` file should match the following YAML, with `<exampleURL.eastus.aksapp.io>` **replaced by the output in step 7**.

    ```yaml
    #ingress.yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: cna-express
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: addon-http-application-routing
    spec:
      rules:
        - host: cna-express.<exampleURL.eastus.aksapp.io>
          http:
            paths:
              - backend: # How the ingress will handle the requests
                  serviceName: cna-express # Which service the request will be forwarded to
                  servicePort: http # Which port in that service
                path: / # Which path is this rule referring to
    ```

1. **Save the manifest file**, and close the editor.

    ### Deploy the ingress

    Now we need to deploy the service for our changes to take effect.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the `kubectl apply` command to submit the ingress manifest to your cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./ingress.yaml
    ```

    The command should output a result similar to the following example.

    ```output
    ingress.extensions/cna-express created
    ```

1. Return the Cloud Shell to the source folder.

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

    There could be a small delay between the creation of the ingress and the creation of the zone record. Let's load the webapp while this happens.

    ## Use a Docker image to create the webapp

    While AKS gets sets up, you can start to use the Container Registry to deploy the management webapp.

    You'll use the Docker image to deploy the webapp, which will require a username and password to perform this action. The ACR allows you to enable the registry name as the username and admin access key as the password to allow Docker to login to your container registry.

1. Return to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and go to **All resources**.

1. Select the container registry you created earlier, to navigate to the Overview page for the container registry.

1. In the left menu pane, under **Settings**, select **Access keys**.

1. Set the **Admin user** option to **Enable**. This change saves automatically.

    You're now ready to create your web app.

    ## Review the ingress

1. In the Cloud Shell, run the ` kubectl get ingress` command to check if the deployment was successful.

    ```bash
    kubectl get ingress cna-express
    ```

    The command should output a result similar to the following example.

    ```output
    NAME              HOSTS                                           ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
    cna-express       cna.5cd29ec927f24764b052.eastus.aksapp.io       52.226.96.30   80      4m44s
    ```

    Make sure the `ADDRESS` column of the output is filled with an IP address. That's the address of your cluster.

1. Let's query Azure to find out if our DNS has been created and we can access the website container.

    Run the `list` command to list all DNS zones again.

    ```bash
    az network dns zone list --output table
    ```

    The command should output a result similar to the following example.

    ```output
    ZoneName                               ResourceGroup                                 RecordSets    MaxRecordSets
    -------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------  ------------  ---------------
    5cd29ec927f24764b052.eastus.aksapp.io  mc_rg-contoso-video_aks-contoso-video_eastus  4             10000
    ```

1. Copy the `ZoneName` and `ResourceGroup` columns, and run the `az network dns` command. Replace the `<resource-group>` and `<zone-name>` value placeholders with the values you copied.

    ```bash
    az network dns record-set list -g <resource-group> -z <zone-name> --output table
    ```

    The command should output a result similar to the following example.

    ```output
    Fqdn                                            Name     ProvisioningState    ResourceGroup                                 Ttl
    ----------------------------------------------  -------  -------------------  --------------------------------------------  ------
    5cd29ec927f24764b052.eastus.aksapp.io.          @        Succeeded            mc_learn-cna-rg_cna-demo-aks_eastus           172800
    5cd29ec927f24764b052.eastus.aksapp.io.          @        Succeeded            mc_learn-cna-rg_cna-demo-aks_eastus           3600
    cna.5cd29ec927f24764b052.eastus.aksapp.io.      cna      Succeeded            mc_learn-cna-rg_cna-demo-aks_eastus           300
    cna.5cd29ec927f24764b052.eastus.aksapp.io.      cna      Succeeded            mc_learn-cna-rg_cna-demo-aks_eastus           300
    ```

    Make sure there are two new records at the bottom of the list with the host we created in the `host` key. The `ProvisioningState` value is `Succeeded`. It can take several minutes for zone records to propagate.

1. Open your browser, and go to your full aksapp.io FQDN URL described in the output. You should see a hello world message. **Remember to not to include the `.` from the end of the URL.**
