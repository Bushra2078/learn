Imagine you work for an online retail company. you've been asked to investigate methods to provide chat support to customers who are exploring and purchasing products on your company's website.

You plan to explore automating parts of your company's customer support tasks. You're considering using chat bots on your website and social-networking sites. The chat bot must be simple to create and manage, while being easy to extend with new features at a later time.

You'd also like to eventually build natural-language capabilities built into the bot. However, you don't have time or budget to develop your own language machine learning models.
