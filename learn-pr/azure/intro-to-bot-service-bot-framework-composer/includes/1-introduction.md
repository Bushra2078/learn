## Example scenario

Imagine you work for an online retail company. Your company’s marketing team wants you to explore how you can introduce customers to new products and help them select the company’s products. You explore automating customer chat support by using a chatbot on your website and social-networking sites. The chat bot should be simple to create and manage, but easy to extend later with new features. You'd also like to have natural language capabilities built into the bot in the near future, but don't have time or budget to develop your own language machine learning models. You decide to use Azure Bot Service and create your chat bots using the Azure Bot Framework Composer. These chat bots will help increase customer engagement and help you more effectively support your company’s customers.
