You can use The Azure Bot Service and Microsoft Bot Framework to design, build, deploy and host bots to provide enterprise grade conversational AI experiences. You can use Bot Framework Composer to design conversation logic and integration within a bot or extend bot functionality with code by using the Bot Framework SDK. Azure Bot Service lets you host bots and expose them to your users.

Imagine you work for an online retail company. You've been asked to investigate methods to provide chat support to customers who are exploring and purchasing products on your company's website.

You plan to explore automating parts of your company's customer support tasks. You're considering using chat bots on your website and social-networking sites. The chat bots must be simple to create and manage, while being easy to extend with new features at a later time.

You'd also like to eventually build natural-language capabilities built into the bots. However, you don't have time or budget to develop your own language machine learning models.

You'll consider using Azure Bot Service and creating your chat bots using Microsoft Bot Framework Composer. These chat bots can help increase customer engagement and help you more effectively support your companyâ€™s customers.

In this module, you'll be introduced to Azure Bot Service and its components and capabilities. You'll explore how the Azure Bot Service components work together to provide bot functionality on Azure. Also, you'll learn when to use Azure Bot Service and how to use Bot Framework Composer to design and build bots.
