Use Azure Bot Service to create custom bots that provide enhanced user experiences and augment applications. Examine bot functionality and design. Explore Azure Bot Service tools, including Bot Framework Composer, and when to use them.

Imagine you work for an online retail company. Your company’s marketing team wants you to explore methods to provide chat support to customers who are exploring and purchasing products on your company's website.

You want to explore automating customer chat support by using chat bots on your company's website and social-networking sites. The chat bot must be simple to create and manage, while being easy to extend with new features later.

You'd also like to have natural language capabilities built into the bot in the near future. However, you don't have time or budget to develop your own language machine learning models.

You'll consider using Azure Bot Service and creating your chat bots using Azure Bot Framework Composer. These chat bots can help increase customer engagement and help you more effectively support your company’s customers.

In this module, you'll be introduced to Azure Bot Service, its components, and its capabilities. You'll explore how the Azure Bot Service components work together to provide bot functionality on Azure, and when to use Azure Bot Service. You'll also examine how to design and build bots by using Bot Framework Composer.
