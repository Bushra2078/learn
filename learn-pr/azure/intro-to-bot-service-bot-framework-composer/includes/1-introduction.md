Design, build, deploy, and host bots using the Microsoft Bot Framework and Azure Bot Service to provide enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. 

Imagine you work for an online retail company. You've been asked to investigate methods to provide chat support to customers who are exploring and purchasing products on your company's website.

You plan to explore automating parts of your company's customer support tasks. You're considering using chat bots on your website and social-networking sites. The chat bots must be simple to create and manage, while being easy to extend with new features at a later time. You'd also like to eventually build natural-language capabilities built into the bots. However, you don't have time or budget to develop your own language machine learning models. You'll consider using Azure Bot Service and creating your chat bots using Microsoft Bot Framework Composer. These chat bots can help increase customer engagement and help you more effectively support your companyâ€™s customers.

In this module, you'll explore designing bots that have integrated conversational logic by using Bot Framework Composer. You'll learn about extending bot functionality with code by using the Bot Framework SDK. You'll learn how to design and build bots by using Bot Framework Composer, and how to host interactive bots on Azure Bot Service.
