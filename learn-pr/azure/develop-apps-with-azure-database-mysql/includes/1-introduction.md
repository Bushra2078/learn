**Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server** is a fully managed MySQL database as a service offering on Azure, that can handle mission-critical workloads with resiliency, predictable performance and dynamic scalability. It is a developer-friendly service that helps enhance productivity by reducing the overhead associated with managing a server running MySQL, while still providing control and customization options to fine-tune the server for performance. It is used in several popular use cases including internet-scale web and mobile applications, e-commerce applications, and gaming.

Flexible Server provides you the flexibility to develop applications using your favorite tools, languages, and frameworks, deploy faster by integrating with Azure services like App Services or AKS, and automate CI/CD tasks using GitHub or Azure DevOps.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a food delivery company and your team is responsible for managing a web-based platform that allows customers to view restaurant options, order food online, and select food delivery options.

Since your application and MySQL databases are hosted on-premises, developers on your team spend considerable time with server management tasks, governing security, and troubleshooting issues with the operating systems and databases. Recently, you have also noticed multiple performance issues and failures as your application is unable to handle the sudden bursts of user-requests during peak hours and weekends.

After researching, you have determined that moving to a cloud-based managed solution such as Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server would be a suitable option. This would help to resolve performance and availability issues, make database management easier, and reduce the burden on your developers. In parallel, you also want to improve your application performance by migrating to and modernizing your application architecture on Azure.

## What will we be doing?

You'll learn how to develop and deploy applications on Azure that integrate Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server on the backend. To do this, you'll:

- Query Azure Database for MySQL flexible server from your application.
- Evaluate and select the best application hosting options on Azure.
- Develop and deploy your application on Azure App Service, tapping into the power of the rich ecosystem of Azure services.
- Learn best practices for developing applications with Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build and deploy applications using the fully managed service Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server and integrate with other Azure services.
