Your first log analysis goal is to ensure you're getting data about all active virtual machines in your network. You want to identify machines that stop sending data to ensure you have full visibility of all active virtual machines.

Here, you'll write KQL queries to retrieve and transform data from the `heartbeat` table to obtain insights about the status of machines in your environment.  

## Assess log data based on analysis goals

Azure Monitor uses Azure Monitor Agent to collect data about activities and operating system processes running inside virtual machines. Some of the older machines in your environment still use the legacy Log Analytics Windows and Linux agents, which Azure Monitor is deprecating. Azure Monitor Agent and Log Analytics Agent log information about virtual machine health to the `Heartbeat` table once a minute.

1. What information do you need to determine which machines have stopped sending data?

    - All machines that have recently logged data, but have not logged data as expected in the past few minutes.
    - For further analysis, it's useful to know which virtual machine agent is running on each machine.
 
1. Which data in the `Heartbeat` table is relevant to your analysis and how will you use KQL to extract, transform, and organize the data?
    
    This screenshot shows the result set of a simple `take 10` query on the `Heartbeat` table (the table has other columns that are not shown in the screenshot):

    You can see that the columns that hold relevant data are:

    | Column | Description | Analysis goal | Related KQL operations |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | `TimeGenerated` | Indicates when the virtual machine generated each log. | <ul><li>Identify recently active machines.</li><li>Find the last log generated for each machine and check whether it was generated in the last few minutes.</li></ul> | <ul><li>`where TimeGenerated >ago(48h)`</li><li>`max(TimeGenerated)`</li><li>`max_TimeGenerated < ago(5m)`</li></ul> For more information, see [where operator](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/whereoperator), [ago()](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/agofunction), and [max() (aggregation function)](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/max-aggfunction). |
    | `Computer` |Unique identifier of the machine. | Summarize results by machine. |  <ul><li>`summarize`</li></ul> For more information, see [summarize operator](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/summarizeoperator). | 
    | `Category` |The agent type: <ul><li>`Azure Monitor Agent` or </li><li>`Direct Agent`, which represents the Log Analytics agents. The Log Analytics agent for Windows is also called MMA. The Log Analytics agent for Linux is also called OMS.</li></ul> | Identify the agent virtual running on the machine. Change the `Direct Agent` value to `MMA` for Windows machines and `OMS` for Linux machines to simplify the results and facilitate further analysis, such as filtering. | To simplify the results and facilitate further analysis, such as filtering: <ul><li>Rename the column to `AgentType` (`AgentType=Category`)</li><li> Change the `Direct Agent` value to `MMA` for Windows machines (`AgentType= iif(AgentType == "Direct Agent" and OSType =="Windows", "MMA", AgentType)`.</li><li> Change the `Direct Agent` value to `OMS` for Linux machines (`AgentType= iif(AgentType == "Direct Agent" and OSType =="Linux", "OMS", AgentType`).</li></ul> For more information, see [iff()](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/ifffunction) and [== (equals) operator](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/equals-cs-operator).|
    | `OSType` | The type of operating system running on the virtual machine. | Identify agent type for Log Analytics agents, which are different for each OS type. |  |

## Identify recently active machines that stopped logging data

To identify recently active machines that stopped logging data, write a query that lists the agents that have been active in the past 48 hours, but haven't logged data to the `Heartbeat` table in the last five minutes. 

1. Retrieve all logs from the past 48 hours:

    ```kusto
    Heartbeat // The table you’re querying
    | where TimeGenerated >ago(48h) // Time range for the query - in this case, logs generated in the past 48 hours
    ```

    The result set of this query likely includes numerous logs for each active machine.
    
1. Filter for the last log generated by each machine and summarize by computer, agent type, and operating system:     

    ```kusto
    Heartbeat // The table you’re querying
    | where TimeGenerated >ago(48h) // Time range for the query - in this case, logs generated in the past 48 hours
    | summarize max(TimeGenerated) by Computer, AgentType=Category, OSType // Summarizes records by unique combination of computer, agent type, and operating system, and retrieves the last record generated for each combination
    ```
    
    In the `summarize` line, you've renamed the `Category` column to `AgentType`, which better describes the information you're looking at in the column for this analysis.


1. Filter away all logs generated in the last five minutes:

    ```kusto
    Heartbeat // The table you’re querying
    | where TimeGenerated >ago(48h) // Time range for the query - in this case, logs generated in the past 48 hours
    | summarize max(TimeGenerated) by Computer, AgentType=Category, OSType // Summarizes records by unique combination of computer, agent type, and operating system, and retrieves the last record generated for each combination
    | where max_TimeGenerated < ago(5m) // Filters away all records generated in the last five minutes
    ```

    The result set of this query includes the last log generated by all machines that logged data in the past 48 hours, but doesn't include logs generated in the past five minutes. In other words, any machine that logged data in the last five minutes isn't included in the result set.

    You now have the data you're looking for: a list of all machines that logged data in the last 48 hours, but haven't been logging data as expected in the last five minutes. The result set consists of the set of computers you want to investigate further.

1. Manipulate the query results to present the information more clearly. 

    For instance, you decide to organize the logs by time generated - from the oldest to the newest - to see which computers have gone the longest time without logging data. 

    The `Direct Agent` value in the AgentType column tells you that the Log Analytics Agent is running on the machine. The Log Analytics Agent for Windows is also called OMS. The Log Analytics Agent for Linux is also call MMS. Renaming the `Direct Agent` value to `MMA` for Windows machines and `OMS` for Linux machines simplifies the results and facilitates further analysis, such as filtering.

    ```kusto
    Heartbeat // The table you’re querying
    | where TimeGenerated >ago(48h) // Time range for the query - in this case, logs generated in the past 48 hours 
    | summarize max(TimeGenerated) by Computer,AgentType=Category, OSType // Summarizes records by unique combination of computer, agent type, and operating system, and retrieves the last record generated for each combination
    | where max_TimeGenerated < ago(5m) // Filters away all records generated in the last five minutes
    | extend AgentType= iif(AgentType == "Direct Agent" and OSType =="Windows", "MMA", AgentType) // Changes the AgentType value from "Direct Agent" to "MMA" for Windows machines
    | extend AgentType= iif(AgentType == "Direct Agent" and OSType =="Linux", "OMS", AgentType) // Changes the AgentType value from "Direct Agent" to "OMS" for Linux machines
    | order by max_TimeGenerated asc // Sorts results by max_TimeGenerated from oldest to newest
    | project-reorder max_TimeGenerated,Computer,AgentType,OSType  // Reorganizes the order of columns in the result set
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > Use `max_TimeGenerated` to correlate the last heartbeat of the machine that stopped reporting with machine logs or other environmental events that occurred around the same time. Correlating logs in this way can help in finding the root cause of the issue you are investigating.
