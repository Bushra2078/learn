In this unit, we’ll discuss how you can decide whether Elastic on Azure is right for your workload and which deployment option is best.  

## Decision criteria

We’ll list criteria that you can use to help you decide if Elastic is right for you based on your:  

- Preferred operating system (OS) 
- Infrastructure control requirements 
- Search functionality  
- BI tool of choice 

## Apply the criteria 

Elastic on Azure helps you ingest, sort, and visualize data using a Linux OS on cloud infrastructure. It might not be the best option if your organization is transitioning to another cloud provider or standardizing on a different operating system such as Windows. You may also want to reconsider using Elastic on Azure if your organization already uses another BI tool besides Kibana for sharing information, such as Tableau or Power BI.

| Preferred operating system (OS)        | Elastic on Azure is a good choice for running your open-source Linux workloads on cloud infrastructure while leveraging the capabilities and features of the Elastic Stack.                                                                                                  |
| Infrastructure control requirements    | Elastic on Azure offers three deployment options that allow you to choose the right level of control based on your team’s work style preferences and existing application architectures, including support for your Kubernetes clusters.                                     |
| Search functionality                   | Elastic on Azure provides Elasticsearch functionality in Azure, which makes it a great choice for applications and workloads that rely heavily on finding and sorting data.                                                                                                   |
| BI tool of choice                      | Kibana, the built-in visualization tool that comes with Elastic, provides a seamless BI experience for your Linux applications and workloads. If you don’t have an existing BI tool, or want something more intuitive and integrated, Elastic on Azure is a good choice.     |
