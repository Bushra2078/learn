Elastic, built on the Elastic Stack, provides tools to help you search, analyze, monitor, and secure your apps and IT. The Elastic Stack, known as ELK Stack, is made up of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash.  

- Elasticsearch is a distributed, JSON-based search and analytics engine.
- Kibana helps you visualize and shape to your data and is the extensible user interface.
- Beats is a platform for lightweight shippers that send data from edge machines.
- Logstash is a dynamic data collection pipeline with an extensible plugin ecosystem.

When deploying on Azure, you can select from three different options, Elastic Cloud on Azure, Elastic on Azure Kubernetes Service, and Elastic on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).

## Elastic Cloud on Azure

Elastic Cloud gives you the power of Elastic Stack, including solutions for enterprise search, observability, and security. For most use cases, Elastic Cloud on Azure offers the fastest way to get value from your data. Your team focuses on onboarding and getting to work with your data while deployments are run, operated, patched, secured, and supported by the experts at Elastic. Choosing the fully managed service helps to eliminate costly overhead and compliance investments as well as reducing the risk of building a platform from the ground up or maintaining the platform as the enterprise grows.  

## Elastic on Azure Kubernetes Services

For users who need more control over the infrastructure that supports the Elastic deployment on Azure, you can deploy Elastic on AKS.

AKS provides users an enterprise-grade and operationally efficient way of deploying applications on Kubernetes infrastructure. Elastic Cloud Kubernetes operator provides users a highly efficient way to run Elastic on Kubernetes that includes built-in best practices.

## Elastic on Azure VMs  

Azure VMs provide Azure users a flexible way to deploy their Elastic workloads and manage the infrastructure underneath, providing them with more control and flexibility over other deployment options. This deployment option is best for teams that need to meet architectural or compliance constraints e.g. if their workloads must be deployed within their Azure tenant.  

Elasticâ€™s ARM template on Azure Marketplace provides a quick way to deploy Elastic using best practices.
