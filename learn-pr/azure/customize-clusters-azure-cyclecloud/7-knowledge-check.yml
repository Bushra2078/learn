  questions:
  - content: "You are editing an Azure CycleCloud template. You plan to add an extra Node section. To which parent section should you add it?"
    choices:
    - content: "cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A template must include at least one cluster section, containing one or more node and nodearray sections describing child objects of that cluster."
    - content: "nodearray"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A node section can be only nested within the cluster section."
    - content: "configuration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A configuration is a child object of a node or a nodearray object."
  - content: "You customized an Azure CycleCloud template. Now you want to create a cluster based on that template and start it afterwards. You want to minimize the number of steps to accomplish your goal. Which Azure CycleCloud CLI command should you run first?"
    choices:
    - content: "cyclecloud import_template"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This would allow you to import the template, but you'd still have to create the cluster before you can start it."
    - content: "cyclecloud import_cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This commmand allows you to create a cluster without explicitly importing the template."
    - content: "cyclecloud create_cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This requires that you first import the template."
  - content: "You created an Azure CycleCloud cluster based on the GitHub Slurm repository and configured its nodes with a cloud-init script. You need to connect to a cluster node from an Azure Cloud Shell session to validate that the script run successfully. What authentication method should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Slurm cluster nodes created based on the Azure CycleCloud GitHub Slurm repository do not support Azure Active Directory authentication."
    - content: "Active Directory Domain Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Slurm cluster nodes created based on the Azure CycleCloud GitHub Slurm repository do not support Active Directory Domain Services authentication."
    - content: "SSH keys"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This connection relies on SSH key-based authentication."
