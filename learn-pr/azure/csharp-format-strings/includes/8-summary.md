Our company needed to create a personalized marketing message to promote a new financial product to our customers.  Using C#, we were able to write code that combined string and numeric data about our current customers.

We used escape character sequences to insert whitespace, unicode, and other special characters.  We created verbatim string literals to avoid escaping in certain situations.  We exercised different techniques for merging a string template with variables using composite formatting and string interpolation.  The various specifiers allow us to properly format large numbers, currency, and percentages.  The built-in methods on variables of type string allowed us to add padding to left and right align data.

Imagine how much extra work would have required if we didn't have a wealth of string and number formatting tools and techniques available to us in C#.  We would likely attempt to use string concatenation everywhere, possibly making it difficult to maintain or update.

Techniques and tools for formatting strings and numeric data has a wide array of applications.  For example, we can use these techniques to present data for display on screen as well as format data to transfer between disparate systems.  It's a critical skill to master.  This module discussed some of the most popular and useful, but there are more.
