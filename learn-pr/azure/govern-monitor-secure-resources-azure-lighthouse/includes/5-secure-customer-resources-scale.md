Relecloud wants to ensure that resources and data for customers like Lamna Healthcare are secure. By using Azure Sentinel and Azure Lighthouse, you can help Relecloud secure customers’ tenants. You’ll explore how to use Azure Sentinel with Azure Lighthouse to detect and investigate security incidents across multiple customer tenants.

## Couple Azure Sentinel with Azure Lighthouse

With Azure Lighthouse, you can use Azure Sentinel to build a sophisticated Security as a service offering. Azure Sentinel provides features such as threat intelligence, alert detection, security analytics, and more. You couple Azure Lighthouse with Azure Sentinel to manage multiple Azure Sentinel customer workspaces simultaneously.

You can then run queries through multiple customer workspaces, or provide insights by creating workbooks that you use to monitor and visualize data across customer data sources. Playbooks, queries, and other intellectual property stay in your Azure tenant, but can make actions on customers’ tenants.

Here’s an overview of how to use Azure Lighthouse with Azure Sentinel:

### Centralized deployment model

Because you operate Azure Sentinel from a central location to manage all your customer’s Azure Sentinel workspaces, you can take advantage of the following benefits:

- Keep customer data isolated from other customers
- Ensure that customer data is stored within their tenant and that it stays within geographical boundaries
- Improved network latency when performing actions on customer workspaces
- Related costs are never charged to your tenant, but go directly to the customer for whom you’re providing services
- Integration with many customer data sources including Microsoft Threat Protection alerts, Azure Active Directory Activity logs, Microsoft 365 logs, and more
- Flexibility to accommodate the addition or removal of new customers, or their subsidiaries

### Manage Azure Sentinel using role-based access control (RBAC)

Because you use Azure Lighthouse to onboard customers through Azure delegated resource management, your managing users can access and perform actions directly on your customers' Azure Sentinel workspaces. To enable your managing users and service principals to do their jobs, you assign them the Azure Sentinel built-in RBAC roles:

|Role| Description|
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Azure Sentinel Reader**| Can view data, dashboards, incidents, and other   Azure Sentinel resources |
| **Azure Sentinel Responder**| Can perform all the actions of Azure Sentinel Reader, and manage incidents |
| **Azure Sentinel Contributor** | Can perform all the actions of Azure Sentinel Responder, but also create and edit dashboards, and analytic rules |

After customers have been onboarded, users sign in to your tenant to directly access customers’ workspaces, based on the roles assigned to them.

### Manage multiple workspaces

As a managing user, you open Azure Sentinel in the Azure portal to view a list of all the customer workspaces you can access.   You can choose to look at a single workspace, or expand your focus to multiple workspaces. Alternatively, you could investigate any incidents that have been detected across all your customers’ workspaces:

You can create a single Log Analytics query to run across all customer workspaces. This way, you'll investigate and correlate information from your customers in a single query. Use this query to gain a detailed understanding of your customers' tenants.

You can use a single Union operator and the workspace() expression to write your query like this:

```sql
Workspace(‘contoso/contosoretail/contosoretail-it’).SecurityEvent| union workspace(‘contosoretail-nl’).SecurityEvent,workspace(…)… | where …
```

KQL view functions make it easier to reuse complex queries like this. So you can save this whole expression into a single function called `cswSecurityEvent`:

```sql
cswSecurityEvent| where …
```

You can then use it run your query across all the workspaces.

### Use playbooks to respond to alerts

You create playbooks to mitigate alerts detected by Azure Sentinel. Playbooks help you to respond automatically or manually to alerts based on your needs. You can use a playbook that automatically responds to threats in a customer’s tenant. For customers who want to be more involved, you can deploy playbooks into their tenants, and configure them to allow users to be notified and act in response to threats.

### Use workbooks across tenants

You use Azure Sentinel with Azure Monitor workbooks to monitor and analyze data in customer Azure Sentinel workspaces. With Azure Monitor workbooks, you can create your own custom workbooks, but also use prebuilt templates:

You deploy workbooks in your tenant to query and monitor data in customer tenants through [cross-workspace monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants#using-cross-workspace-workbooks). But you can also deploy a workbook directly in a tenant that you manage for a customer.

### View incidents using Azure Sentinel workspaces
