  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which of the following is the definition of the term "network latency"?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The amount of throughput available on the network'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Network throughput is a measure of network capacity.'
    - content: 'The amount of time it takes for information to be sent from a source to a destination'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Latency is a measure of network transit time.'
    - content: 'The TTL of an asset in a content delivery network'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The TTL of an asset on a content delivery network relates to how often it's refreshed from the original source.'
    - content: 'A private circuit between an on-premises network and Azure'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure ExpressRoute is a private circuit between an on-premises network and Azure, and while it can improve latency, it isn't a definition of the term.'
 
  - content: 'Suppose your web application is hosted in East US. Which of the following is the most cost-effective way to optimize network latency for users around the world?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Deploy Azure ExpressRoute to each of your users.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure ExpressRoute is provisioned for a network location, not per user.'
    - content: 'Use a content delivery network to place assets and content closer to your users.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'By using a content delivery network, assets are cached at locations that are physically closer to users and reduces the amount of time to load them. A content delivery network cost-effectively improves network latency for users around the globe.'
    - content: 'Use Azure Traffic Manager in performance routing mode.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS load balancer that can help improve the time to connect to resources. It also requires locating web services in multiple locations and isn't the most cost-effective way to address this problem.'
    - content: 'Deploy more instances in East US to serve the extra user load.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Adding more instances will increase the amount of load the service in East US can handle but won't address the network latency for users distributed globally.'
