| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

From a performance perspective, it's ideal to have well-defined performance targets to start your design process. To set those targets, you need to have a good understanding of the business requirements and the anticipated quality of service that the workload is expected to deliver. Define the expectations in collaboration with the business stakeholders. Instead of only focusing on technical metrics, determine the acceptable effects on the user experience for the key flows.

There's a circular dependency. You can't measure what you haven't defined, and you can't define without measurement. So, it's also important to measure the workload performance until you achieve a satisfactory definition of acceptable threshold with collective agreement.

There's a strong correlation between performance and reliability targets, which help determine the quality of service in terms of performance, availability, and resilience. Without a clear definition, it's challenging to measure, alert for, and test performance. After you establish the targets and identify actual numbers through testing over time, you can implement automation for continuous testing against these targets.

Adhere to best practices in defining targets at the macro level, even if they're approximate or within a range.

**Example scenario**

Contoso Bicycle is a direct to consumer bicycle brand in the United States. Their development team has begun work on building an app in support of Contoso's planned mobile bicycle repair service offering. The app is currently in the proof of concept phase.  Technicians will use a mobile app to manage schedule, work orders, and payment. A website will be used for customers to schedule service.  The website and mobile app backend API is all likely to be hosted in Azure App Service.
