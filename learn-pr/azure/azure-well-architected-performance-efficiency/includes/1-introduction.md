Whether you're running a public facing application that handles massive amounts of traffic or an internal business API that manages critical data for internal systems, your users expect a system that performs well. Scaling your system to handle load, identifying network bottlenecks, and optimizing your storage performance are important to ensure your users have the best experience. In this module, we'll see how to make your application perform at its best. In this module you'll learn about the *Performance Efficiency* pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud.
