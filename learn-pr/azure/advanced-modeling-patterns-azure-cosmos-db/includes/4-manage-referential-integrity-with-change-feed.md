In the last section, you saw how denormalizing data can drastically improve performance and lower cost by providing the data needed by our e-commerce application in a single request. However, when data is denormalized like this, we need a way to maintain referential integrity between the master data in the productCategory and productTag containers, and the product container.

Luckily, Cosmos DB has a feature that can manage this called change feed. Change feed is an API that lives within every Cosmos DB container. Whenever data is inserted or updated to Cosmos DB, change feed streams these changes to an API that you can listen to. Then when an event is triggered, you can use that to execute code to respond to the data that was changed. In our e-commerce application here, you would use change feed to listen to the productCategory and propagate changes to the product container. Then, have a second change feed listening to the productTag container and doing the same thing.
