You've nearly finished remodeling your database. You've transformed nine relational database tables into four containers for your NoSQL database. Your customer container contains your customer and sales order data. The product container contains your products and many-to-many product tags. And the other two are the productTag and productCategory containers.

## One final optimization

There's one final optimization you could make. Have you noticed that the productCategory and productTag containers share the same partition key? As you might have guessed, because they share this key, you can put both entities into the same container and give it a more generic name, such as productMeta.

Now you can use queries like the ones you've learned about earlier to get all your product tags and product categories. This pattern works for any kind of master or reference data you need to maintain. To help maintain referential integrity across the entire database, change feed monitors this new container. So you can route any change to specific update functions by inspecting the `type` property when the new data is read by change feed.

## Your final design

Here then is your final design. With the merging of the product categories and tags, you've gone from nine relational tables to just three containers. Each one is optimized to serve your e-commerce application efficiently and scale to any size you need.
