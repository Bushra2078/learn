Imagine you work for a growing company that implemented Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) to support a critical service. You have your application running successfully in the new cluster, and your customers are actively using it.

You now need to ensure that the application is always available to customers and performing well. You also need to ensure that your support staff are immediately alerted to any problems with the cluster or application. You already use Azure Monitor to collect and analyze telemetry from your Azure services. You now need to know how to enable Container insights in Azure Monitor for your cluster and interpret the telemetry that it collects. You also now need to know how to configure alerts, so your support staff is proactively notified when thereâ€™s a problem.

Container insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that provides specialized monitoring for your Kubernetes clusters and the application workloads running on them. It gives you performance visibility by collecting memory and processor metrics from your Kubernetes controllers, nodes, and containers. After you enable monitoring for the cluster, metrics and container logs are automatically collected for you through a containerized version of the Azure Monitor agent. Log queries and workbooks included with Container insights allow you to effectively analyze this data and be proactively alerted to critical conditions.
