Microsoft uses extensive protections for the Azure cloud platform and offers a wide range of Azure services to help customers monitor and protect their provisioned cloud resources from attacks. Customers can deploy a range of Azure services to safeguard their applications and data and rely on the mature security and privacy incident management process that's in place.

## Microsoft Graph Security API

Aside from controls implemented by Microsoft to safeguard customer data, government customers deployed in Azure get considerable benefits from security research that Microsoft conducts to protect the cloud platform. Microsoft global threat intelligence is one of the largest in the industry and it’s derived from one of the most diverse sets of threat telemetry sources. It’s both the volume and diversity of threat telemetry that makes Microsoft machine learning algorithms applied to that telemetry so powerful.

The Microsoft [Graph Security API](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/graph-security-api?rtc=1) uses advanced analytics to synthesize large amounts of threat intelligence and security signals from across Microsoft products, services, and partners to combat cyberthreats. Millions of unique threat indicators across the most diverse set of sources are generated every day by Microsoft and its partners, then shared across Microsoft products and services. Across its portfolio of global services, each month Microsoft scans more than 400 billion email messages for phishing and malware, processes 450 billion authentications, executes more than 18 billion page scans, and scans more than 1.2 billion devices for threats. Importantly, this data always goes through strict privacy and compliance boundaries before being used for security analysis.

The Microsoft Graph Security API provides an unparalleled view into the evolving threat landscape and enables rapid innovation to detect and respond to threats. Machine learning models and Artificial Intelligence reason over vast security signals to identify vulnerabilities and threats. The Microsoft Graph Security API provides a common gateway to [share and act on security insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/security-concept-overview) across the Microsoft platform and partner solutions. Azure customers benefit directly from the Microsoft Graph Security API as Microsoft makes the vast threat telemetry and advanced analytics [available in Microsoft online services](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview), including Azure Security Center. These services can help customers address their own security requirements in the cloud.
