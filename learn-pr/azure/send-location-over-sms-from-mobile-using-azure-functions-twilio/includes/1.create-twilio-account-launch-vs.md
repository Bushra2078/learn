In this module you'll create a cross-platform Xamarin.Forms app, with a serverless back end. This app will get the users location from their device, and send it along with a list of phone numbers to an Azure Function. The Azure Function will then use a binding to a third-party service (Twilio) to send your location as an SMS message to all the phone numbers provided.

The following diagram shows the architecture used:

1. The app captures your location using Xamarin Essentials as an abstraction over device-specific location APIs.
2. The location and phone numbers are packaged up into a JSON payload and sent to an Azure Function.
3. The Azure Function decodes the JSON payload, and creates SMS messages.
4. The SMS messages are sent via [Twilio](http://twilio.com).

## Create a Twilio account

To be able to send SMS messages from an Azure Function, you'll need a Twilio account. Their free account is more than enough to get started.

1. Head to [twilio.com](https://twilio.com).
2. Click the red **Sign Up** button in the top-right corner.
3. Fill in your details and click **Get Started**.
4. You'll need to verify your phone number. Twilio free accounts only let you send messages to verified phone numbers to stop them being used for spam. Twilio will send you a verification code that you need to enter to verify your phone.
5. Provide a name for your first project, such as "I'm here".
6. From the Twilio messaging dashboard, click the **Console Dashboard** icon on the left (it has a home icon) and expand the **Project Info** panel. Take note of your **ACCOUNT SID** and **AUTH TOKEN** as you will need these values later.

## Launch Visual Studio

For this module, you'll develop the mobile app and Azure Functions app using Visual Studio 2017 available via a virtual machine. Although Xamarin.Forms apps can be built to run on iOS, Android and UWP, this module will just focus on UWP so that it works inside the lab virtual machine. Links will be provided for anything specific to the other platforms.

<!-- TODO - add HoL link button here -->

If you already have Visual Studio installed locally, then you can follow this module using your local install and run on Android and iOS as well as UWP if you have the right configuration. Check the [Xamarin installation docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/cross-platform/get-started/installation/windows) to make sure you have the correct workloads and SDKs installed, and the [UWP installation docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/cross-platform/develop-apps-for-the-universal-windows-platform-uwp#requirements) for the UWP SDK. You will also need the [Azure Development](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs#prerequisites) workload installed to allow creating Azure Functions projects.

If you want to follow this module on macOS using Visual Studio for Mac, then you won't be able to create the UWP project, and will have to target iOS or Android. You can find the installation instructions for Visual Studio for Mac in the [Xamarin docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/cross-platform/setup-and-install#mac-setup-apple-id-xcode-and-xamarin). The steps you will need to take to build and publish the app may also be different to those given in this module.

## Summary

In this unit, you created a Twilio account to use to send SMS messages, and launched Visual Studio. Next you learn how to create a Xamarin.Forms app and add the Xamarin Essentials NuGet package.
