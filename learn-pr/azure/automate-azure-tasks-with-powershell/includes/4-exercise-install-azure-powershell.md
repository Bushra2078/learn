In this unit, you will install **PowerShell** on your local machine.

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise guides you through installing the PowerShell tools locally. The remainder of the module will use the Azure Cloud Shell so you can leverage the free subscription support in Microsoft Learn. You can consider this exercise as an optional activity and just review the instructions if you prefer.

## Linux

Installing PowerShell for Linux will involve using a package manager. We will use **Ubuntu 18.04** for our example here, but we have [detailed instructions for other versions and distributions in our documentation](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux).

You will install PowerShell on Ubuntu Linux using the Advanced Packaging Tool (**apt**) and the Bash command line.

1. Import the encryption key for the Microsoft Ubuntu repository. This will allow the package manager to verify that the PowerShell package you install comes from Microsoft.

    ```bash
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

1. Register the **Microsoft Ubuntu repository** so the package manager can locate the PowerShell package.

    ```bash
    sudo curl -o /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/prod.list
    ```

1. Update the list of packages.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

1. Install PowerShell.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y powershell
    ```

1. Start PowerShell to verify that it installed successfully.

    ```bash
    pwsh
    ```

## MacOS

On macOS, the first step is to install **PowerShell**. This is done using the Homebrew package manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the **brew** command is unavailable, you may need to install the Homebrew package manager. For details see the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).

1. Install Homebrew-Cask to obtain more packages, including the PowerShell package:

    ```bash
    brew install --cask powershell
    ```

1. Start PowerShell to verify that it installed successfully:

    ```bash
    pwsh
    ```

## Windows

Windows PowerShell is included with Windows, however it's recommended that you install PowerShell 7.0.6 LTS, PowerShell 7.1.3, or higher for use with the Azure Az PowerShell module. You can check the version you have installed through the following steps:

1. Open the **Start** menu and type **PowerShell**. There may be multiple shortcut links available:
    - PowerShell 7 (x64) - this is the 64-bit version and generally what you should choose.
    - Windows PowerShell - this is the 64-bit version included with Windows.
    - Windows PowerShell (x86) - this is a 32-bit version installed on 64-bit Windows.
    - Windows PowerShell ISE - The Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) is used for writing scripts in Windows PowerShell.
    - Windows PowerShell ISE (x86) - A 32-bit version of the ISE on Windows.

1. Select the PowerShell icon.

1. Type the following command to determine the version of PowerShell installed.

    ```powershell
    $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
    ```

If the major version number is lower than 7.0.6 or 7.1.3, follow these instructions for [upgrading existing Windows PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell#upgrading-existing-windows-powershell).

You have setup your local machine(s) to support PowerShell. Next, we will talk about additional commands you can add including the Azure Az PowerShell module.
