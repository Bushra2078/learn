Server administrators know they must use remote management tools to be able to administer and maintain cloud-based resources. But they want to avoid exposing the remote management interfaces of those VMs to the internet? 

In this module, you have learned that Azure Bastion enables you to securely connect to your Azure VMs remotely, without needing to expose remote administrative ports to the internet. You learned about how Azure Bastion helps protect your hosted VMs because it:

- Provides the convenience of securely using both RDP/SSH to manage remote VMs
- Avoids exposing RDP/SSH ports to the internet

You should now be able to determine how you can use Azure Bastion to help secure remote management sessions to your Azure hosted VMs. Consider using Azure Bastion when:

- You have remote Azure hosted VMs to manage
- You want avoid having to maintain the method by which you connect to these remote VMs
- You don't want to have to configure network security group settings to enable remote management
