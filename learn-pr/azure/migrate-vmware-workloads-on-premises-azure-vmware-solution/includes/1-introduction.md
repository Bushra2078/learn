## Example scenario

Imagine you work for a healthcare company that runs production workloads on a VMware platform. Your company has decided to migrate existing VMware workloads to Azure VMware Solution (AVS). By using AVS, your company doesn't have to change virtualization platforms or alter existing operational patterns. You've planned for and deployed AVS. Now you need to migrate VM workloads on-premises to Azure. In this module, you'll learn how to migrate existing VMware workloads on-premises into Azure VMware Solution.

## Module summary

First, you'll learn how to plan for the HCX deployment on-premises. From there, you'll learn how to deploy HCX on-premises and connect it to Azure VMware Solution. Additionally, you'll learn about the steps required to ensure the service is configured correctly. After HCX is deployed, you'll learn how to migrate VMware workloads on-premises to AVS. Learning all these steps will help out your business by quickly migrating VMware workloads into Azure VMware Solution.

## Learning objectives

- Configure Hybrid Cloud Exchange (HCX) to support on-premises VMware migrations.
- Migrate VMware workloads on-premises to Azure VMware Solution.
