Imagine you work for a healthcare company that runs production workloads on a VMware platform. Your company has decided to migrate existing VMware workloads to Azure VMware Solution (AVS). By using AVS, your company doesn't have to change virtualization platforms or alter existing operational patterns. You've planned for and deployed AVS. Now you need to migrate VM workloads on-premises to Azure. In this module, you'll learn how to migrate existing VMware workloads on-premises into Azure VMware Solution.

## Learning objectives

- Configure Hybrid Cloud Exchange (HCX) to support on-premises VMware migrations.
- Migrate VMware workloads on-premises to Azure VMware Solution

## Prerequisites

- Experience managing VMware infrastructure, such as vSphere, vCenter, NSX-T, and HCX.
- Basic knowledge of network concepts, such as classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), ports, and subnets.

## Module summary

First, you'll learn how to plan for the Hybrid Cloud Exchange (HCX) Connector deployment on-premises. From there, you'll learn how to deploy the HCX Connector on-premises and connect the appliance to Azure VMware Solution. Additionally, you'll learn about the steps required to ensure the service is configured correctly. After HCX is deployed and configured, you'll learn how to migrate VMware workloads on-premises to AVS. Learning about all these steps will help your business out by quickly migrating VMware workloads into Azure VMware Solution.
