Remember that VMware HCX (HCX) Advanced deploys by default when Azure VMware Solution deploys in Azure. Before configuring site pairings for your migration, the next step involves deployment and configuration of HCX Connector on-premises. 

To complete the exercises, you'll need access to an Azure subscription, with contributor rights assigned to configure an Azure VMware Solution environment.

## Download VMware HCX Connector
Before you deploy HCX Connector in the on-premises vCenter, download the VMware HCX Connector OVA file from the Azure portal.

1. Search for and select the Azure VMware Solution private cloud in the Azure portal.

1. Under **Manage**, select **Add-ons**.

1. Select the **Migration using HCX** tab, place a check mark next to **I agree with terms and conditions**, and select **Enable and deploy**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-enable-deploy-hcx.png" alt-text="Screenshot displaying how to enable the HCX add-on within the Azure portal.":::

1. This action triggers a build of VMware HCX Advanced within the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

1. After the build completes, you should see a similar screen as what's shown below:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-hcx-deployment-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot displaying that the HCX add-on installed after enabling the service within the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.":::

1. Within the Azure VMware Solution resource, under **Manage**, select **Add-ons** again.

1. Underneath **Migration using HCX**, you should now see **HCX plan**, **Configure HCX appliance**, and **Connect with on-premise using HCX keys**. All of these new options for configuration built out during the HCX Advanced deployment on the private cloud.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-migration-hcx-start.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that the HCX add-on is enabled and that there are more options to configure after the add-on finishes installing.":::

1. Underneath **Connect with on-premise using HCX keys**, select **+ Add** to generate a key that you'll use for the on-premises HCX Connector installation.

1. Supply an HCX key name and you'll see the activation key show up within this pane. This is the key you'll use to activate the on-premises HCX Connector appliance.

1. Under **Manage** on the Azure VMware Solution private cloud, select **Identity** again.

1. The URLs and user credentials for the Azure VMware Solution vCenter and NSX-T Manager will appear. Use the copy feature to paste credential information into the web browser on the jump host VM.

     :::image type="content" source="../media/3-display-user-credentials.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to find the vCenter and NSX sign-in information in the Azure portal.":::

1. Open a browser window within the jump host behind Azure Bastion. Sign in to the Azure VMware Solution HCX Manager on 'https://x.x.x.9' over port 443. Replace the x's with the CIDR address block used to configure with Azure VMware Solution.

1. Use the *cloudadmin@vsphere.local* user credentials to sign in.

1. Within HCX Cloud Manager, select **Administration** > **System Updates** > **Check for Updates**.

1. After HCX checks for a software update, select **Request Download Link**.

## Activate VMware HCX
After deploying and powering on the VMware HCX Connector appliance on-premises, you activate HCX Connector. You need to get a license key from the Azure VMware Solution environment in Azure.

1. Under **Manage** > **Connectivity**, select the HCX tab, and then select **+ Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-add-hcx-key-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot to add the HCX Advanced key in the Azure portal.":::
