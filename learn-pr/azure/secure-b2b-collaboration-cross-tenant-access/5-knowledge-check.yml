  questions:
  - content: "How would you make sure that no one from any external Microsoft Entra organization can use B2B collaboration to access your applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure your organizational settings to block inbound B2B collaboration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Organizational settings apply to a specific Microsoft Entra organization only. If you want to block access by all external organizations, you would configure your default inbound settings for B2B collaboration."
    - content: "Configure your default cross-tenant access settings to block all outbound B2B collaboration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Outbound settings apply to cases where your users are invited to external organizations for B2B collaboration. In this case, you would want to block all inbound B2B collaboration so that external users can't access applications in your organization."
    - content: "Configure your default cross-tenant access settings to block all inbound B2B collaboration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: "In addition to cross-tenant access settings, what are some other settings that affect B2B collaboration with other organizations?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cross-tenant access settings are the only settings that affect B2B collaboration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Cross-tenant access settings let you apply access policies to your collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations. External collaboration settings give you additional controls over collaboration with any organization."
    - content: "External collaboration settings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. External collaboration settings apply to collaboration with any organization (not just other Microsoft Entra organizations). They let you determine who can invite external users, block individual domains, and define guest users' access to your directory."
    - content: "Organizational sharing configuration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. This isn't one of the settings available in Microsoft Entra ID."
  - content: "Where can you configure a setting to trust multi-factor authentication from all other Microsoft Entra organizations?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cross-tenant access settings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In your default cross-tenant access settings, you can enable the **Trust setting** named **Trust multifactor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants**."
    - content: "External collaboration settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The **Trust multifactor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants** is one of the options available in cross-tenant access settings."
    - content: "You can only trust multi-factor authentication from individual organizations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. You can trust multi-factor authentication by default (for all external Microsoft Entra organizations) or for individual Microsoft Entra organizations."
