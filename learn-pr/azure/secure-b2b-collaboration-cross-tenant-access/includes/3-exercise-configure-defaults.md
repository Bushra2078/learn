In this exercise, we'll configure default cross-tenant access settings. These settings represent the B2B collaboration policies you generally want to apply to all external Microsoft Entra organizations.

Recall that in the financial institution example, you want to allow outbound B2B collaboration for all of your internal employees. But you want to protect your internal accounting applications by blocking all inbound B2B collaboration by default. The only users you want to be able to access your internal accounting applications are users from the newly acquired branch, which we'll configure later. Right now, we'll configure your default cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations in general.

To try this exercise yourself, you need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) and add a subscription before you begin. If you're a student, you can take advantage of the [Azure for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?azure-portal=true) offer.

## Set default outbound cross-tenant access

Here, you'll configure your default outbound settings for B2B collaboration. You'll make sure your cross-tenant access settings will allow other Microsoft Entra organizations to invite your users to their organization for B2B collaboration.

## Set default inbound cross-tenant access

Now, you'll configure your default inbound settings to block all inbound B2B collaboration. You'll make sure your cross-tenant access settings will block everyone in other Microsoft Entra organizations from being invited to your organization for B2B collaboration.

1. On the main **Cross-tenant access settings**, select the **Default settings** tab.
1. Under **Inbound access settings**, select **Edit inbound defaults**.

   ![Screenshot highlighting the Edit inbound defaults link.](../media/3-edit-inbound-defaults.png)

1. Select **B2B collaboration**.
1. With **External users and groups** selected, make sure **Access status** is set to **Block access**.
1. Under **Applies to**, make sure **All external users and groups** is selected.

   ![Screenshot showing users and groups settings with access blocked for all users.](../media/3-default-users-groups-blocked.png)

1. Because the users and groups setting and the applications setting need to match, select **Applications**, and then select **Block Access**. Make sure **All applications** is selected.

   ![Screenshot showing applications settings with access blocked for all users.](../media/3-default-applications-blocked.png)

1. Select **Save**. Select **External Identities** in the breadcrumbs at the top of the page to return to the main **Cross-tenant access settings** page. Then go on to the next section.

    ![Screenshot showing the External Identities breadcrumb after applications settings.](../media/3-breadcrumb.png)
## Check your work

On the main **Cross-tenant access settings** page:

- In the **Inbound access settings** section, you should see two **B2B collaboration** rows. The **External users and groups** and **Applications** rows should both have a **Status** of **All blocked**.
- In the **Outbound access settings** section, you should see two **B2B collaboration** rows. Both of these rows should have a **Status** of **All allowed**.

   ![Screenshot showing default settings with outbound access All allowed and inbound access All blocked.](../media/3-default-all-blocked.png)

All your users can now be invited by other Microsoft Entra organizations to use B2B collaboration, but all external Microsoft Entra users are blocked from using B2B collaboration to access your applications.
