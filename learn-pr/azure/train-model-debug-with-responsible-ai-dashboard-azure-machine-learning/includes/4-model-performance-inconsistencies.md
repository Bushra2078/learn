An effective approach to evaluating the performance of machine learning models is getting a holistic understanding of their behavior across different scenarios. One way to approach this includes calculating and assessing model performance metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, root mean squared error (RSME), mean absolute error (MAE), or R2 scores. However, just analyzing one metric or alternatively, the aggregated metrics for the overall model is insufficient to debug a model and identify the root cause of errors or inaccuracies. In conjunction with measuring performance metrics, data scientists and AI developers need to conduct comparative analysis to aid their holistic decision making.

Comparative analysis shines a light on how models are performing for one subgroup of the dataset versus another. One of the advantages is that the Model Overview component of the Responsible AI  dashboard in Azure Machine Learning is not just reliant on high-level numeric calculations on datasets, it dives down to the data features as well. This is especially important when one cohort has certain unique characteristics compared to another cohort. For example, discovering that the model is more erroneous with a cohort that has sensitive features (e.g., patient race, gender or age) can help expose potential unfairness.
