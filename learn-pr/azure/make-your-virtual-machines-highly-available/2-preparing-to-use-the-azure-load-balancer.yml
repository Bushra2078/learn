  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "True or False: Azure Load Balancer can be used for either public-facing services or for internal Azure services?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Azure offers both public and internal load balancers. Public load balancers handle client requests from outside the Azure infrastructure and have a public IP address. Internal load balancers process requests from within a virtual network."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Azure offers both public and internal load balancers. Public load balancers handle client requests from outside the Azure infrastructure and have a public IP address. Internal load balancers process requests from within a virtual network." 

  - content: "Which service does a load balancer use to determine if a virtual machine is ready to handle requests?"
    choices:
    - content: "Status checker"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to a virtual machine only if a health probe determines that the virtual machine is available and operational."
    - content: "Availability monitor"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to a virtual machine only if a health probe determines that the virtual machine is available and operational."
    - content: "Health probe"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to a virtual machine only if a health probe determines that the virtual machine is available and operational."

  - content: "Suppose you're using an Azure Load Balancer to manage the distribution of traffic between three virtual machines. True or false: if a client makes multiple requests with different source ports, the same virtual machine is guaranteed to be used to handle each request?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Azure Load Balancer uses a hash-based algorithm based off data including the source port of the client's request. A different source port would generate a new hash and the load balancer may send this traffic to any of the three virtual machines."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Azure Load Balancer uses a hash-based algorithm based off data including the source port of the client's request. A different source port would generate a new hash and the load balancer may send this traffic to any of the three virtual machines."
