  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you have a load balancer that distributes requests to resources within a virtual network and is not accessible from the internet. This is an example of which type of load balancer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Public load balancer"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "An internal load balancer processes requests from within a virtual network and is not accessible from the internet."
    - content: "Internal load balancer"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "An internal load balancer processes requests from within a virtual network and is not accessible from the internet." 

  - content: "Which of the following services do load balancers use to determine if a virtual machine can handle requests?"
    choices:
    - content: "Status checker"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to virtual machines only if a health probe determines it's available and operational."
    - content: "Availability monitor"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to virtual machines only if a health probe determines it's available and operational."
    - content: "Health probe"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to virtual machines only if a health probe determines it's available and operational."

  - content: "True or False: Azure Load Balancer uses a hash-based algorithm to ensure all packets within a client flow are sent to the same virtual machine instance?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Azure Load Balancer's hash-based algorithm uses data like the source and destination IP address to ensure all packets within a packet client flow are sent to the same backend virtual machine instance."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Azure Load Balancer's hash-based algorithm uses data like the source and destination IP address to ensure all packets within a packet client flow are sent to the same backend virtual machine instance."
