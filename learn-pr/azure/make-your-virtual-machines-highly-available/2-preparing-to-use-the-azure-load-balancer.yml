  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "True or False: Azure Load Balancer can be used for public-facing services, or for internal Azure services?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Public load balancers handle client requests from outside the Azure infrastructure and have a public IP address, whereas, internal load balancers process requests from within a virtual network."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Public load balancers handle client requests from outside the Azure infrastructure and have a public IP address, whereas, internal load balancers process requests from within a virtual network." 

  - content: "Which of the following services do load balancers use to determine if a virtual machine can handle requests?"
    choices:
    - content: "Status checker"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to virtual machines only if a health probe determines that the virtual machine is available and operational."
    - content: "Availability monitor"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to virtual machines only if a health probe determines that the virtual machine is available and operational."
    - content: "Health probe"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Load balancers will distribute traffic to virtual machines only if a health probe determines that the virtual machine is available and operational."

  - content: "Suppose you're using an Azure Load Balancer to manage the distribution of traffic between three virtual machines and a client is making multiple requests, each with different source ports. True or false: the same virtual machine is guaranteed to be used to handle each request?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Azure Load Balancer uses a hash-based algorithm based off data including the source port of the client's request. A different source port would generate a new hash and the load balancer may send this traffic to any of the three virtual machines."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Azure Load Balancer uses a hash-based algorithm based off data including the source port of the client's request. A different source port would generate a new hash and the load balancer may send this traffic to any of the three virtual machines."
