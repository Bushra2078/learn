Suppose you work as the server administrator for a large bank. You are launching a new banking portal for your customers that will enable them to easily check their account from the Internet or mobile device. The application is business-critical, and you want to minimize the downtime that results from server failure or upgrades to the software.

Since you are launching on Azure, you want to take advantage of some of the scalability options it provides. Your goal is to determine if a load balancer is appropriate for this type of application, and if so, how to deploy and configure the system.

- Decide when to use a load balancer
- Identify the differences between the basic and standard Load Balancer editions
