Imagine that you work for a retail startup that's designing a database to manage online orders. You're working on a proposal for an efficient database design. You've been given a relational model to start from. To improve scalability and performance, you want to migrate the model to noSQL. But to do so the data needs to be modeled correctly to realize the best efficiency and performance. You've modeled most of the entities so far but there are additional entities and further optimizations to make.
