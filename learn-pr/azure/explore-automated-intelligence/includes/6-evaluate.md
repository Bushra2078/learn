The most important thing to remember from these three types of automated methods (math – control theory, menus – optimization algorithms, and manuals – expert systems or expert rules) is their strengths (when should you use each technology) and their limitations, as it is presented in table 1. Together with the Autonomous intelligence methods, it will allow us to select the best technology to solve each task or module in the Machine Teaching new AI paradigm.

The limitations of Automated methods are going to give us a hint of where other Autonomous Intelligence technologies, such as Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning, can be used.

The strengths of Automated methods will complement Autonomous Intelligence technologies in their weaknesses.

Note: To learn about Autonomous Intelligence technologies, their strengths and weaknesses, review Module 2 – Introduction to Autonomous Intelligence.
