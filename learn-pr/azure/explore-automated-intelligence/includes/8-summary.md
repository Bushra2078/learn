In this module you’ve learned Automated Intelligence technologies include math (control theory), menus (optimization algorithms) and manuals (expert systems and expert rules). All of them have been widely used in the industry for decades. 

Control theory uses math to decide on the next action. They're unexpensive, reliable, predictable, and explainable. They don't work well when the model of the system isn't known, or when the relationship between the variables is nonlinear.

Optimization algorithms perform a search of the space and create a list of options (or menu) ranked by an objective criterion. They're the best technology when we don’t know much about the problem or when there are constraints to comply with. The main drawback of these algorithms is the high use of computational resources, which also makes them slow.

Expert systems behave as an expert in a narrow application domain. The best time to use them is when we have lots of expertise in the area, and/or when there are a lot of constraints to comply with. Also, when we need to have an explanation to back up the decision taken. Their limitation is that it's tedious to maintain.

These technologies are potential components of an Autonomous AI brain design implemented using the new AI paradigm of Machine Teaching.
