Automated decision-making calculates the best next action to take by a device or industrial process. It is used mostly in machines, vehicles and industrial settings. It is very well understood and reliable.

Automated systems use three primary methods to make decisions:

- **Math**: It includes a set of technologies known as control theory. It makes automated decisions based on mathematical models of the system and calculates the next decision by using physics, chemistry and math.
- **Menus**: It includes a set of technologies known as optimization algorithms. It searches for potential solutions and then chooses the best decision from the options based on an objective criteria. 
- **Manuals**: It includes expert systems and expert rules. It captures and codifies existing expertise from previous exploration and then uses them to decide the next action to take.

Most automated systems are hybrid and use one or more of these methods. For example, predictive control in the chemical industry and oil and gas industry uses a combination of control theory and optimization algorithms.
