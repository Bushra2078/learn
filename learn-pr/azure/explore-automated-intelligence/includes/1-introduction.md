**Automated intelligence** refers to a group of technologies to automate manual, repetitive tasks to reduce human intervention in processes. Automated Intelligence provides many benefits across industries as they are relatively easy to program, and they are predictable, explainable and maintainable.

The intent behind the superficial study of these methods is to know what is being used in industrial applications currently and why, i.e. their strengths. Automation has been used for decades providing huge business value. We want to respect currently-used technologies and the engineers (some of them with PhD in these methods) using them. We also want to be able to use these methods when they are the most appropriate to solve the problem, as they are the simplest, most robust, explainable and accepted methods in the industry. Yet, we also want to explain their limitations, so we can add other AI technologies using the Machine Teaching methodology to outperform these current methods.

The main limitation of Automated Intelligence today is the lack of adaptability to environment changes. The systems that use automated intelligence technologies rely on understanding how inputs interact to affect outputs. Every process is programmed to execute a specific action. As a result, these systems are rigid and cannot adapt to the changing environment variables.

Here is an example of the behavior of an Automated system. A Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine is programmed to cut a hole in a piece of steel that will become a car door. The automated system ensures that that machine will cut the same 2-inch hole every time with next to zero variations. Assuming that the car door is built to specification and always placed perfectly on the line, the CNC executes its task perfectly every single time. But, if the door is placed slightly off-center, or the material is a few microns too thick, then the machine fails, and the process falls apart.
