Suppose you are the network architect at a regional healthcare provider. The organization has migrated much of its infrastructure to Azure. You would like to connect your data center and larger regional facilities to Azure. You need secure connectivity so that patient health information is protected while it's traversing the network. You don't currently have the bandwidth requirements for a dedicated circuit, and are looking for a way to integrate these networks in a cost-effective manner.

The Virtual Private Network (VPN) Gateway options in Azure will help the healthcare provider meet their connectivity requirements. You'll see how this is done by creating and testing VPNs to securely connect sites to Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify the features and use cases of VPN Gateways
- Understand the requirements for provisioning a VPN Gateway
- Provision site-to-site VPN Gateways
