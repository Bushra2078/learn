Suppose you're the network architect at a regional healthcare provider. The organization has migrated much of its infrastructure to Azure. You'd like to connect your datacenter and larger regional facilities to Azure. You need secure connectivity so that patient health information is protected while it's traversing the network. You don't currently have the bandwidth requirements for a dedicated circuit, and you're looking for a way to integrate these networks in a cost-effective way.

The virtual private network (VPN) gateway options in Azure can help this healthcare provider meet its connectivity requirements. You'll see how this is done by creating and testing VPNs to securely connect sites to Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify the features and use cases of VPN gateways
- Understand the requirements for provisioning a VPN gateway
- Provision site-to-site VPN gateways

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Azure virtual networking
