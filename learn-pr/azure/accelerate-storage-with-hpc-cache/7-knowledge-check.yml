## Knowledge Check
content: |
quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following explanations best describes Azure HPC Cache?"
    choices:
    - content: "A managed service for accelerating storage for HPC workloads."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's right. The HPC Cache managed service accelerates storage for HPC workloads."
    - content: "A Linux-based virtual machine for accelerating compute for HPC workloads."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache is more than a VM and does not accelerate compute, but it does help better utilize compute resources."
    - content: "A third-party Marketplace image for accelerating networking for HPC workloads."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache is a Microsoft technology that often reduces WAN bandwidth but is not a network accelerator."
  - content: "To reach on-premises NFS storage, what two permissions are required to create Azure HPC Cache?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure permissions to create NICs and storage permissions like `no_root_squash`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure user needs to have permissions to create NICs. And for on-prem access, `no_root_squash` must be enabled on the storage target's export(s)."
    - content: "Azure account owner to create resource groups and domain admin to join the cache to Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache does not require Azure account ownership and does not join Active Directory."
    - content: "Storage admin to create local exports and root squash to deny unauthorized users"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Exports are not needed to create an Azure HPC Cache. And root squash must be disabled on the storage target exports."
  - content: "When creating the cache, which sizing option is best?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cache sizes slightly smaller than the working set are best in order to best use resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Smaller caches are inefficient because the cache has to drop data to read in new data."
    - content: "Type the exact size of your working set so the cache size is neither too big nor too small."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache sizes are fixed. There is nowhere to type a cache size."
    - content: "Cache sizes slightly larger than the working set are best in order to store all the data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes. Larger cache sizes hold all the data for the HPC tasks."
  - content: "For the HPC Cache to connect to on-prem data, what is the recommended network path should it take?"
    choices:
    - content: "VPN because data should treated as sensitive and therefore be kept encrypted"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "VPNs can be used but they are often slower than dedicated network circuits."
    - content: "ExpressRoute because a high-speed connection allows faster data transfer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ExpressRoute is the best answer because we want a high-speed connection between the storage target and the cache."
    - content: "LAN because local traffic travels faster than traffic among multiple networks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure HPC Cache does not sit in a customer's LAN so LAN-only traffic won't reach the cache."
