title: Accelerate high-performance computing storage with Azure HPC Cache  
summary: Create a virtual caching solution for NFS storage. Client machines will connect to the cache, read data, and process the data.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to: 
    - Understand what an Azure HPC Cache is.
    - List the pre-requisites for an Azure HPC Cache.
    - Create an Azure HPC Cache.
    - Configure an Azure HPC Cache to accelerate a Linux-based filesystem.
    - Attach virtual client machines to read from the cache.
prerequisites: |
  - Familiarity with NFS storage concepts such as mount, export, and namespace.
  - Familiarity with networking concepts such as subnet, DNS, and TCP/UDP ports.
  - Familiarity with creating virtual machines in the Azure portal.
