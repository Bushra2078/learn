In this module, you learned how Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services provide developers with APIs to create applications that take advantage of Azure's speech-to-text features.

You created an Azure Cognitive Services account, which you used to create two speech-to-text applications:

- A command-line application that used single-shot recognition to convert simple speech to text.

- A command-line application that used continuous recognition to convert extended speech to text.

You also learned how you can improve your recognition results by providing a list of phrases that might be unfamiliar to the speech recognition engine.
