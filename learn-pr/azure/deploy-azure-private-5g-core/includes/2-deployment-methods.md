You can deploy Azure Private 5G Core network using one of the three methods:

- Using Azure portal - Sign into the Azure portal to deploy a private mobile network to match your enterprise's requirements.
- Using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates - An [ARM template](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your deployment. The template uses declarative syntax. In declarative syntax, you describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment.
For more information on using ARM templates for deployment, see [Deploy a private mobile network and site - ARM template - Azure Private 5G Core Preview | Microsoft Learn](/azure/private-5g-core/deploy-private-mobile-network-with-site-arm-template).
- Using the Azure REST APIs - This method is best suited for advanced system integrators and solution developers.
