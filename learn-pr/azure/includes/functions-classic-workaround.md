We are currently working to update our sandbox to support the new workflow for creating an Azure Function in the portal. The instructions will be updated when that is available. Until then, you can use the version of the create experience that matching the current instructions by clicking the notification bar labeled **Looking for the classic Function App create experience?** at the top of the **Function App** page. This experience can also be reached by choosing the **Function App (Classic)** option from the Azure Marketplace.
