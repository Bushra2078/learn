1. In a browser, navigate to [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true). Sign in or create a new account.

1. If you're creating a new account, follow the prompts to create an Azure DevOps organization. Azure DevOps then asks you to create a new project. Continue to the next step.

   If you signed in to an existing Azure DevOps organization, select the **New project** button to create a new project.

1. Enter the details of your new project:

   - **Project name**: Use a meaningful but short name. Here, you use `toy-website`.
   - **Visibility**: You can use Azure DevOps to create public and private repositories. Create a private repository, since your toy website's files should only be accessed by people inside your organization. You can grant access to others later.

   After you're done, your project configuration should look like the following:
