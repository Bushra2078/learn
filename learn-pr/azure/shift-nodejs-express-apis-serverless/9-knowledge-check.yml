  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "How would you change the route endpoint for a function in a folder named _vacations-get_ to `vacations`?"
      choices:
        - content: "The `route` property in the `bindings` array `req` object in the _function.json_ file"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  By convention, the `req` object will default the route to the same name as the folder that contains the function. When you want to override the name of the route, you can add a `route` property to the `req` object in the `bindings` array of the _function.json_."
        - content: "The `methods` property in the `bindings` array `req` object in the _function.json_ file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `methods` property defines which HTTP methods will be directed to the route."
        - content: "The `authLevel` property in the `bindings` array `req` object in the _function.json_ file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `authLevel` property defines the authorization level required to access the function."
        - content: "The `redirect` property in the `bindings` array `req` object in the _function.json_ file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There isn't redirect property in the `bindings` array `req` object."
    - content: "Where would you find the code in an Azure Functions Application that runs when an HTTP request is made?"
      choices:
        - content: "The _index.ts_ file in a function's folder"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  Each function is contained in a folder. Each function's folder contains an _index.ts_ file, which fires for its matching route."
        - content: "The _function.json_ file in a function's folder"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The _function.json_ file contains the function's configuration."
        - content: "The _host.json_ file in the Azure Functions application root"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The _host.json_ file contains configuration for the application, not a specific function."
        - content: "The _routes.ts_ file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There isn't a _routes.json_ file by default in an Azure Functions application."
    - content: "How do you access both the Request and Response of HTTP calls in Azure Functions?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use the `Context` parameter that is passed to each function."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  Each function is passed a `Context` object, which contains, among other properties, `req` and a `res` properties. `Context.req` and `Context.res` are the Request and Response of the HTTP call."
        - content: "Use the `HttpRequest` parameter that is passed to each function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `HttpRequest` parameter represents the HTTP Request, but it doesn't offer access to the Response."
        - content: "Use the `Request` and `Response` parameters that are passed to each function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The Request and Response aren't directly passed to a function."
        - content: "Use the async/await syntax to access the Request and Response."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The async/await syntax helps execute asynchronous code not the Request and Response."
