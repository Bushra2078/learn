Congratulations! You completed your Azure Functions application by shifting your Node.js Express code and making minimal changes. You took the following steps to refactor your code from Node.js Express to Functions:

1. Created the Functions application.
1. Copied the Node.js Express services from the _server/services_ folder to the _functions_ folder.
1. Imported the Functions host `Context` from `@azure/functions`.
1. Used destructuring to access the request and response objects.
1. Created a function for every route endpoint.
1. Named and set the method for each endpoint in the function's _function.json_ file.
1. Added code to each function's _index.tx_ file to call the appropriate service.

## Functions folders

The Functions application has folders that map to each of their endpoints, as shown in the following table:

| Method | Route endpoint | Folder          |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `GET`     | `vacations`     | *vacations-get*    |
| `POST`    | `vacations`     | *vacations-post*   |
| `PUT`     | `vacations:id`  | *vacations-put*    |
| `DELETE`  | `vacations/:id` | *vacations-delete* |

## File structure

The Functions application in the _functions_ folder should have the following file structure:

```files
functions
 | - vacations-delete
 | | - function.json
 | | - index.ts
 | - vacations-get
 | | - function.json      ðŸ‘ˆ The vacation route's configuration
 | | - index.ts           ðŸ‘ˆ The vacation routes
 | - vacations-post
 | | - function.json
 | | - index.ts
 | - vacations-put
 | | - function.json
 | | - index.ts
 | - services              ðŸ‘ˆ The same folder that the Express app has
 | | - data.ts             ðŸ‘ˆ The vacation data (could be database API calls)
 | | - index.ts
 | | - vacation.service.ts ðŸ‘ˆ The logic to get the vacation data
 | - .funcignore
 | - .gitignore
 | - host.json
 | - local.settings.json
 | - package.json
 | - proxies.json
 | - tsconfig.json
```

In the next unit, you run and debug your Angular application and Functions application together.
