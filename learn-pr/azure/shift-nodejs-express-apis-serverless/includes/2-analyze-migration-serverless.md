To demonstrate shifting a Node.js Express API to Azure Functions, this learning module uses the [Refactor Node.js Express to Azure Functions](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-module-shifting-nodejs-express-apis-to-serverless) sample project on GitHub. The client application is developed with Angular, but the same process works with Vue.js, React.js, or other frontend frameworks.

The following screenshot shows the Angular Vacation Wishlist app with a list of vacations.

The sample project initially builds a TypeScript Node.js Express application that interacts with the vacation wishlist. The goal of the learning module is to shift the project APIs to a Functions app and migrate the Express server to a serverless model. The finished application and its API feature all the benefits of serverless technology.
