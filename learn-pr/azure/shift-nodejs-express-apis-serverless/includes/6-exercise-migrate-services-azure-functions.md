In this unit, you create and configure functions in the Azure Functions app for the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints in the Node.js Express app.

## Create the GET function

This function executes when an HTTP `GET` is requested on `/vacations`. To create the new `GET` function:

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the command palette by pressing **F1**.
1. Type and select **Azure Functions: Create Function**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-create-function.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code creating a new function.":::

1. Choose **HTTP Trigger** as the type of function.
1. Enter *vacations-get* as the name of the function.
1. Select **Anonymous** as the authentication level.

The new function is created. The _functions/vacations-get_ folder has a _function.json_ file that contains the configuration for the function.

### Set the HTTP method and route endpoint


Make the following changes in the _functions/vacations-get/function.json_ file.

- Notice that the `req` methods list both `get` and `post`. Remove the `post` listing to allow only `get` requests.

- In the `bindings` section's `req` properties, add a `"route": "vacations"` entry.

  By default, the route endpoint has the same name as the folder that contains the function. Since the function is created in the _vacations-get_ folder, the route endpoint is generated as `vacations-get`. Adding the `"route": "vacations"` property to the function bindings makes the route match the expected `vacations` route from the Node.js Express app.

Your _function.json_ should look like the following code.

```json
{
  "disabled": false,
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": ["get"],
      "route": "vacations"
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ],
  "scriptFile": "../dist/vacations-get/index.js"
}
```

### Refactor the route

The other important file in the _functions/vacations-get_ folder is _index.ts_. This file contains the logic that runs when the route endpoint is requested.

When the Angular application makes an HTTP `GET` request to `vacations`, the route endpoint must get the vacations data. You refactor the route logic in your function to get vacations from the `getVacations` function in your service. The Node.js Express app already includes the logic that you move into this file.

Open the _functions/vacations-get/index.ts_ file, and replace the contents with the following code:

```typescript
import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from '@azure/functions';
import { vacationService } from '../services';

const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
  await vacationService.getVacations(context); // ðŸ‘ˆ This calls the vacation service
};

export default httpTrigger;
```

The code you eliminated was the default code that the Azure Functions extension generates. The code doesn't call the vacation service, so you can safely remove it. The code that you added calls the asynchronous function `vacationService.getVacations` and passes in the `context`, which contains the request and response objects.

## Create the remaining functions

There are four endpoints in the Node.js Express application, and you just created the function for the `GET` endpoint. Now create functions for the remaining route endpoints.

| Method | Route endpoint    |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `POST`    | `vacations-post`   |
| `PUT`     | `vacations-put`    |
| `DELETE`  | `vacations-delete` |

For each remaining endpoint, follow the same steps as for the `GET` endpoint to create the function.

### Create the HTTP POST function

Create the `POST` function that handles adding a vacation.

1. In Visual Studio Code, create the function with **HTTP Trigger** as the type, *vacations-post* as the name, and **Anonymous** as the authentication level.
1. In the new _vacations-post_ folder, open _function.json_ and set the method to `post`.
1. In the `bindings` section's `req` properties, add a `"route": "vacations"` entry.
1. Replace the contents of the _functions/vacations-post/index.ts_ file with the following code that calls the `vacationService.postVacation` function:

   ```typescript
   import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from '@azure/functions';
   import { vacationService } from '../services';
   
   const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
     await vacationService.postVacation(context);
   };
   
   export default httpTrigger;
   ```

### Create the HTTP PUT function

Create the `PUT` function to handle updating a vacation.

1. In Visual Studio Code, create the function with **HTTP Trigger** as the type, *vacations-put* as the name, and **Anonymous** as the authentication level.
1. In the new _vacations-put_ folder, open _function.json_ and set the method to `put`.
1. In the `bindings` section's `req` properties, add a `"route": "vacations/{id}"` entry.
1. Replace the contents of the _functions/vacations-put/index.ts_ file with the following code that calls the `vacationService.putVacation` function:

   ```typescript
   import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from '@azure/functions';
   import { vacationService } from '../services';
   
   const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
     await vacationService.putVacation(context);
   };
   
   export default httpTrigger;
   ```

### Create the HTTP DELETE function

Create the `DELETE` function to handle deleting a vacation.

1. In Visual Studio Code, create the function with **HTTP Trigger** as the type, *vacations-delete* as the name, and **Anonymous** as the authentication level.
1. In the new _vacations-delete_ folder, open _function.json_ and set the method to `delete`.
1. In the `bindings` section's `req` properties, add a `"route": "vacations/{id}"` entry.
1. Replace the contents of the _functions/vacations-delete/index.ts_ file with the following code that calls the `vacationService.deleteVacation` function:

   ```typescript
   import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from '@azure/functions';
   import { vacationService } from '../services';
   
   const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
     await vacationService.deleteVacation(context);
   };
   
   export default httpTrigger;
   ```

Go to the next unit to review the Azure Functions application you created.
