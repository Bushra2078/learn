In this unit, you get the existing application's code from GitHub, prepare the code, and set up your development environment.

## Get and prepare the code

1. In a bash terminal, clone the code repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-module-shifting-nodejs-express-apis-to-serverless learn-functions
   ```

1. Change to the code repository directory.

   ```bash
   cd learn-functions
   ```

1. Install the npm package dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Build the Node.js Express and Angular code.

   ```bash
   npm run full:build
   ```

## Understand application structure

The sample application is a conventional Node.js and Express API with four methods that serve the following endpoints:

| Method | Route endpoint |
| ------- | --------------- |
| `GET`     | `vacations`     |
| `POST`    | `vacations`     |
| `PUT`     | `vacations:id`  |
| `DELETE`  | `vacations/:id` |

Open the project in Visual Studio Code, and open the _server_ folder to explore the structure of the API.

```files
server
 | - routes
 | | - index.ts            ðŸ‘ˆ 1. Entry point
 | | - vacation.routes.ts  ðŸ‘ˆ 2. The vacation routes
 | - services
 | | - data.ts             ðŸ‘ˆ The vacation data (could be database API calls)
 | | - index.ts
 | | - vacation.service.ts ðŸ‘ˆ 3. The logic to get the vacation data
 | - index.ts
 | - server.ts             ðŸ‘ˆ The Express server
 | - tsconfig.json
```

1. The entry point is the _server/index.ts_ file, which runs the _server.ts_ code to start the Express server.
1. Then the routes, such as `/vacations`, are loaded from the _/routes_ folder.
1. The routes execute the appropriate code in the _/services_ folder.

   The data store configuration is defined in the _data.ts_ file.

For example, the Angular client app makes an `HTTP GET` request to the _routes/vacation.routes_ route, and the route executes the logic in the _/services/vacation.service.ts_ file to get the vacations.

### Proxy configuration

Open _proxy.conf.json_ and notice that the port is set to `7070`.

```json
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "http://localhost:7070",
    "secure": false
  }
}
```

The Node.js Express API runs on port `7070`, while the Angular application runs on port `4200`. The Angular application can't make requests across the domains to the Node.js Express application. Setting up a proxy enables the browser to locate the Express server.

## Set breakpoints

To display a list of vacations, the Angular application runs the `getVacations()` function in the _vacations.component.ts_ file, which calls the route in the _vacation.routes.ts_ file. Set breakpoints in these files, so during debugging you can step through the code that fetches the vacations.

>[!NOTE]
>The files _.vscode/launch.json_ and _.vscode/tasks.json_ are integral to the debugging experience for this project.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the application's _src/app/vacations/vacations.component.ts_ file, and locate the `getVacations()` function.
1. Set a breakpoint by selecting the editor's gutter to the left of the first line of code, `this.vacationService.getAll();`, inside the `getVacations()` function.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-first-breakpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the first breakpoint to set in Visual Studio Code.":::

1. Open _server/routes/vacation.routes.ts_ and locate the following code:

   ```typescript
   router.get('/vacations', (req, res) => {
     vacationService.getVacations(req, res);
   });
   ```

1. Set a breakpoint by selecting the editor's gutter to the left of the line of code `vacationService.getVacations(req, res);`.

## Run and debug the app

1. Open the Visual Studio Code command palette by pressing **F1**, and enter and select **View: Show Run and Debug**.
1. Select **Debug Express and Angular** from the dropdown list and then press **F5** to start the debugger.

   When the application launches, the Angular `VacationComponent` sends an HTTP request to get the vacation data for the list of vacations. When the browser opens, the code execution pauses on your first breakpoint in the _vacations.component.ts_ file for the `getVacations()` function.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-paused-execution.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code paused during execution.":::

1. Unpause execution and continue by pressing **F5**.

1. The code now pauses on your second breakpoint in the _vacation.routes.ts_ file, because the Angular application hits the Node.js Express route `vacations`. Unpause execution and continue by pressing **F5**.

1. There are two debugging processes running: one for Angular and one for Node.js Express. Press **SHIFT+F5** to stop the active debugger.

1. Press **SHIFT+F5** again to stop the remaining debugger.
