To plan the shift to serverless, you can break down the Node.js Express app into three main areas:

- The Express server, which is mostly in _server.ts_
- The routes, which are in the _routes/_ folder.
- The data access logic, which is in _services/vacation.service.ts_

To refactor your code from Node.js Express to Azure Functions, you follow these steps:

1. Create the Azure Functions application.
1. Copy Node.js Express services from the _server/services_ folder to the _functions_ folder.
1. Import the `Context` object from `@azure/functions`.
1. Use destructuring to access `Context.req` and `Context.res`.
1. Create a function for each route endpoint.
1. Name and set the method for each route endpoint in each function's _function.json_ file.
1. Add code to each function to call the appropriate service.

Over the next few exercises, you shift these areas one at a time. You start by shifting from the Express server to Azure Functions.
