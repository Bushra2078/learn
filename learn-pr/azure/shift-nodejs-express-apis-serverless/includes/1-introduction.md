Suppose your company has a vacation planning website that helps customers add, edit, view, and remove plans from their wish lists. Your API, which runs on Node.js and Express, powers these features. A server running Node.js and Express hosts your API and is critical to the success of the application. You must scale your application up and down as needed, while minimizing costs.

By shifting your API to a serverless model that uses Azure Functions, you can reduce the burdens of maintaining servers without rewriting your API. The serverless model scales your application up and down as needed, reduces costs, and requires writing less code.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you refactor an Express API to a serverless architecture by following these steps:

1. Explore and run the Node.js Express APIs in the sample project.
1. Create an Azure Functions application.
1. Refactor the Express routes and data calls to use the Azure Functions application.
1. Debug the serverless API by using Visual Studio Code.
