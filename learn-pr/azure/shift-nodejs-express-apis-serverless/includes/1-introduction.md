Suppose your company is launching a vacation planning website that helps customers add, edit, view, and remove plans from their wish list. Your API, which powers these features, runs on Node.js and Express is critical to the success of the application.

Your API server is critical to the success of the application. The APIs are hosted on a server running Node.js and Express. When you launch your application, it must scale up and down as needed while minimizing costs. There's a lot for you to think about!

What if you could reduce some of these burdens without rewriting your entire API? By shifting the API to a serverless model using Azure Functions, you enjoy the following benefits:

- No server to maintain
- Cost reductions
- Application scaling up and down as needed

Plus, you could write less code!

## Learning objectives

In this tutorial, you move from an Express API to a serverless architecture through the following steps:

1. You'll begin by exploring and running the Node.js and Express APIs in the sample project
1. Next, you'll create an Azure Functions application
1. Then, you'll refactor the Express routes and data calls to use the Azure Functions application
1. Finally, you'll learn how to debug a Serverless API using VS Code.
