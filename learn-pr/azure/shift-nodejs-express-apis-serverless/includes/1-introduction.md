As a software engineer at Tailwind Trader's, responsible for an application on your company's vacation planning website that helps customers add, edit, view, and remove plans on their vacation wish lists. Your API, which is hosted on a server running Node.js and Express, is critical to the success of the application. It's challenging to manage the server and scale the application up and down as needed while minimizing costs.

## Server-based applications

To reduce the burden of maintaining servers, you can migrate your application to a serverless model that scales up and down as needed, reduces costs, and requires less code. You can use Azure Functions to shift your API to a serverless model without having to rewrite your application.

To use your current Express application and server, you must:

- Write code that includes the necessary middleware and logic to start and run the server.
- Configure and maintain the physical server hardware and software.
- Manage scaling your application up and down as demand fluctuates.
- Manage the costs of deploying and running the server.

## Serverless applications

Moving the vacation planning application to a serverless architecture, such as Azure Functions, can offer several benefits. 

* Serverless architectures can significantly reduce the overhead of server management. Tasks like configuring and maintaining server hardware and software, managing server scaling based on demand, and handling the costs associated with server deployment and operation are no longer a concern. This allows the software engineering team to focus more on developing and improving the application's features rather than on infrastructure management. 

* Serverless architectures automatically scale up and down based on demand, ensuring the application can handle peak usage times without manual intervention. This can lead to cost savings, as you only pay for the compute time you actually use. 

* Transitioning to serverless does not necessarily require a complete rewrite of the application, making it a potentially efficient and cost-effective solution for enhancing the scalability and performance of the vacation planning application.
