In this module, you refactored your Node.js Express application to Azure Functions. Now you can think less about servers, because you're using serverless!

Node.js and Express are powerful solutions for serving API endpoints. With Functions, you can shift your APIs to serverless architecture and not worry about about server setup or maintenance.

You might also be able to reduce the cost of an always-on server and improve scalability by replacing the Node.js Express server with the Azure Functions app. Ultimately, with Functions you focus on the code, not the servers.

> [!NOTE]
> To deploy the Azure Functions app to the cloud, see the tutorial [Manage Azure resource groups with TypeScript Function API](/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-web-app/azure-function-resource-group-management/deploy-azure-function-with-visual-studio-code). You can use a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), and then use the Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code to deploy the application.

The solution for the current sample project is in the [solution branch](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-module-shifting-nodejs-express-apis-to-serverless/tree/solution) on GitHub. Follow the instructions in the README file to get started. You can explore running the Express app or the Azure Functions app to get a sense of the differences. Then try to apply this same shift to your code.
