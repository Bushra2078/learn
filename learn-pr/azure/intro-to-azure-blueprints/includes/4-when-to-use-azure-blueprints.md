## When to use Azure Blueprints

The overall recommendation about the usage of Azure Blueprints is for whenever you have a new project to be deployed needing to ensure the enforcement of minimal governance rules on it. With Azure Blueprints you will be able to build a blueprint which enables repeatable deployments, orchestration, security, control and empowerment to your teams.

Those blueprints will be like a package that you could integrate with your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to deliver governance as code.
