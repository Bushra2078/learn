Finding a way to have your cloud environment and deployments well defined, structured, and compliant with your business definitions is challenging. Here are some of the main topics you should consider:

* Composition: Compose, deploy, and update cloud environments in a repeatable manner
* Orchestration: Orchestrate deployment of resource templates, policies, and role based access controls
* Protection: Lock down foundational infrastructure that is shared across different subscriptions
* Empowerment: Let app teams use Azure in a self-service manner while ensuring organizational standards

How can you bring everything that has already been discussed, in a structured way, so that you can configure your environment in a consistent and automated way, at scale, in the shortest possible time?

For a developer, there is a lot to do when setting up an Azure subscription for the first time. As you might say, Azure is an empty canvas and if you are not an artist, there is a lot to draw. Trying to fill the screen with a base image is what Azure Blueprint really is about. The developer tries to create a fundamental foundation for the appearance of their environment.

There is no reason for your DevOps team to become a ninja on the Azure network, they just need to focus on their code, business logic, etc.

What happens today is that you provide the DevOps team, with a giant document containing all the required specifications and organize several meetings with them to make sure that they understand and follow those specifications. Another option is that you do everything for the team, which increases implementation time. The implementation time is increased due to alignment of other devops processes that are waiting for your environment to be provisioned.

Here are some of the main challenges for customers when designing and configuring the governance for their subscriptions:

* **Challenging to configure the basic infrastructure:** It becomes complex to create and redistribute the infrastructure.
* **Inability to create governed subscriptions:** Absence of a centralized way of defining and ensuring that what is created, or made available in a signature, will be applied. The client will need to use many scripts to accomplish this.
* **Protection of critical resources:** Subscription owners can modify resources and remove policies in violation of best practices defined by cloud architects. Therefore, to address these key challenges faced by customers, Azure Blueprints was created to provide you with an automated and easy-to-deploy solution to help set up Azure subscriptions inline with a governance strategy.

Azure Blueprints allow you to implement governance as code.
