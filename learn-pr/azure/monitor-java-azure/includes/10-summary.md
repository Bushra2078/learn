Congratulations! You've learned how to use monitoring to for your Java Azure Applications.

As an an infrastructure manager you were asked to monitor your Azure Java application and its dependencies.

To that end, you've done the following actions:

* Learnt about the different forms of Monitoring on Azure

* Build and deploy a Sample Microservices Application and configured it for Azure Application Performance Monitoring(APM).

* Monitored the application with Azure Application Insights.

You're now able to recommend this architecture for your Azure Java applications.

## Clean up your Azure resources

In the preceding processes, you created Azure resources. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete the resource group by running the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell:

```azurecli
az group delete --name <your Resource Group Name> --yes
```
