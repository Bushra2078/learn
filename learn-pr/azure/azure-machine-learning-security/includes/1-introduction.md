Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) and the Azure cloud services supporting it provide a complete security system that offers granular control of the network environment, resources used within it, and the data being accessed throughout. Machine Learning requires large quantities of data to train effective models. Some of this data can contain individual'sâ€™ or companies' sensitive information that must remain private. Security challenges surrounding Machine Learning are not just limited to data, and the setup of creating a secure work environment can be daunting.

Security concerns surrounding data and models within Machine Learning are perennial. Machine learning models are increasingly critical to businesses, and so security must be ensured. Most attacks on Machine Learning systems usually involve accessing models through insecure networks to steal data, or to manipulate it to affect model performance. By building more secure training sets,, locking down ML platforms, and controlling access to inputs and outputs, we can ensure data remains protected. Azure provides a number of security features for administrators, DevOps, and MLOps who want to create secure configurations compliant with their companies' policies.
