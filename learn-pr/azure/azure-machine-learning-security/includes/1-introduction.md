Machine learning requires large quantities of data to train effective models. Some of this data can contain individuals' or companies’ sensitive information that must be secured to remain private. Security challenges surrounding machine learning are not just limited to data, and the setup of creating a secure work environment can be daunting. Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) provides several mechanisms that offers granular control of the network environment, resources used within it, and the data being accessed.

Many attacks on machine learning systems involve accessing models through insecure networks to steal or manipulate data to affect model performance and access sensitive data. By building better, more secure training data stores, locking down machine learning platforms, and controlling access to inputs and outputs, we can ensure data remains protected. These features are useful for data scientists, administrators, and operations engineers who want to create secure configurations compliant with their companies’ policies.
