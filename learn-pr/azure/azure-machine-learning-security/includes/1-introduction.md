Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) and the Azure cloud services supporting it provide a complete security system that offers granular control of the network environment, resources used within it, and the data being accessed throughout. Machine Learning requires large quantities of data to train effective models. Some of this data can contain individual’s or companies’ sensitive information that must be secured to remain private. Security challenges surrounding Machine Learning are not just limited to data, and the setup of creating a secure work environment can be daunting.

Security concerns surrounding data and models within Machine Learning are a perennial one. The power of these systems to help predict maintenance schedules, spot fraud, and find important data points within noisy datasets means that its application within organizations is becoming increasingly critical. Most attacks on Machine Learning systems usually involve accessing models through insecure networks to steal or manipulate data to affect model performance and access sensitive data. By building better, more secure training sets, locking down ML platforms, and controlling access to inputs and outputs, we can ensure data remains protected. These features are useful for administrators, DevOps, and MLOps who want to create secure configurations compliant with their companies’ policies.
