In this module, you learned about Azure Machine Learning, a cognitive service available on Azure. You learned about the different types of forms that prebuilt models can analyze and extract data from, how Layout API can extract document structures, and how prebuilt models can extract data tailored specifically to your forms.

Now that you've reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Assess the benefits of Azure Machine Learning
* Describe what Azure Machine Learning is
* Define scenarios where Azure Machine Learning can be applied
