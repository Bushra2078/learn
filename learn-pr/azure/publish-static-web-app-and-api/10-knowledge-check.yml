  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "How would you change the route endpoint for a function in a folder named _vacations-get_ to `vacations`?"
      choices:
        - content: "The `route` property in the `bindings` array `req` object in the _function.json_ file"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  By convention, the `req` object will default the route to the same name as the folder that contains the function. When you want to override the name of the route, you can add a `route` property to the `req` object in the `bindings` array of the _function.json_."
        - content: "The `methods` property in the `bindings` array `req` object in the _function.json_ file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `methods` property defines which HTTP methods will be directed to the route."
        - content: "The `authLevel` property in the `bindings` array `req` object in the _function.json_ file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `authLevel` property defines the authorization level required to access the function."
        - content: "The `redirect` property in the `bindings` array `req` object in the _function.json_ file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There isn't redirect property in the `bindings` array `req` object."
