As your needs grow and change, you might implement additional instances of Azure Firewall, each with similar rules that govern traffic flow. With more complex virtual network, virtual WAN, and firewall settings, things can get harder to manage. 

In this module, you learned that you can use Azure Firewall Manager to manage your cloud-based security perimeters. You also learned that Azure Firewall Manager centrally manages your Firewall policies, virtual networks, and virtual WANs. 

You learned that Azure Firewall Manager enables you to reconfigure these various components to suit your organizational needs as these needs change. Consider using Azure Firewall Manager when:

- You have multiple Azure Firewalls you want to manage centrally
- You want to assign matching settings to many firewalls
