Our goal was to help you decide if Firewall Manager is a good choice for your company's firewall and security requirements. We developed the following criteria to help guide your decision:

- Complexity
- Need for centralized management
- Number of virtual networks

We applied these criteria to your fictional company. You determined that as your needs grow and change, you have the option of implementing additional instances of Azure Firewall, each with similar rules that govern traffic flow. However, managing a complex virtual network, virtual WAN, and firewall settings is more complicated.

Our criteria helped you evaluate whether your company requires Firewall Manager. The criteria evaluate the complexity of your virtual network structure, the number of virtual networks you need to manage, and your need for centralized management. You now have enough information to determine whether Firewall Manager would be a good fit for your company's growing requirements for virtual networks and firewalls.

You learned that you can use Azure Firewall Manager to manage your cloud-based security perimeters. You also learned that Azure Firewall Manager centrally manages your Firewall policies, virtual networks, and virtual WANs and enables you to reconfigure these components to suit changes in your organizational needs. Consider using Firewall Manager when:

- You have multiple Azure Firewalls you want to manage centrally.
- You want to assign matching settings to many firewalls.
- You want to integrate with third-party security partners.
