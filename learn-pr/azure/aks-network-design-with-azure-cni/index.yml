  title: Design an Azure Kubernetes Service network with Azure CNI
  description: In this module, we'll take a detailed look at the process of designing an Azure Kubernetes Service network using the Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) plug-in. We'll cover some Kubernetes networking basics looking at how certain resource types use IP addresses. Then we'll use a fictional application to see how to size a Kubernetes cluster and in turn, determine the requirements for the network. To finish, we'll walk through the process of deploying an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster and will view details of the network configuration.
