In this module, you've learned how you can use the Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) feature in Azure Active Directory to enable users to recover when they've forgotten their passwords. This password reset doesn't require an administrator to be involved. It is secured by authentication methods of your choice, which can include a mobile authentication app, a code sent to you by an SMS text message, or security questions. 

SSPR reduces the amount of work required from administrators and prevents any impact on the productivity of users when they forget their passwords.
