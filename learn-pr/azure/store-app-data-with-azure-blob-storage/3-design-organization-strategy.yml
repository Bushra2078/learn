  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you need to store structured data that will be queried often. True or false: blob storage is a good choice for storing structured data?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Blobs are not appropriate for structured data that needs to be queried frequently. They have higher latency than memory and local disk and don't have the indexing features that make databases efficient at running queries."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Blobs are not appropriate for structured data that needs to be queried frequently. They have higher latency than memory and local disk and don't have the indexing features that make databases efficient at running queries."

  - content: Blobs provide *unstructured* data storage. What does *unstructured* mean?
    choices:
    - content: "Blobs can't be organized or named, they are only collections of bytes."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Blobs do not impose any structure on your data, meaning your application can store any type of data in a blob."
    - content: "There are no restrictions on the type of data you can store in blobs."
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Blobs do not impose any structure on your data, meaning your application can store any type of data in a blob."
    - content: "Blobs can't contain structured data, like JSON or XML."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Blobs do not impose any structure on your data, meaning your application can store any type of data in a blob."
    - content: "Data downloaded from blobs is organized randomly and requires a client library to parse it."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Blobs do not impose any structure on your data, meaning your application can store any type of data in a blob."
