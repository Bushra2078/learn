<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly orient the learner to the product; what category of problem does it solve?

    Heading: none

    Example: "Implementing a business process can be challenging because you typically need to make diverse services work together. Think about everything your company uses to store and process data: Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Oracle, Twitter, YouTube, Dropbox, Google services, Azure Cognitive Services, and so on. How do you integrate all these products? Azure Logic Apps gives you pre-built components to connect to hundreds of services. You use a graphical design tool to put the pieces together in any combination you need and Logic Apps will run your process automatically in the cloud."

    Recommended: visual like an image (preferred), table, list, etc.

Implementing business process automation across a set of Microsoft 365 services can be challenging if the right tool isn't available. Think about all repetitive bulk administrative tasks your company needs to do: user/guest lifecycle management, App management, Exchange, Sharepoint. How do you automate tasks across all these services? Microsoft Graph PowerShell exposes the entire Microsoft Graph API set for use in PowerShell providing a powerful way to optimize your work flow.


<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the real-world scenario you'll use to illustrate the product. Include 2-3 customer tasks that represent the most-common use cases for the product.

    Heading: "## Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company that is launching a new product. You sell the shoes on your website, manage your cloud-hosted advertising videos, and monitor social media to gauge reactions to the launch. The following illustration shows these processes. Notice how the tasks include both customer-facing processes like direct sales and administrative tasks like auto-archiving old videos. Here, you'll see how Logic Apps automates these types of business processes."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario

## Example scenario

Suppose you're the IT admin of a vendor company that develops software solutions. Your organization is using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and other Microsoft 365 services. You maintain a database of all devices registered in Azure AD. Due to loss, broken devices or OS reinstallations, you've stale devices in your environment. You've been tasked with finding the best tool to find and remove stale devices, so you can focus your resources on managing devices that actually require management. With your knowledge of PowerShell, you would like to know if Microsoft Graph PowerShell would be the most appropriate tool to automate this process.

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do. This differs from the learning objectives. The learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Weâ€™ll analyze the capabilities of Logic Apps to help you decide when to use them:
                * **Launch**: what conditions can you set to launch your app?
                * **Connect**: which services can you connect to?
                * **Branch**: what types of business logic can you add to your app?"

 -->
## What will we be doing?

Microsoft Graph PowerShell is PowerShell for the entire Microsoft Graph API and provides PowerShell command for all REST APIs in Microsoft Graph. We'll look at the features and benefits of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module and how to use the module to automate different business processes.

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: The title of an "Introduction to (product)" module tells our customers that this is a good place to start their learning. This helps our customers find the right content quickly. The trade-off is that the title does not reflect the terminal learning objective of the module. Here, you explain that this module teaches the 'evaluate' task. To do this, you:
        - Start with your 'evaluate' learning objective
        - Make it a complete sentence if it's not already
        - Use plain language so it sounds conversational
        - Include the lead-in shown below ("By the end...")

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to decide whether Logic Apps is a good choice to automate your business processes."

 -->
## What is the main goal?
By the end of this session, you'll be able to determine if Microsoft Graph PowerShell possesses the capabilities required to automate your business processes.

<!-- Do **not** include any other content like learning objectives, prerequisites, unit summary, "next unit" lead-in, or references. -->
