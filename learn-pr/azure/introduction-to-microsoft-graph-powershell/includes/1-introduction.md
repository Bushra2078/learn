You've been tasked with finding the best tool to find and remove stale devices, so you can focus your resources on managing devices that actually require management. With your knowledge of PowerShell, you would like to know if Microsoft Graph PowerShell would be the most appropriate tool to automate this process. Below is a screenshot of the devices listing from the azure portal.
