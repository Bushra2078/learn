Microsoft Graph PowerShell wouldn't exist without Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is a gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It offers a single endpoint, `https://graph.microsoft.com`, to access rich, people-centric data and insights in the Microsoft cloud. The data and insights include Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security through REST APIs.
  
Microsoft Graph PowerShell is a Software Development Kit (SDK) that acts as an API wrapper for the Microsoft Graph APIs, exposing the entire API set for use in PowerShell. It contains cmdlets for all the Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets and the reference documentation are autogenerated from the Microsoft Graph REST APIs.

## Packaging

Microsoft Graph PowerShell is packaged as the **Microsoft.Graph** module in PowerShell gallery as the root module, with multiple child modules. **Microsoft.Graph** acts as a container for the other modules.

Microsoft.Graph.Authentication is the core module, which contains the following components:

- `Connect-MgGraph`: to sign in to Microsoft Graph
- `Invoke-MgGraphRequest`: to issue REST API requests for the Microsoft Graph API
- Commands to switch between **beta** and **V1.0** versions of the SDK
- Commands to discover permissions and API-specific Graph commands in other modules

Other modules are made up of thousands of commands.

Commands are named like **{Verb}**-Mg **{Resource}** (a Graph API resource) for example, user,group, and application. For example, in the command `Get-MgUser`, **get** is the verb and **user** the resource.

## Microsoft Graph PowerShell features & benefits

Microsoft Graph PowerShell has the following features and benefits:

- **Access to all Microsoft Graph APIs**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK  is based on Microsoft Graph API. The Microsoft Graph API includes, in addition to Azure AD, APIs from other Microsoft services like SharePoint, Exchange, and Outlook, all accessed through a single endpoint with a single access token.
- **Supports PowerShell 7**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell module works with PowerShell 7 and later. It's also compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- **Cross-platform support**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell module works on all platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Supports modern authentication**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell supports the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) that offers more security. For example, you can use Password-less sign-in experiences.
- **Open source**: Feature teams and the community can create great PowerShell experiences and share them with everyone.
- **Uses least privilege**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell doesn't support pre-authorization and common scenarios will require consent. You'll need to request for scopes for your current needs.
