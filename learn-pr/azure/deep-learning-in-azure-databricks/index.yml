title: Deep learning in Azure Databricks
summary: In this module, you will investigate techniques for developing machine learning models based on neural nets. The main purpose of this module is to build some intuition and understanding for what deep learning is all about.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Identify how neural networks work and use cases for deep learning algorighms.
  - Train and evaluate a simple classifier built using Tensorflow. 
  - Create an image classifier using deep learning. 
prerequisites: | 
  - Azure Subscription. 
  - If you are a Visual Studio Active subscriber, you are entitled for a $50-$150 credit per month. You can refer to this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) to find out more including how to activate and start using your monthly Azure credit.
  - If you are not a Visual Studio subscriber, you can sign up for the FREE [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/) program to create Azure free account (includes 1 year of free services, $200 for 1st month).
