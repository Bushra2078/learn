Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses algorithms based on the structure and functions of the human brain.  These algorithms are called artificial neural networks and they learn from large amounts of data. The artificial neural networks include several deep layers that enable learning to solve a problem that might require human brain like thought process. 

Deep learning techniques have the following advantages:
- **Accuracy**. Deep neural networks produce highly accurate results in some of the most complex situations such as image classifications.
- **Scalability**. Deep learning methods work efficiently on large volume of data and can be easily scaled based on the data set.
- **Robust**. The neural networks can work directly on a data set without requiring any sort of cleaning or engineering on the data feature.
- **Adaptability**. Pre-trained deep networks can be easily transferred and used with varied domains.
