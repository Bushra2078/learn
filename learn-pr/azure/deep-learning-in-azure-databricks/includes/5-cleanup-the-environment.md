In this unit, you will cleanup any Azure resources used by the lab so that you do not incur any unexpected Azure costs.

If you plan on completing other Azure Databricks modules, do not delete your Azure Databricks instance just yet. You will be able to use the same environment for the other modules.

## Delete the Azure Databricks instance

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal.
1. Navigate to the Resource Group that contains your Azure Databricks instance. 
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Type the name of the resource group in the confirmation text box.
1. Select **Delete**.
