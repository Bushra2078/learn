  title: 'Deep Learning Quiz'
  questions:
    - content: 'Which library can you use to achieve parallelized deep learning in Azure Databricks'
      choices:
        - content: Spark Deep Learning
          explanation: Spark Deep Learning supports parallelized deep learning in Spark and Azure Databricks. 
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Tensorflow
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Tensorflow on its own does not support parallelized deep learning in Azure Databricks.
          content: TFLearn
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: TFLearn does not support parallelized deep learning in Azure Databricks.
    - content: 'When dealing with images, which of the following techniques might be used?'
      choices:
        - content: Convolution
          explanation: Convolution is a mathematical technique often used by artificial neurons in a network to process image data.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Lemmatization
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Lemmatization is used in text pre-processing, not for images.
    - content: 'Which of these best describes the function of an auto-encoder neural network architecture?'
      choices:
        - content: A network that encodes the image into a compressed feature vector and then re-creates the image from the vector.
          explanation: This is the best description of an auto-encoder.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: A network that automatically encodes image data into a vector.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is an incomplete definition of an auto-encoder.
        - content: A network that automatically decodes a vector into image data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is an incomplete definition of an auto-encoder.
