Deploy a data technology stack that provides data governance, data quality, data lineage, data enrichment, and data standardization layers to your Azure ecosystem. Combine the power of Microsoft Purview, Azure Data Factory, and CluedIn into a powerhouse of data governance and data quality. This data pipeline takes raw data and surfaces high quality and ready-for-insight data to downstream systems and users.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Set up automated scans of Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) into Microsoft Purview.
- Set up automated data pipelines from Azure Data Factory to CluedIn through assets registered in Microsoft Purview.
- Stream data from CluedIn to ADLS Gen2.
- Standardize, clean, deduplicate, and enrich your data in CluedIn.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, you can follow [this link to create a free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Ability to navigate the Azure portal.
- Familiarity with Azure Data Factory.
- Familiarity with high-level concepts of Microsoft Purview.

## Scenario

Suppose you work for a large B2B consumer goods company and you want to provide your employees with a self-service way to use, discover, and build insights from data that's scattered across the operational systems in your business. By now you've probably amassed numerous legacy systems, but the data inside is still rich with opportunity. Your job is to make sure you're surfacing this data, and the data from all systems, in a way that abstracts away the complexity and promotes the open and creative use of this data. Both to solve day to day and long-term strategic pieces of the company goals and KPIs.

In this module, you'll create and deploy a data technology stack where we'll be able to share high quality data, with the required services around it, to drive downstream systems with data that will be ready to generate insights.

You'll be working with the following technology stack:

 - ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) Gen2
 - Microsoft Purview
 - CluedIn
 - Azure Data Factory

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build a recommended data management landing zone, as described in the Azure Common Fundamentals Framework that encapsulates data governance, master data management, data quality, and data integration.
