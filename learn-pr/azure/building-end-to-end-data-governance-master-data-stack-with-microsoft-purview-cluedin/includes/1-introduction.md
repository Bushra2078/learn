Microsoft Azure provides us with the ability to compose many difference native Azure Services into an end to end data estate. As part of this, we need to provide technical solutions to the different pillars of data management that allow us to provide our businesses and customers with easy to access, high quality, compliant data that is ready for insight. 

We have great existing services within the Azure ecosystem for storing, processing and generating insights from a large amount and high velocity of data. A critical part of this pipeline of data is that we are serving up data to the business and our customers with a high level of operational usability and readiness. This requires that we make this data discoverable, easy to access - but also we have made the data easy to work with and at a level of quailty and governance that makes the end users feel more than comfortable in utilising this data for their downstream insights and innovation. 

Suppose you work for a large B2B consumer goods company and you are wanting to provide your own employees with a self-service way to utilse, discover and build insights out of the data that is scattered across the different operational systems in your business. By now you have probably amassed a lot of legacy systems, but the data inside of it is still rich with opportunity. Our job it to make sure we are surfacing this data, and the data from all non-legacy systems in a way that abstracts away the complexity and promotes the open and creative use of this data to solve day to day, but long-term strategic pieces of the company goals and KPI's. 

Throughout this module and the associated learning path, you'll follow a scenario and be provided with a hands-on sandbox as to simulate the aforementioned technology stack. There's a complete learning path dedicated to exploring each piece of the architecture below. In this module, you'll create and deploy a data technology stack where we will be able to share high quality data, with the required services around it, to drive downstream systems with data that will be ready to generate insights in an accelerate fashion. 

You will have the option to use your language of choice (.net, Python, Node.js) as well as work with the following technology stack:

 - ADLSv2
 - Microsoft Purview
 - Azure Event Hub
 - Azure Functions
 - CluedIn

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build a recommended data management landing zone, as described in the Azure Common Fundamentals Framework that encapsulates Data Governance, Master Data Management, Data Quality and Data Integration.
