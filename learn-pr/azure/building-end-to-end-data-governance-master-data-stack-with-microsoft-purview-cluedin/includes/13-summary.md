Delivering high quality data throughout the business is no small feat, but once attained is an extremely lucrative and powerful enabler. Although this module is short, it does highlight that setting up an agile data pipeline is something that is rather quick to achieve, especially getting quick and valuable wins in increasing data quality, data goverance and trust in data. It also highlights that the flexible modelling experience of CluedIn allows agility and not having to find that perfect model for your data before data can start to flow. 

CluedIn and Purview are predominantly tasked with allowing business users to play a role in the data technology stack, but as you can see, this doesn't mean that IT cannot play a role in CluedIn and Purview as well. I would argue that anything that can be automated on data should be done through platforms like Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse, but there are aspects of data that cannot be automatically addressed due to many reasons. CluedIn is very much targetted at filling that gap. To that point, even though CluedIn supports applying code to the data running on the CluedIn pipeline, it doesn't mean it will be the best place to apply those transformations. This learning module aimed to highlight the parts of the data journey that require a human or augmented touch, but as you can clearly see, these can be actioned in a way that can turn into full automation without the need for code in the first place. 

Master Data is no longer a big, scary and long-winded project, but rather an agile, quick-win approach to applying a level of business-level governance and management over the data. CluedIn natively integrates with many of the Azure services, in fact, it uses many Azure services to natively run it as well. You may be asking yourself, "Could I do this all in Azure Data Factory / Azure Synapse / Azure Data Bricks?" Yes, you could, but the time and effort and cost for doing this will very quickly show that it should not be done in those platforms. In fact, there will be less code to manage and update, and with the type of data cleaning that is typically done in CluedIn, you would need to update the code on almost an hourly basis to cater for all the flux in data quality issues. CluedIn is a Azure cloud-native solution, meaning that it scales in the cloud in a horizontal fashion. Dependant upon your requirements and SLA's, CluedIn can easily scale to process 1000's of records a second at efficient cloud costs.
