Power Apps are organizational-specific applications or tools that allow you to create custom applications using many features, including a data platform that provides a flexible development environment to build custom apps for your business. Applications built with Power Apps offer great business logic to transform your manual business functions into automated processes. Also, these applications can be accessed via mobile devices or the browser, enabling users to create custom apps without writing code.

Power Apps provides an extensible platform for users with minimal coding experience to develop applications with rich business logic. In addition, pro developers find interacting with data and metadata easy while using Power Apps.

Through Power Apps, you can create canvas applications and model-driven applications.

* **Canvas apps**: Microsoft Power Apps allows you to build business apps from a canvas with minimal coding. Creating a canvas app in Power Apps is as easy as dragging and dropping components onto the canvas, just as designing a PowerPoint presentation. You can also integrate business logic through various data sources.

* **Model-driven apps**: In scenarios where you don't need a custom application, you can automatically generate model-driven apps from the data and processes stored in [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro). You can model forms, views, and other components. The default UI adjusts to phones, laptops, and other devices automatically. Unlike canvas app development, where the user has complete control over the app layout, in model-driven apps, the layout is determined for you and primarily designated by the components you add to the app.

Technology has paved the way and made our lives easier, faster, and better in this modern era of living. More or less, everything is automated to meet the rising demands of the people. One such budding area is "Sales." You wish to build an application that enables the users to virtually view various products in the comfort of their home before actually buying them. By doing so, the users can understand the risks and constraints of the products before committing to them.

In this module, you'll learn to create, build, and design customized application *Easy-Sales* that work across the web and mobile. *Easy-Sales* is a sales-oriented application that allows users to visualize a range of furniture in the real world using Mixed Reality components of Power Apps.
In addition, you'll learn how to connect a data source to Power Apps. You'll use Mixed Reality components like Measure in MR and View in MR in your application. Finally, you'll be equipped with all the tools and techniques required to develop a proper application.
