In this module, you learned how to design and develop an application in a short period of time and without the need for any coding. Users with any level of knowledge can use the apps for business purposes. By using the Microsoft Cloud and services like Dynamics 365, Power Apps enables you to access work across the Web and mobile without the time and expense of custom software development.

## Next steps

The application you built is basic, but you can extend it with more Power Apps features to unlock new scenarios for your business. Consider trying the following features:

* Use different **Connectors**.
* Add functionality that lets the user order more than one product.
* Incorporate **View shape in MR**.
