Imagine a scenario where a local salon has a problem that some of their customers commonly miss their appointment. They're disappointed because appointments are reserved time slots. If a customer misses their appointment, they lose money. They want to fix this problem, so they reach out to you, a software developer. After working together, you and the salon agree that a good way to fix this problem is by sending reminder text messages. Every morning you'll send a text message to every customer with an appointment that day.

You decide that the best way to develop this solution is to create an Azure Function. You already know how to implement the logic to send a text message, however, you now need to figure out a way to send it at a specific time. Luckily, Azure Functions supports a feature called triggers, which are used to determine how an Azure Function is executed.

## Learning Objectives

- Determine which trigger will work best for your business needs.
- Create a timer trigger that invokes a function on a consistent schedule.
- Create an HTTP trigger that invokes a function when receiving an HTTP request.
- Create a blob trigger that invokes a function when a blob is created or updated in Azure Storage.
