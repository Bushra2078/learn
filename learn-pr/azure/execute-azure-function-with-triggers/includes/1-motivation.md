Imagine a scenario where a local salon has discovered a problem that some of their clients commonly miss their appointment. The salon is disappointed because appointments are reserved time slots and if there is a no-show, theyâ€™re losing money. The salon wants to fix this problem, so they reach out to you,a software developer. After working together, you and the salon agree that a good way to fix this problem is to send out a reminder text message every morning to the clients with appointments that day.

You decide that the best way to develop this solution is to use Azure Functions because a serverless architecture has the most advantages. You already know how to implement the logic to send a text message, however, you now need to figure out a way to send it at a specific time. Luckily, Azure Functions supports a feature called triggers which are used to determine how an Azure Function is executed.

## Learning Objectives

- Determine which trigger will work best for your business needs.
- Create a timer trigger that invokes a function on a consistent schedule.
- Create a HTTP trigger that invokes a function when receiving an HTTP request.
- Create a blog trigger that invokes a function when a blob is created or update in Azure Storage.
