Imagine a scenario where a busy hair salon has a recurring problem; their customers commonly miss their appointments. The appointments are reserved time slots and if a customer misses an appointment, the salon loses money. To fix this problem, they reach out to you, a software developer. To improve the problem, you decide to send reminder text messages; every morning you'll send a text message to every customer with an appointment that day.

An an Azure developer, you decide to solve this problem using an Azure Functions. You already know how to implement the logic to send a text message, however, you now need to learn how to send it at a specific time. Luckily, Azure Functions supports a feature called triggers, which are used to determine how an Azure Function is executed.

## Learning Objectives

- Determine which trigger will work best for your business needs
- Create a timer trigger that invokes a function on a consistent schedule
- Create an HTTP trigger that invokes a function when receiving an HTTP request
- Create a blob trigger that invokes a function when a blob is created or updated in Azure Storage
