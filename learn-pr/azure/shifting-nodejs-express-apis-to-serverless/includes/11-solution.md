### Looking at the Functions App

The Azure Functions app now has folders that map to their appropriate endpoints as shown below.

| method | route endpoint | folder          |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| GET    | heroes         | heroes-get      |
| POST   | heroes         | heroes-post     |
| PUT    | heroes:id      | heroes-put      |
| DELETE | heroes/:id     | heroes-delete   |
| GET    | villains       | villains-get    |
| POST   | villains       | villains-post   |
| PUT    | villains:id    | villains-put    |
| DELETE | villains/:id   | villains-delete |

The structure of the Azure Function app contained in the _functions_ folder should look like the following.

```text

 | - heroes-delete
 | | - function.json
 | | - index.ts
