A great place for you to start is get your existing application's code out of GitHub.

Let's start by getting the code and setting up the development environment. Follow these steps to prepare the code.

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-module-shifting-nodejs-express-apis-to-serverless learn-functions
   cd learn-functions
   ```

1. Install the npm packages

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Build the Node Express and the Angular code

   ```bash
   npm run node-ng:build
   ```

You've gathered your code to your local computer, installed it's dependencies, and compiled your application. Before you run it, you're probably wondering how the application is structured. Let's explore that next.
