A great place for you to start is to get your existing application's code out of GitHub.

Let's start by getting the code and setting up your development environment. Follow these steps to prepare the code.

1. Clone the code repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-module-shifting-nodejs-express-apis-to-serverless learn-functions
   cd learn-functions
   ```

1. Install the npm package dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Build the Node.js Express and the Angular code

   ```bash
   npm run full:build
   ```

Is it time to run the code yet? Not quite. You've gathered your code to your local computer, installed its dependencies, and compiled your application. Before you run it, you're probably wondering how the application is structured. Let's explore that next.

Next, we'll explore the application's structure and code.
