Now it's time for you to plan the shift to serverless. The Node.js Express app can be broken down into its three main areas:

1. The Express server, which is mostly in _server.ts_
1. The routes, which are in _routes/_
1. The data access logic, which is in _services/vacation.service.ts_

Over the next few exercises, you'll take each one of these areas, one at a time, as you make the shift. Start with shifting from the Express server to Azure Functions.
