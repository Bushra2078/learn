title: Scale from a single node to multiple nodes with Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL
summary: "Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL can scale from a single-node, non-distributed cluster to a multi-node, distributed cluster with minimal downtime. When starting out with small amounts of data, it makes sense to start with a single node. However, as time goes on, data needs to scale for growth. By understanding the process of going from a single-node cluster to a multi-node cluster, you will be able to take advantage of growing your data with Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL."
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
    - "Create a single node instance of Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL"
