quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which nodes can host shards in a distributed configuration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Both coordinator and worker nodes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When going from single-node to multi-node, the coordinator node is configured host shards."
    - content: "Only the coordinator node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The coordinator node engages all nodes with shards in a query."
    - content: "Only the worker nodes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The worker nodes host shards all the time. There is another node that hosts shards in the single-node to multi-node configuration."
  - content: "Which of these shows the number of shards involved in a query?"
    choices:
    - content: "EXPLAIN in psql"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! EXPLAIN shows the query plan, including the number of tasks. The number of tasks represents the number of shards to be queried."
    - content: "pgbench"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. pgbench is a tool used for benchmarking queries. It does not get into the query plan."
    - content: "pg_cron"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. pg_cron is an extension used to schedule jobs in Postgres, including Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL."
  - content: "Which of these scenarios is incompatible for foreign keys in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "From reference tables to distributed tables"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! In order for foreign keys to be enforced, the referencing and referenced rows need to be stored on the same node. Going from a reference table to a distributed table that spans multiple nodes is not supported."
    - content: "Between reference tables and local tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL does support enforcing foreign keys between reference tables and local tables."
    - content: "From a distributed table to a reference table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL does support enforcing foreign keys starting a distributed table and going to a reference table. The data integrity is enforceable since each worker node has its own copy of a reference table."
