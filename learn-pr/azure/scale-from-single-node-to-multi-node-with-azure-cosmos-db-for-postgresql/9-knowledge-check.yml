quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which nodes can host shards in a distributed configuration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Both the coordinator node and the worker nodes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When going from single-node to multi-node, the coordinator node is configured to host shards."
    - content: "Only the coordinator node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The coordinator node engages all nodes that have shards in a query."
    - content: "Only the worker nodes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The worker nodes host shards all the time. There's another node that hosts shards in the single-node to multi-node configuration."
  - content: "Which of the following options show the number of shards that are involved in a query?"
    choices:
    - content: "`EXPLAIN` in psql"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! `EXPLAIN` shows the query plan, including the number of tasks. The number of tasks represents the number of shards to be queried."
    - content: "pgbench"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. pgbench is a tool that's used for benchmarking queries. It doesn't get into the query plan."
    - content: "pg_cron"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. pg_cron is an extension that's used to schedule jobs in PostgreSQL, including Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL."
  - content: "Which of these scenarios is incompatible for foreign keys in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "From reference tables to distributed tables"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! For foreign keys to be enforced, the referencing and referenced rows must be stored on the same node. Going from a reference table to a distributed table that spans multiple nodes isn't supported."
    - content: "Between reference tables and local tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL does support enforcing foreign keys between reference tables and local tables."
    - content: "From a distributed table to a reference table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL does support enforcing foreign keys that start in a distributed table and move to a reference table. The data integrity is enforceable because each worker node has its own copy of a reference table."
