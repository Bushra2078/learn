GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.

Azure Pipelines is a similar service that automatically builds and tests code projects to make them available to others. It works with just about any language or project type and could be used in place of GitHub Actions in this solution if desired.

## Brief review of CI/CD

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice used by development teams to automate the merging and testing of code. Implementing CI helps to catch bugs early in the development cycle, which makes them less expensive to fix. Automated tests execute as part of the CI process to ensure quality. Artifacts are produced from CI systems and fed to release processes to drive frequent deployments. The Build service in TFS helps you set up and manage CI for your applications.

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a process by which code is built, tested, and deployed to one or more test and production environments. Deploying and testing in multiple environments drives quality. CI systems produce the deployable artifacts including infrastructure and apps. Automated release processes consume these artifacts to release new versions and fixes to existing systems.

## CI/CD and catching the bus

In the catching the bus example, there are three key services using GitHub Actions: Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, and Azure Static Web Apps. Let's review how each of these work in the scenario.

### Azure SQL Database

There is a specific GitHub Action available through Azure called the **SQL Action**. This action was created to work with Azure SQL services. Let's review how the main part of the workflow (YAML) file is constructed. As an example, let's use the catch the bus sample.

Below you are looking at the job within the workflow file. When a push happens or a pull request is merged, this job will run. The workflow uses `Azure/sql-action@v1` which does most of the heavy lifting. You just have to provide the items under `with`: the server name, the connection string (stored as a secret in the repository), and the location of the .dacpac file. A .dacpac file contains the necessary database schema that is required. The action will incrementally update the database schema to match the schema of the source .dacpac file.

```yml
  deploy_database_job:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action != 'closed')
    runs-on: windows-latest
    name: Deploy Database Job
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: Azure/sql-action@v1
        with:
          server-name: bus-server.database.windows.net
          connection-string: ${{â€¯secrets.AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING }}
          # uses dacpac to deploy database schema
          dacpac-package: './Database/dacpac/bus-db.dacpac'
```

### Azure Functions

Connecting to Azure Functions from GitHub Actions is not difficult. The documentation provides several sample snippets depending on the language you want to use, and then you fill it in. Just like a connection string for Azure SQL is required, you have to include your function's *Publish Profile* which specifies how to connect to Azure Functions. Additionally, just like you had to specify the 'code' for your database's schema, you also have to specify where in your repository the code is located. Finally, depending on the language, you'll need to specify the version (for example, `NODE_VERSION: '14.x'`).

### Azure Static Web Apps

During the deployment of the Azure Static Web App in the previous exercise, you connected your service with GitHub by providing the repository and a GitHub token. Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Actions are tightly integrated, so the deployment takes care of creating the workflow file.

A typically Azure Static Web Apps workflow file contains two jobs: `build_and_deploy_job` and `close_pull_request_job`. The first job uses the `upload` action to build and deploy the code in the repository. The second job uses the `close` action to close out the pull request and deployment.

By default, the following code makes up the first job. Regardless of how you deploy, the secrets will be created during deployment. Post deployment, you may need to update the `app_location` and `api_location` to match where those pieces are located in your repository.

```yml
      - name: Build And Deploy
        id: builddeploy
        uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v0.0.1-preview
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Used for Github integrations (i.e. PR comments)
          action: "upload"
          ###### Repository/Build Configurations - These values can be configured to match you app requirements. ######
          # For more information regarding Static Web App workflow configurations, please visit: https://aka.ms/swaworkflowconfig
          app_location: "." # App source code path
          api_location: "." # Api source code path - optional
          output_location: "dist" # Built app content directory - optional
          ###### End of Repository/Build Configurations ######
```

The second job, `close_pull_reques_job`, simply calls the `close` action and there are no changes necessary.
