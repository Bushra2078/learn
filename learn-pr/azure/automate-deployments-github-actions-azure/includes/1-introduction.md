Building serverless, full-stack applications are greatly simplified in Azure due to the number of serverless services and the integrations that exist between them. Doing all this with CI/CD in mind is easy with the support and integration of GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.

GitHub Actions make adhering to continuous integration and continuous deployment principles easy to implement.

Getting the timing right of heading to the bus stop is a challenge that most can relate to. More often than not, you either end up waiting for the bus or running to catch the bus and missing it. Throughout this module and the associated learning path, you follow the scenario of catching the bus. In the first three modules of the learning path, you dove into the pieces that make up the final solution architecture. In this module, you'll review the solution architecture and put it all together.

In this module, you'll break down the scenario for an application and build a multi-service architecture, which is based on the microservices approach. In the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, or .NET), you'll deploy the solution in Azure with the help of GitHub Actions.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build new applications in Azure with deployment pipelines using the language of your choice and integrate them with serverless APIs and services, including Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, Azure Static Web Apps, and Azure Logic Apps.
