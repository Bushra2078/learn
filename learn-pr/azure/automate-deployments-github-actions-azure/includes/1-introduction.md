Architecting serverless, full-stack applications are greatly simplified in Azure due to the number of serverless services and the integrations that exist between them. Deploying Azure architectures with CI/CD in mind is easy with the support and integration of GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.

Getting the timing right of heading to the bus stop is a challenge that most can relate to. More often than not, you either end up waiting for the bus or running to catch the bus and missing it. Throughout this module and the associated learning path, you'll follow the scenario (and the development of a solution) of catching the bus. There is a complete learning path dedicated to exploring each piece of the architecture. In this module, you'll determine an architecture based on the scenario and deploy the entire solution with GitHub and the Azure Cloud Shell.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to deploy new applications in Azure with deployment pipelines using the language of your choice and integrate them with serverless APIs and services, including Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, Azure Static Web Apps, and Azure Logic Apps.
