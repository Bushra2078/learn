Building a serverless, full-stack application (like the catching the bus example) is greatly simplified in Azure due to the number of serverless services and the integrations that exist between them. GitHub Actions enables you to bring CI/CD easily to those applications.

Throughout the module and the learning path, you learned how:

* Azure SQL Database supports modern database requirements, including but not limited to JSON support, geospatial queries, and integrations with many other services.
* Azure Functions is a serverless compute platform for building scalable APIs.
* Azure Logic Apps is a great no-code/low-code platform for orchestrating and connecting to various services in and out of Azure.
* Azure Static Web Apps combines the capabilities of static web app hosting and APIs.
* GitHub Actions can be used to easily enable you to adopt CI/CD best practices.
