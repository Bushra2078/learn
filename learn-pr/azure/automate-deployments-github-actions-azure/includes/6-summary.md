Catching the bus can be a frustrating task. You might find yourself running to catch it (and missing it) or waiting for a long time.

Building serverless, full-stack applications (like the catching the bus example) is greatly simplified in Azure due to the number of serverless services and the integrations that exist between them. Doing all this with CI/CD in mind is easy with the support and integration of GitHub Actions.

Throughout the module and the learning path, you learned how:

    * Azure SQL Database supports modern database capabilities, including but not limited to JSON support, geospatial queries, and integrations with many other services.
    * Azure Functions is a serverless compute platform for building scalable APIs.
    * Azure Logic Apps is a great no-code/low-code platform for orchestrating and connecting to various services in and out of Azure
    * Azure Static Web Apps combines the capabilities of static web app hosting and APIs.
