  description: In the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, or .NET), deploy an end-to-end solution to solve the real-world scenario of catching the bus. You will learn how to build a solution that leverages Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, Azure Static Web Apps, Logic Apps, Visual Studio Code and GitHub Actions. This is the final module in the learning path that puts all of the pieces together, so if there are pieces you want to go deeper into, you can review the earlier modules.
