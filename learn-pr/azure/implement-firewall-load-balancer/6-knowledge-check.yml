  questions:
  - content: "How many different types of parameters does Datacenter Firewall support for defining its rules?"
    choices:
    - content: "Five"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Datacenter Firewall is a network layer, stateful, multitenant firewall. It supports five parameters: source and destination port numbers, source and destination IP addresses, and a protocol."
    - content: "Four"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Datacenter Firewall doesn’t use four parameters for defining its rules."
    - content: "Three"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Datacenter Firewall doesn’t use three parameters for defining its rules."
  - content: "To which two types of objects can an administrator assign an ACL of Datacenter Firewall?"
    choices:
    - content: "Logical network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You cannot assign an ACL to a logical network."
    - content: "VM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You cannot assign an ACL to a VM."
    - content: "Network subnet"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can assign an ACL to a VM network interface, logical network subnet, or virtual network subnet."
  - content: "What’s the most granular level at which an administrator can assign logging of Datacenter Firewall auditing?"
    choices:
    - content: "An ACL rule"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can enable logging on individual ACL rules."
    - content: "An ACL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can enable logging on individual ACL rules, not an ACL."
    - content: "A network subnet"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can enable logging on individual ACL rules, not a network subnet."
  - content: "Which mechanism does Network Controller use to advertise VIPs assigned to SLB multiplexer VMs to datacenter routers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Border Gateway Protocol"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Network Controller assigns VIPs to SLB multiplexer VMs, which, in turn, rely on Border Gateway Protocol to advertise VIPs to datacenter routers as individual /32 routes."
    - content: "Open Shortest Path First"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack HCI SDN doesn’t rely on Open Shortest Path First."
    - content: "Routing Information Protocol"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack HCI SDN doesn’t rely on Routing Information Protocol."
  - content: "On which layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model does SDN SLB operate?"
    choices:
    - content: "3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SDN SLB doesn’t provide Layer 3 load balancing for North-South and East-West TCP/UDP traffic."
    - content: "4"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SDN SLB provides Layer 4 load balancing for North-South and East-West TCP/UDP traffic."
    - content: "7"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SDN SLB doesn’t provide Layer 7 load balancing for North-South and East-West TCP/UDP traffic."
  - content: "Which of the following tasks doesn’t require creating a health probe object?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implementing inbound NAT"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. NAT doesn’t rely on health probes, because it doesn’t distribute traffic based on the operational status of a target VM."
    - content: "Implementing internal load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Load balancing rules require the use of a health probe."
    - content: "Implementing external load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Load balancing rules require the use of a health probe."
