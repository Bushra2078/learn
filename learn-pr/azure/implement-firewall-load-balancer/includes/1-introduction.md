Microsoft Azure Stack HCI-based Software Defined Networking (SDN) facilitates the implementation of software-defined filtering and load balancing of network traffic.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a large, US-based, financial-services company. The company develops and hosts in its own datacenters highly specialized, proprietary commercial applications for its customers.

As part of modernizing its technology, the company started deploying Azure Stack HCI across its on-premises locations. This has significantly accelerated datacenter consolidation, enhanced the agility of compute workloads, and helped minimize the dependency on expensive storage area networks (SANs) that are complex to manage.

However, your company continues to struggle with maintaining an elaborate network infrastructure that has a large number of devices from different vendors, with hundreds of virtual local area networks (VLANs). The network team finds it increasingly difficult to implement the degree of security and resiliency required to accommodate the needs of customers and to satisfy regulatory requirements.

To address these challenges, you decide to use the Software Defined Networking (SDN) capabilities of Azure Stack HCI. Your goal is to determine how you could provide network traffic filtering and load balancing by using dynamically scalable and modifiable virtualized networking devices.

You deployed an Azure Stack HCI unit including Network Controller into your proof-of-concept environment. Now, it's time to research and evaluate the relevant SDN functionality to determine the extent to which it could help you improve the security and resiliency of your infrastructure.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll explore the traffic filtering and load-balancing capabilities of SDN on Azure Stack HCI. You'll also review a couple of demonstrations illustrating a sample implementation and use of these capabilities.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe the architecture and core benefits of traffic filtering and load balancing of SDN on Azure Stack HCI. You'll also have a better understanding of the deployment process of these components of SDN on Azure Stack HCI.
