abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
    - Deploy Azure infrastructure, applications, database scripts, and storage blobs from a single workflow
    - Use workflow scripts and workflow actions to perform deployment steps
    - Use workflow artifacts to publish compiled files for your deployment workflow jobs to use
    - Pass data from your Bicep files to other deployment steps by using outputs
