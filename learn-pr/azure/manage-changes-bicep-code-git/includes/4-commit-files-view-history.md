Now that you've initialized your Git repository, you're ready to start adding files. In this unit, you'll learn how to tell Git to track the changes to files in your repository.

## Folder structure for your repository

When you work with a version control system like Git, it's important to plan how you store your files. It's a good idea to have a clear folder structure. 

If you're building Bicep code to deploy an application or another solution, it's also a good idea to store your Bicep files in the same repository as the application code and other files. That way, anytime someone needs to add a new feature that changes both Bicep and application code, they'll be tracked together. 

Planning your folder structure also makes it easier to deploy your solution from a pipeline. You'll learn about that in a future module.

Different teams have different conventions for how they set up their repository folders and files. Even if you aren't working with a team, it's still a good idea to decide on a convention to follow. This will help anyone who has to work with your code in future.

If your team doesn't already have a preference, here's a suggestion for how you might do it:

- At the root of your repository, create a _README.md_ file. This Markdown (text) file describes what's in the repository and gives instructions to help team members set things up.
- At the root of your repository, create a _deploy_ folder. Inside the folder:
  - Store your main Bicep template, named _main.bicep_.
  - Create a _modules_ subfolder, to store your Bicep modules.
  - If you have other scripts or files that are used during deployments, store them in the _deploy_ folder.
- At the root of your repository, create an _src_ folder. Use it to store application code.
- At the root of your repository, create a _docs_ folder. Use it to store documentation about your solution.

Here's an illustration of how this structure might look for your toy company's website:

## Stage your changes

When you make changes to a file or files, you first need to _stage_ them. Staging tells Git that you consider the changes important enough to keep. It might seem like an unnecessary step, but staging gives you a lot of flexibility as you work. For example, you might make changes to several files but want to commit only one of them. Or, you might want to commit only some of the changes that you've made to a file.

To stage a file, you use the `git add` command and specify the file name or folder name that you want to stage. After you do this, Git knows that you might want to commit the changes. When you query the repository status by using `git status`, you see the staged changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you stage a file, if you make any further changes to it before you commit, Git won't record those changes. You need to stage the file again for Git to catch the most recent changes.

For example, imagine you've just created a Bicep module to define an Azure Cosmos DB account. It's named _cosmos-db.bicep_, and you saved it in the *deploy/modules* folder. Here's how you could stage the file:

```bash
git add deploy/modules/cosmos-db.bicep
```

You can also stage all of the changes in your repo by running this command from the root folder of your repository:

```bash
git add .
```

## Commit the staged changes

A _commit_ represents a set of changes to one or more files in your repository. When you're ready to commit the changes you've staged, you use the `git commit` command. Your commit includes a _commit message_, which is a human-readable description of the changes.

Here's an example that shows how you commit the staged changes shown earlier:

```bash
git commit --message "Add Cosmos DB account definition."
```

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio Code can commit to your Git repository too. When you use Git integration in Visual Studio Code, if you haven't already staged the files, Visual Studio Code asks if you want it to stage all of the changed files for you. You can even set this as the default behavior. Or, if you prefer, you can manually stage and unstage files by using **Source Control** in Visual Studio Code.

Make your commit messages short, but make them descriptive. When you or a team member reviews the commit history in the future, each commit message should explain what the change was and why you made it.

There aren't any rules about what commit messages need to contain or how they're formatted. But conventionally, they're written in the present tense and in a full sentence, as if you're giving orders to your codebase.

> [!TIP]
> It's a good practice to write descriptive commit messages even when you're working on your own. Someone else might need to look at your code in the future. Even if they don't, you might need to review your own history, and you want to make your own life easier!

Here are some examples of good commit messages:
- _Update App Service configuration to add network configuration._
- _Remove storage account since it's been replaced by a Cosmos DB database._
- _Add Application Insights resource definition and integrate with function app._

## View a file's history

After you commit files to your Git repository, you can use the `git log` CLI command to view the history of a file or even all the commits to the repository.

To view a list of commits, run the following command:

```bash
git log --pretty=oneline
```

The output of this command shows a list of the commits, with the most recent commits first. Each line includes the _commit hash_, which is an identifier that Git internally uses to track each commit. It also includes the commit message, which is one of the reasons why it's so important to write good commit messages.

It's also common to view the commits to a specific file. You can specify the file name when you run the `git log` command, like this:

```bash
git log deploy/main.bicep
```

The Git CLI and the `git log` command provide many arguments that you can use to view information about your commits and files. However, it's often easier to use Visual Studio Code to view the commit history for a file. 

In the Visual Studio Code **Explorer** pane, you can select and hold (or right-click) a file in your repository and then select **View Timeline**. The **Timeline** pane opens and shows a list of each commit that affected that file. When you select a commit, you see the exact changes to the file. You'll see how to use this information in the next exercise.
