It would be convenient to have some necessary menus to follow you around instead of it being stuck to a place. You would have to search for the menu every time you wanted to select some option. MRTK provides a handy feature called, solvers that calculates an object's position and orientation using predefined algorithms.

Solvers provide a wide range of behavior to attach objects to other objects or systems. One example would be the tag-along object that appears in front of you (based on the camera) every time you moves.

## Directional indicator

Type of solver that helps tag-along components that orient themselves to the wanted direction of the object in space.

## Tap to place

TapToPlace is a far component that helps in placing an object over a surface. This component is valuable when you want to place objects on the spatial mesh.

Solvers are frequently used because of their vast use cases. They're relatively vital as they provide you some handy features for your applications. Based on your requirement, you can use different solvers; two of them are mentioned above. You must be clear about how your components must function to choose which solver will be better to mimic those requirements. You can add solvers by using the “Add Component” button in the inspector window and selecting the type of solver required.
