You've built up a significant number of Bicep modules, and now you need to share them with your colleagues. You also want to avoid writing Bicep code that someone else has already created for you. You decided to use public and private Bicep module registries to support your company's deployments.

In this module, you learned how the public Bicep module registry provides predefined Bicep files that create preconfigured resources or sets of resources. You then learned how you can create your own module registry, and how you can publish modules to share them with your organization.

By using module registries, you can support the sharing and reuse of Bicep code throughout your organization, and you can ensure that the modules that other people consume will meet your organization's requirements. Your colleagues can then create their own Bicep templates that compose together your modules, reducing the time it takes to define their infrastructure while also increasing the quality of their deployments.
