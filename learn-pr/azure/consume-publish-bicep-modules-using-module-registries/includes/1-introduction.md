## Example scenario

Suppose you're responsible for deploying and configuring the Azure infrastructure at a toy company. Recently, you three separate teams asked you to build Bicep templates that included a static website hosted on Azure Storage, and two of the templates included an Azure Functions app that had to be configured to meet your organization's requirements. You want to reuse your Bicep code as much as possible, so you created Bicep modules for the shared components. Now, you need to understand how to share and reuse the modules throughout your organization.
