The company has asked you to amend your new workflow to incorporate an escalation step to take action if a project design proposal isn't approved in a timely fashion.

In this exercise, you'll add a timer to control timeout during the execution of your workflow. You'll also learn how to use the timeout to control which execution path the workflow takes.

## Add moment npm package to your function app

Before changing our workflow, we'll add the **moment** npm package to our function app through the console. fv

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account that you used to activate the sandbox.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **All resources**, and then select the function app that you created in the previous exercise.

1. Under **Development Tools**, select **Console**.

1. When the console window opens, verify that you are in the _D:\home\site\wwwroot_ folder, then run the following command.

    ```command-prompt
    npm install typescript
    npm install moment
    ```

    These commands install the _typescript_ and _moment_ libraries. The _moment_ library contains date/time functions that you can use with durable functions, and the _typescript_ library is a dependency. These commands may take a few seconds to complete, and the node package manager may display some warnings that you can ignore.

1. Wait until all packages have finished installing, then close the console window.

## Add an escalation activity to your function app

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **All resources**, and then select your function app.

1. In the Azure portal, under **Functions**, select **Functions**, and then select **Add**.

1. Select the **Durable Functions activity** template. This template creates a durable function that is run when an Activity is called by an orchestrator function.

1. Name the function **Escalation**, and then select **Add**.

1. When the function is created, select **Code + Test**, and the code for the **index.js** file appears in the editor. Replace the existing code with the following code.

    ``` javascript
    module.exports = async function (context) {
        return `ESCALATION : You have not approved the project design proposal - reassigning to your Manager!  ${context.bindings.name}!`;
    };
    ```

    This code returns a message indicating that the workflow has been escalated. In a production system, this function would contain the logic to remind the recipient, or reassign the task.

1. Select **Save** to save your new function.

## Update the orchestration function to use the escalation function

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **All resources**, and then select your function app.

1. In the Azure portal, under **Functions**, select **Functions**, and then select your **OrchFunction** function that you created in the previous exercise.

1. When the function is created, select **Code + Test**, and the code for the **index.js** file appears in the editor.

1. Add a reference to the **moment** library.

    ```javascript
    const moment = require("moment");
    ```

1. Replace the body of the function with the following code, which will test whether the deadline for approval has passed.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
        const outputs = [];
        const deadline = moment.utc(context.df.currentUtcDateTime).add(20, "s");
        const activityTask = context.df.waitForExternalEvent("Approval");
        const timeoutTask = context.df.createTimer(deadline.toDate());

        const winner = yield context.df.Task.any([activityTask, timeoutTask]);
        if (winner === activityTask) {
            outputs.push(yield context.df.callActivity("Approval", "Approved"));
        }
        else
        {
            outputs.push(yield context.df.callActivity("Escalation", "Head of department"));
        }

        if (!timeoutTask.isCompleted) {
            // All pending timers must be complete or canceled before the function exits.
            timeoutTask.cancel();
        }

        return outputs;
    });
    ```

    To keep things brief for the purposes of this exercise, if the **Approval** function doesn't respond within 20 seconds, the **Escalation** function is called. The code also changes the call to **Approval** to wait for an external input. This way we can control when the response comes back for testing purposes.

1. Select **Save**.

## Verify that the Durable Functions workflow starts

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **All resources**, and then select your function app.

1. Under **Overview**, select **Restart**, and then select **Yes** when prompted to restart. Wait for the restart to complete before continuing.

1. Under **Functions**, select **Functions**, and then select your **HttpStart** function.

1. Select **Get Function URL**, and copy the URL. Your URL should resemble the following example.

    ```
    https://example.azurewebsites.net/api/orchestrators/{functionName}?code=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz==
    ```

    You'll use this URL to run your functions.

1. Open a new browser window, and navigate to the URL that you copied. In the URL, replace the **{functionName}** placeholder with **OrchFunction**, which should resemble the following example.

    ```
    https://example.azurewebsites.net/api/orchestrators/OrchFunction?code=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz==
    ```

   The response message contains a set of URI endpoints that you can use to monitor and manage the execution, which should resemble the following example.

    ```json
    {
      "id": "f0e1d2c3b4a5968778695a4b3c2d1e0f",
      "statusQueryGetUri": "https://example.azurewebsites.net/...",
      "sendEventPostUri": "https://example.azurewebsites.net/...",
      "terminatePostUri": "https://example.azurewebsites.net/...",
      "rewindPostUri": "https://example.azurewebsites.net/...",
      "purgeHistoryDeleteUri": "https://example.azurewebsites.net/..."
    }
    ```

1. Copy the **statusQueryGetUri** value, and use your web browser to navigate to this URL. You should see a response message that shows the status as _Running_ while it is waiting for the timer to countdown to 20 seconds, which should resemble the following example.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "OrchFunction",
      "instanceId": "f0e1d2c3b4a5968778695a4b3c2d1e0f",
      "runtimeStatus": "Running",
      "input": null,
      "customStatus": null,
      "output": null,
      "createdTime": "2019-04-14T13:17:26Z",
      "lastUpdatedTime": "2019-04-14T13:17:27Z"
    }
    ```

1. If you wait for 20 seconds and refresh the browser window, the timeout should have been reached, and the workflow will call the **Escalate** activity. You'll see a response that should resemble the following example.

    ```json
    {
        "name": "OrchFunction",
        "instanceId": "f0e1d2c3b4a5968778695a4b3c2d1e0f",
        "runtimeStatus": "Completed",
        "input": null,
        "customStatus": null,
        "output": [
            "ESCALATION : You have not approved the project design proposal - reassigning to your Manager!  Head of department!"
        ],
        "createdTime": "2019-04-14T13:43:09Z",
        "lastUpdatedTime": "2019-04-14T13:43:31Z"
    }
    ```
