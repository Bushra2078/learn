This exercise provides an overview of configuring rules and data export of IoT telemetry by using Azure IoT Central applications. For more information about these topics, refer to:

* [Configure rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/core/howto-configure-rules?azure-portal=true)
* [Create webhook actions on rules in Azure IoT Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/core/howto-create-webhooks?azure-portal=true)
* [Export IoT data to cloud destinations using data export](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/core/howto-export-data?azure-portal=true)

In this exercise, you'll:

* Create an Azure function that logs an HTTP request payload.
* Configure and validate IoT telemetry rules of an Azure IoT Central application.
* Create an Azure Storage account that will store IoT telemetry.
* Configure and validate data export of an Azure IoT Central application.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription
* A Microsoft account or an Azure AD account with the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription and with the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription
* Completion of the exercise unit **Set up Azure IoT Central**

## Create an Azure function that logs an HTTP request payload

Before you configure Azure IoT Central application rules, you'll create an Azure Function app that will help validate rule processing. When implementing your cloud-native application, you can easily replace the Azure Function app with any other component that supports the HTTP webhook functionality.

1. In a web browser, refer to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true) and sign in to access the Azure subscription you'll be using in this module.
1. Use the **Search resources, services, and docs** box at the beginning of the Azure portal page to search for **Function App**.
1. On the **Function App** blade, select **+ Add**.
1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create Function App** blade, configure the following settings, and then select **Next: Hosting >**:

   | Setting | Configuration |
   | --- | --- |
   | Subscription | Select the name of the Azure subscription you'll be using in this module. |
   | Resource Group | Create a new resource group named **iot-central-apps-RG**. |
   | Function App name | Enter a unique name consisting of lowercase letters, digits or dashes, and starting with a letter. |
   | Publish | Select **Code**. |
   | Runtime stack | Select **.NET**. |
   | Version | Select **3.1**. |
   | Region | Select the Azure region closest to the location of your lab environment, preferably matching the location you chose for the Azure IoT Central deployment. |

   using Newtonsoft.Json;

   public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req, ILogger log)
   {
       log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

       string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
       dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);

       string responseMessage = $"Payload: {data}. \nThis HTTP triggered function executed successfully."; 
       log.LogInformation(responseMessage);

       return new OkObjectResult(responseMessage);
   }
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The function logs the payload of the HTTP request, which, in this case, should represent the telemetry data forwarded to the function app's endpoint by the Azure IoT Central application you created in the previous exercise unit in this module.

1. On the **HttpTrigger1 \| Code + Test** blade, select **Get function URL**, and then record its value.

## Results

Congratulations! You completed the second exercise of this module. In this exercise, you:

* Created an Azure function that logs an HTTP request payload.
* Configured and validated IoT telemetry rules of an Azure IoT Central application.
* Created an Azure Storage account that will store IoT telemetry.
* Configured and validated data export of an Azure IoT Central application.

## Clean up the resources

To avoid unnecessary charges from using Azure resources, you should delete the **iot-central-apps-RG** resource group you created at the beginning of this exercise. To do so, in the Azure portal, navigate to the **iot-central-apps-RG** blade, and select the **Delete resource group** entry in the toolbar. In the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** textbox, enter **iot-central-apps-RG**, and then select **Delete**.
