You've now successfully completed the evaluation of Azure IoT Central. As a result, you're confident that Adatum's development team can extend the scope of its native-cloud applications to incorporate IoT telemetry.

In this module, you learned about the design and implementation of IoT telemetry data pipelines by using Azure IoT Central. You implemented a custom Azure IoT Central application, defined the capabilities of IoT devices, configured telemetry-driven rules for triggering alerts and remediating actions, and exported telemetry data to an internet-accessible data store.

Now that you've completed this module, you should know more about how to:

* Describe the role of Azure IoT Central.
* Design and implement Azure IoT Central-based telemetry processing.
