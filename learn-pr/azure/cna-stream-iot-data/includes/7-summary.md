Now that you have successfully completed the evaluation of Azure IoT Central, you are confident that the Adatum's development team will be able to extend the scope of its native-cloud applications to incorporate IoT telemetry. 

In this module, you learned about design and implementation of IoT telemetry data pipelines by using Azure IoT Central. Throughout its course, you implemented a custom Azure IoT Central application, defined capabilities of IoT devices, configured telemetry-driven rules for triggering alerts and remediating actions, as well as exported telemetry data to an internet-accessible data store.

Now that you have completed this module, you should be able to:

* Describe the role of Azure IoT Central. 
* Design and implement Azure IoT Central-based telemetry processing.
