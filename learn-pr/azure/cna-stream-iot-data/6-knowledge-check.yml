  questions:
  - content: 'Which Azure service serves as the basis for the built-in analytics functionality of Azure IoT Central?'
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Stream Analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stream Analytics is not part of Azure IoT Central. You have the option of implementing it in scenarios to address advanced stream processing requirements that exceed the capabilities of Time Series Insights built into the Azure IoT Central platform."
    - content: "Azure Time Series Insights"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure IoT Central analytics service, which allows you to visualize historical trends, correlate distinct telemetries, and detect anomalies in collected data based on built-in and custom reports leverages Azure Time Series Insights for telemetry processing."
    - content: "Azure Synapse Analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stream Analytics is not part of Azure IoT Central. This is a dedicated data analytics service that is intended for data warehousing scenarios."
  - content: 'Which Azure service supports interval-based export of telemetry data from Azure IoT Central?'
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Service Bus"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure IoT Central applications support continuous data export to Azure Event Hub, Azure Service Bus, and custom webhooks."
    - content: "Azure Event Hub"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure IoT Central applications support continuous data export to Azure Event Hub, Azure Service Bus, and custom webhooks."
    - content: "Azure Blob Storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It is possible to configure interval-based data export from Azure IoT Central to Azure Blob storage."
  - content: 'You onboarded an IoT device into your Azure IoT Central application and verified that you can see raw data representing telemetry generated by the device. You noticed, however, that the default dashboards you created to display the data are empty. Which component of the Azure IoT Central application should you modify to ensure that dashboards display the telemetry data?'
    choices:
    - content: "rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Rules evaluate conditions based on data coming from a device in order to determine when to trigger an action. They have no impact on visualization."
    - content: "device cloud properties"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cloud properties allow you to assign additional metadata to the virtual representation of individual devices in the cloud, regardless of the supported physical capabilities. They have no impact on visualization."
    - content: "device template"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. IoT Central accepts any syntactically valid JSON-formatted telemetry and displays it as raw data. However, telemetry characteristics, including the metrics names, must match their definition in the device model included in the device template in order for them to appear in the default and custom dashboards."
