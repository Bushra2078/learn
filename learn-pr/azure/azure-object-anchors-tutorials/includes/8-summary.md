In these Azure Object Anchors tutorials, you learned the fundamentals of Azure Object Anchors and explored the high-level overview of the Object Anchors Runtime SDK.
You also learned how to retrieve required resources from your Azure Object Anchors account.
Along with the theory, you also were able to use the sample project to create Azure Object Anchors model from your 3D model that exists in physical space.
You also used the created 3D model for object detection.

## Next steps

You can use the sample app as an example, continue adding more features for your project like improving the Mixed Reality experience by adding MRTK to the project.
You can use Azure Object Anchors along with our other Azure mixed reality services â€“ [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spatial-anchors/) and [Azure Remote Rendering](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/remote-rendering/) to build immersive mixed reality experiences with HoloLens.
