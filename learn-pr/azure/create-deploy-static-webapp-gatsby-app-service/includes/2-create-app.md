Static web sites have been around since the web's inception. At their essence, static web sites are made up of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. These static assets are what are served to a user. Static Site Generation (SSG) is the process in which you create static assets. You can either create the assets manually, one by one, or use a tool or framework. So why do static web sites continue to be prominent on the web today? There are some major reasons:

- **Fast loading websites**, our users will come to our site using different Internet speeds. A slow loading website means that our user might leave your site if it takes too long. That's lost business and revenue.
- **SEO, or search engine optimization**, helps the search engines to find your site. Web application frameworks use different techniques to *pre render* content and serve the content so search engine robots can index your site.
- **Markdown is popular**. Most people don't want to author documents in HTML. Instead, they want to use some high-level format. A popular format is for the moment Markdown. You need tools that can support converting from Markdown format to HTML.
- **Security**, when you're making a page static you can worry less about back-end security, because there is no back-end server.
- **How we build applications have evolved**, we can now carry out numerous things on the client-side that previously was done on the backend. In the early days of the Web, when a page was requested it had to be constructed on the server from markup and calls to services and databases. Since then it's now possible to construct pages dynamically using JavaScript and markup. This has a price. Dynamically constructing a page is never as fast as serving the user an already rendered static site. It also affects SEO as search engine robots can't find dynamic pages. You need a technique to handle that.

Modern sites can be massive applications. You can make sites fast to load by identifying which parts of you app can be static. The parts that can be made static can be served fast. To accomplish this, you use a pre-compilation step.

## Gatsby

Gatsby is a command-line tool. It helps you generate static sites using technologies such as React, GraphQL, and different types of data. The input to the command-line tool is your Gatsby project consisting of React components. You author the components and any assets that you want to add to the site. The output is HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with any static assets you might have included such as image files. 

Gatsby is built on top of React and React Router, which allows you to mix both dynamic and static parts. So even though it's a tool for primarily producing static sites, it's fully capable of compiling a React project. Thereby Gatsby can replace your normal set-up for producing apps with React, providing you have part of your React app that you want to make static.

Gatsby has a clever system of plugins that can help import data from different types of data sources. The data sources can be as varied as databases to JSON to your local file system. All this imported data can then be paired up with static assets like HTML and CSS to produce the static pages you want to serve to a user. Thanks to the plugin system, more and more different types of data sources can be supported and is being supported as soon as the Gatsby team or the community writes a new plugin.

How does Gatsby do this? In the pre-compilation phase, each plugin *scans* a source. A source can be a file system, a database, or, for example, a set of JSON files. The data is read and added to a data Graph. The Graph is an in-memory tree of nodes that you can query for. Gatsby then let's you query for these nodes when you proceed to author your static pages in your app.

### Technologies used

Gatsby relies on two core technologies:

- **React.js** is the SPA framework that Gatsby uses. You need to have a rudimentary understanding of developing in React before using Gatsby. You should know how to create components in React.js and work with input properties. You will be using React.js in Gatsby to create components to either support the building of pages or to build the pages themselves. Additionally you will also use components to build layouts.
- **GraphQL** is a query language used to query for your website's data but also for external data. GraphQL is a query language used for querying APIs. It's able to *negotiate* with the API exactly for what resources and columns it wants from the API. This solves many problems that exist currently with APIs like over-fetching or many round-trips extra to the server. In the context of Gatsby, GraphQL is used to fetch JSON data from an in-memory data graph to help you assemble pages from fetched JSON data and markup. It's possible to build a Gatsby site without GraphQL but it becomes so much easier if you do use it.

## Installing and using Gatsby

Gatsby is available via the `gatsby-cli` JavaScript package. You have two ways you can use it:

- **Global install**, run  `npm install gatsby-cli -g`, this will install the executable `gatsby` on your machine. You can now use Gatsby like so, `gatsby <command>`.
- **Use npx**, `npx` is a tool that makes it possible to run executable files without first installing them on your machine. If you use this way of installing you need to prefix your calls to Gatsby like so `npx gatsby <command>`.

These three commands will get you started working with a new Gatsby app:

- `gatsby new <project name> <optional GitHub URL>`: Use this command to generate a new project. It takes a name as a mandatory argument and optionally a GitHub URL as the second argument. Using the latter argument will create a Gatsby project based on an existing Gatsby project on GitHub.
- `gatsby develop`: Start a development server where your project can be accessed. A development server is an HTTP server able to host your files so you can access them from your browser. You will find your Gatsby app running on address `http://localhost:8000`. It will also start an instance of GraphiQL, which is a graphical development tool you can use to explore the data available to your app and build queries. You can use GraphiQL by browsing to `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.
- `gatsby build`: Create a deployable static representation of your app. All the resulting HTML, JavaScript, and CSS will end up in the sub directory `public`.

## Project anatomy

A scaffolded Gatsby project consists of some parts that you need to understand to work with Gatsby effectively and efficiently.

- `/pages`: React components placed in this directory will become routes and a pages. Pages are described in more detail below.
- `gatsby-config.js`: A configuration file. Part of the configuration will be used to set up and configure plugins and part of it is global data that you can render on your pages.
- `gatsby-node.js`: A file used to implement life-cycle methods of the Gatsby API. In here you can do things such as sourcing files, add/update nodes to the Gatsby graph and even bring in data from the outside that should be part of the website.
- `/styles`: Gatsby lets you apply styles in many ways, everything from imported CSS, SASS, and LESS to CSS Modules.
- `/components`: For React components meant as helper components like header, layout and more.

### Pages

One of the most important things to be created in a new Gatsby project is the sub directory `/pages`. Any React component placed in here will be rendered as an actual static page and will be accessible via a browser. Take the following example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const HelloPage = () => (<div>Hello</div>)

export default HelloPage;
```

Putting this into a file named `/pages/hello.js` will lead to a route being created at `/hello`. Browsing there will result in a page that displays the string `Hello` between two `div` tags.
