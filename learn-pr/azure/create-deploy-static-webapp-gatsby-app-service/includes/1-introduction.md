Imagine you are working on an e-commerce site. One of the most important factors you deal with is ensuring that your product pages can be found through a search engine and also that these pages load fast. A slow loading page might make the user navigate away from your site and you lose potential business. To ensure your users find your product pages, you need to ensure all your pages can be navigated to and that they are appropriately tagged with relevant keywords. By doing this, a web crawler like Google or Bing can index your page and it will be found once a user searches for it. We call this process SEO or search engine optimization. 

A way to approach that all your pages can be found is by using a Static site generation tool. The data needed to build those static pages might reside in all sorts of places like inside of JSON, XML, YAML files, or in a database, or even a third party service accessible through the Web. Producing these static pages is for that reason a bit of a complex process. Using a static site generation tool to produce these static pages have therefore become a necessity.

Once we have produced these static pages, that a search engine will list high in a search result, we need to think about how to deploy them to the Web. To stay competitive, we need a service that can allow for easily deploying of our pages fast but also that we able to repeat this often. The less time we can spend on configuring our app deployment the more time we can spend on improving its features.

In this module, you will learn to create static pages using the static site generation tool Gatsby. You will then persist the result in a Git repository on GitHub. Lastly you will host your files in the Cloud using the Azure Static apps service.

By the end of the module you will learn how to use Gatsby but also how to configure and deploy your files to the Cloud using Azure Static apps Service.

## Learning Objectives

In this tutorial, you create a Static app using Gatsby and deploy it to Azure through the following steps:

1. You'll start by learning how to use the tool Gatsby to create static apps in general.
2. Then you prepare your project for deployment by turning it into a Git repository and push it to GitHub.
3. Finally you use the Azure Static apps service to configure and deploy your app so it's reachable from the Web.
