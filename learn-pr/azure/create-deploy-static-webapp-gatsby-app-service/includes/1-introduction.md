Imagine you are working on an e-commerce site. You want to ensure that your product pages can be found through a search engine and that they load quickly. Regardless of what tech approach you choose, you want to ensure you use something that follows best practices for architecture. The frameworks and techniques you select should be commonly used so you can find help if you need it.

One way to approach building an app like this is to use a *static site generator*. With a static site generator, you can assemble a static site from content and data in all sorts of places like inside of JSON, XML, YAML files, or in a database, or even a third-party service accessible through the Web. Producing these static pages is for that reason a bit of a complex process. Using a static site generation tool to produce these static pages have therefore become a necessity.

Once you have produced these static pages, you need to think about how to deploy them to the Web. To stay competitive, you need a service that can allow for easy and fast deployment of our pages. The less time you spend on configuring your app deployment, the more time you can spend on improving its features.

In this module, you will use the Gatsby command-line tools to create a new web app. You'll create a page in the app and add content to it with Gatsby's querying tools. Lastly, you will deploy your app to the web using the Azure Static Web Apps service.

By the end of the module, you will be able to create web apps with Gatsby and publish them to the web.
