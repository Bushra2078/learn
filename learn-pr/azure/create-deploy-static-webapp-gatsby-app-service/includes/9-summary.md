You started with a challenge of addressing common problems in the web development space including SEO, page speed load and also ensuring you had a reliable architecture building out your app.

You evaluated the command line tool Gatsby to address the above problems. Gatsby's approach was to produce a set of static pages that would load fast and be easy for a search engine to index effectively.

Gatsby relied on core technologies React.js and GraphQL. You were introduced to an important concept in Gatsby, an in-memory data graph. Using JSON data from the in-memory graph would help you produce pages using React.js components and said data. To be able to fetch data from the Graph you learned to author GraphQL queries and thereby learned some rudimentary GraphQL.

You were also told how plugins is something that will extend Gatsby's capability in handling different types of content. Plugins is something that during a build process was able to *source* content data from almost anywhere, and place that in the built-in Graph you've learned to query. Learning to leverage plugins will prove useful for the future as you can continue to build out your app from different kinds of content like Markdown, JSON and even service endpoints among many other content sources.

Additionally you've learned how Gatsby was able to produce a *build*, a deployable set of files consisting of nothing but HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Building your app prepared it so it could be deployed almost anywhere.

Finally you addressed how to deploy your app. You learned about the Static Web apps service an Azure service capable of deploying your Gatsby app to Azure. You used the Static Web apps service to deploy your app in minutes.
