- Azure Arc 
- Azure ARM 

## Prerequisites

- Foundational understanding of cloud adoption 
- Understanding of your organization’s operations management requirements 

## Summary

As workloads are deployed to the cloud, operations is critical to success. In this learn module, you will learn how to deploy an operations baseline to manage and optimize all workloads in your environment. You will also learn how to enhance the baseline, deliver richer platform operations for shared technology platforms, and when to apply the well-architected framework to optimize individual workloads. 

## Learning objectives

Learning objectives <br>
- Evaluate levels of business commitment across your portfolio of workloads 
- Deploy an operations baseline 
- Customize the baseline to meet operations needs 
- Centralize operations for core platforms 
- Partner with workload teams for richer decentralized operations

## Outline the units

**1. Customer Story**

As part of the strategy to rethink IT operations, Tailwind Traders will deploy a new management strategy. 
The legacy management solution has delivered the same requirement for all business workloads, without any real agreement between IT and the business. Tailwind Traders would like to establish a customer-vendor relationship between IT and the business units.  


**2. Establish business commitments**

The desired state of operations would be to ensure that all workloads have 5 9’s of uptime and can automatically recovery in case of any interruptions. That desired state is achievable, but true reliability is expensive at scale.  

Across the customer’s portfolio, there exist different requirements for operational support. The CAF section on management considerations proposes a pragmatic approach to achieving the right levels of reliability. This section will teach readers to classify all workloads based on criticality and time/value to determine which workloads get hands-on operations & high reliability, which platforms require reliability improvements, and which platforms/workloads can survive with a minimum amount of support through an operations baseline. The operations management workbook can help capture those drivers and decision. 

**3. Deploy an operations baseline**

Operations baseline is the foundation for operations management. In Azure, we have a simple implementation to build the principles of an operations baseline into everything you do in Azure. The Azure Server Management guide is the process for implementing that operations baseline. This unit should deliver an exercise to replicate the key parts of that process. Specifically, showing how to turn on monitoring for Inventory & Visibility, Patch Management & Azure Advisor for Operational Optimization, and Azure Back for Protection and Recovery. 

In this unit, we should also speak to Azure Automanage & how a simple deployment of that feature implements the features of the Azure Server Management guide with a single click. 

**4. Enhance the baseline**

The operations baseline described in the prior unit will likely not be enough to satisfy all of the operational requirements for even your lowest priority workloads. You will need more. In this unit, share a few examples of things customers may add to the operations baseline to enhance operations for the entire portfolio. Examples from the current article could include things like creating runbooks to automate common tasks, or leveraging features like Azure Advisor/Security Center/.. to monitor for required conditions, or could include customer dashboards/alerts to see things that are important across the portfolio. 

**5. Managing platform operations**

Often, individual workloads don’t have a high impact on the business making them less critical. But when you look at core platforms like SAP, SQL, WVD, etc., you can see clusters of workloads that collective have a big impact. 

Platform operations looks at ways to improve reliability of those workloads by improving reliability of the common technology platform. In this unit, discuss options for improving platform operations through the use of centrally managed instance of the core platform. That would include high operations responsibilities for monitoring, patching, protection, and tuning than other assets. It would also include use of an ESLZ construction set to harden the environment that hosts that tech platform or the use of a service catalog to create a repeatable, approved deployment of that tech platform. It would also include continuous improvements through richer reporting tools. 

Explain the options & Choose one of these examples to build hands on exercise. 

**6. Managing workload operations**

Workload operations is the home of the Well-Architected Framework. For a smaller percentage of workloads, neither the operations baseline nor platform operations is sufficient to drive the required degree of reliability.  

To hit the coveted 5 9’s type of solution, a per workload investment is required. In this unit, discuss how the customer would create the right processes between central operations and workload operations to ensure that each workload team is building on the tools and processes already in place. 

Then add tools like app insights to help the workload team have greater insights into their apps & make decisions based on a combination of app insights, Azure advisor, and the well architected review. 

**7. Summary**

Review the value of a tiered approach to operations. Include links to WAF/WAR for additional learning about continued operations of individual workloads.
