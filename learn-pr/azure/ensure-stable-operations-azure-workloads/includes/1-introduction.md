## Introduction
As a business moves to a cloud-based model, the importance of proper management and operations can't be overstated. When moving to the cloud, traditional IT management roles, requirements, and responsibilities change. For example, the cloud provides the possibility to bring management closer to the developers and workload specified teams. In Azure it is possible to visualize what management solutions cost per workload. In other words, the business can balance management cost against how critical the workload is.

A management baseline is the minimum set of tools applied to all resources in the environment. This module will walk through the three disciplines in a cloud management baseline, including

-	Inventory and visibility. Inventorying assets and creating visibility into the run state of each resource of a workload
-	Operational compliance. Management of configuration, sizing, cost, and performance of assets
-	Protect and recover. Data protection and quick recovery to minimizing operational interruptions 

The module will then discuss how to enhance the management baseline. In the end of the module we will talk about how the specialization principles and platform specialization. Both workload specialization and platform specializationcan can support our most critical workloads and platforms. The start of the module will look into business alignment to make sure everyone uses the same terms. The image below shows the components of a management baseline that this module will cover.

### Module Scenario
Suppose you work as an IT operations architect at Trey Research. The company has decided to transform its current IT management solution to a cloud-native solution as part of the company cloud journey. In the new cloud-native solution there will be a management baseline for the cloud environment. The fundamental management baseline will be for all workloads, and some extra features for specific platforms and workloads. The solution should also enable reporting on management costs for the business stakeholders. 

### Learning goals
In this module, you will learn to
-	Set a baseline for criticality, impact, and commitment for your business
-	Understand which Azure management tools to include in a management baseline
-	How to partner with workload and platform teams for more prosperous decentralized operations

### Prerequisites
-	A foundational understanding of cloud adoption
-	Understanding of your organization's operations management requirements
