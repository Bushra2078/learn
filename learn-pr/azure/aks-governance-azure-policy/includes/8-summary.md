At the beginning of this module, you needed to block new deployments from untrusted registries to your Azure Kubernetes cluster, and present a report of the status of your cluster against that policy.

In this module, you learned how Azure policy for Kubernetes can be used to achieve this goal. You created an AKS cluster with the Azure policy add-on enabled. After that, you assigned a policy to that cluster to prevent pulling from a non-authorized container registry. Finally, you were able to show the compliance state of your cluster against this policy.

### TODO: add links.
