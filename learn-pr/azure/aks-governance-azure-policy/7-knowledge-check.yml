quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "If a Policy is applied with the deny option to a resource group, what happens to already existing non-compliant resources in that group?"
      choices:
        - content: "The non-compliant resources get deleted."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Policy does not delete Azure resources"
        - content: "No changes will be made to the resources themselves but they will be listed as non-compliant resources."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Azure Policy does not delete resources but you can always check for non-compliant already existing resources."
        - content: "The resources will have a read-only lock on them so that no changes can be made to them."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Policies does not lock already deployed resources"
        - content: "The resources become unusable and cannot be used to connect to other resources"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Policies does not render already deployed resources unusable"
    
    - content: "What happens when you have a policy set as deny at the subscription level and the same Policy set as audit at the subscription level?"
      choices:
        - content: "The two Policies will cancel each other and will have no effect"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Policies do not cancel each other out when there is a conflict."
        - content: "The Policy set as audit will take effect."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Because the resource group scope is closer to the resource than the subscription, the Policy set at the subscription level will take effect"
        - content: "The Policy set as deny will take effect."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is not correct."
        - content: "You will get an error when you attempt to deploy the second policy that contradicts the first one and will be unable to proceed."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Policies do not prevent other Policy from being deployed because of a contradiction"

    - content: "How do you ensure that a Policy applies to all the resources except a particular resource?"
      choices:
        - content: "Move the resource to another resource group and apply the Policy to the previous resource group."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This would solve the problem but may not work if that resource needs to stay in that resource group for whatever reason."
        - content: "Apply the Policy at the resource level to the resources that need to have it in that resource group."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You cannot apply a Policy at the resource level."
        - content: "Tell your coworkers not to deploy resources that are not compliant with that Policy and add it to your training manual."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This may work but may require a lot of manual work. This is not the best option in this scenario"
        - content: "Add an exclusion to the resource that the Policy should not apply to."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Azure Policies allows you to add exclusions you can use to exempt certain resources from having to comply with the Policy."
