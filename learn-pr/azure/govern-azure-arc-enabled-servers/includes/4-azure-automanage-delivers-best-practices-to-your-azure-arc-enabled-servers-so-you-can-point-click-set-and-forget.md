Fabrikam Residences is interested in automatically leveraging Azure best practices for not just their Azure VMs, but their servers in other clouds and on-premises. In this unit, you’ll learn how Azure Automanage can be used to click, set, and forget servers anywhere. 

## Overview of Azure Automanage

Azure Automanage machine best practices is a service that eliminates the need to discover, know how to onboard, and how to configure certain services in Azure that would benefit your servers. These services are Azure best practices services, helping enhance reliability, security, and management for Arc-enabled servers. 



Azure Automanage Best Practices can be readily applied to Azure Arc-enabled servers to:

- Intelligently onboard servers to select best practices Azure services
- Automatically configures each service per Azure best practices
- Supports customization of best practice services
- Monitors for drift and corrects for it when detected

  

## Participating services

These Azure services are automatically onboarded for you when you use Automanage Machine Best Practices on an Azure Arc-enabled server:

- **Machine Insights Monitoring.** Azure Monitor for machines monitors the performance and health of your virtual machines, including their running processes and dependencies on other resources.
- **Update Management.** You can use Update Management in Azure Automation to manage operating system updates for your machines. You can quickly assess the status of available updates on all agent machines and manage the process of installing required updates for servers.
- **Change Tracking & Inventory.** Change Tracking and Inventory combines change tracking and inventory functions to allow you to track virtual machine and server infrastructure changes. The service supports change tracking across services, daemons software, registry, and files in your environment to help you diagnose unwanted changes and raise alerts. Inventory support allows you to query in-guest resources for visibility into installed applications and other configuration items.
- **Azure Guest Configuration. **Guest Configuration policy is used to monitor the configuration and report on the compliance of the machine. The guest configuration service will install the Azure Compute security baseline in audit-only mode. 
- **Azure Automation Account. **Azure Automation supports management throughout the lifecycle of your infrastructure and applications.
- **Log Analytics Workspace.** Azure Monitor stores log data in a Log Analytics workspace, which is an Azure resource and a container where data is collected, aggregated, and serves as an administrative boundary.

## Onboarding Arc-enabled servers to Azure Automanage

You can onboard Arc-enabled servers to Automanage directly from Azure portal, through Azure Policy, or with an ARM template.

To onboard with Azure portal, you can find Automanage – Azure machine best practices in Azure portal. There you can select, which VMs and Azure Arc-enabled servers to onboard, as well as their configuration profiles with specific best practices. 

To onboard servers at scale to Azure Automanage, you can use the built-in Azure Policy Configure virtual machines to be onboarded to Azure Automanage. Finally, you can use an ARM template to onboard your specified Azure Arc-enabled server onto Azure Automanage Best Practices. 

Across Azure portal, Azure Policy, and ARM templates, there are versatile ways to onboard your Azure Arc-enabled servers to Azure Automanage best practices.
