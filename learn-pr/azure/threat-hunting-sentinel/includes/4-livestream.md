You can use the hunting livestream to test queries against live events, as they occur. Livestream provides interactive sessions that can notify you when matching events for your query are found.

A livestream is always based on a query. Typically the query is used to narrow down streaming log events so you see only the events that are related to your threat hunting efforts. You can use a livestream to:

- Test new queries against live events.
- Generate notifications for threats.
- Launch investigations.

## Create a livestream

To create a livestream from the Hunting page in Azure Sentinel, select the **Livestream** tab and then select **New livestream** from the toolbar.

On the new Livestream page, specify a name for the livestream session and the query that will provide results for the session.

You can play the livestream to view results, or save the livestream for later reference. Saved livestreams can be viewed from the Livestream tab on the Hunting page. You can also elevate a livestream session to an alert by selecting **Elevate to alert** from the command bar of any livestream.
