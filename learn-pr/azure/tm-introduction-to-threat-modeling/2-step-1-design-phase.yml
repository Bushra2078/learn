  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What happens at the Design Phase?"
    choices:
    - content: "You have a good idea of how the system works (or will work) and can identify security requirements, guarantees and/or gaps inherited from cloud providers and integrated services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "At this phase, before creating a data-flow diagram, it is important to gather as much context as possible about what, where and how you are building your system"
    - content: "You don't have to worry about researching all the security guarantees, assumptions and gaps at this point since the only work is to create a data-flow diagram"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Having as much context as possible earlier in the design phase allows you to make good decisions to better secure your system"
    - content: "You identify all security issues associated with your system and resolve them before creating your data-flow diagram"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This comes after the design phase as part of the break and fix phases"
