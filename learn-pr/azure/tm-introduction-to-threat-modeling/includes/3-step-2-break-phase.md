Threat modeling helps you focus on the right areas and provides you with a framework that generates potential threats and suggests strategies that help reduce or eliminate risk.

First, choose between:

- Identifying your attacker and their motives, or 
- Systematically finding weaknesses in your system

Microsoft product engineers mostly focus on system weaknesses. Penetration testing teams focus on both.

Next, select a framework to help generate all the different ways to break your system. Microsoft traditionally uses STRIDE, the acronym for the six main threat categories that provide an extensive, but not exhaustive, list of threats:

| Category | Description |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Spoofing | Pretending to be someone or something else |
| Tampering | Changing data without authorization |
| Repudiation | Claiming to not have done something |
| Information Disclosure | Seeing data you're not supposed to see |
| Denial of Service | Bringing your system down |
|Elevation of Privilege| Having unauthorized access to data |
