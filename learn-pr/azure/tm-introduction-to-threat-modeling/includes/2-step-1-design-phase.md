Capture system requirements and security assumptions in writing with as much context as possible. Examples include:

- Use-case scenarios
- Access control requirements
- Process descriptions
- Security assumptions from cloud providers, operating systems, internal and external services

If you have a dedicated security team, schedule a white-boarding session with them to go over the initial plans and design. It can save you a considerable amount of time.

Use the list to create your data-flow diagram, which is a graphical representation of your system that highlights the data-flow lifecycle as it passes trust zones and processes. Examples include human users, service endpoints, and data stores. Microsoft engineering teams are required to submit data-flow diagrams as part of their security compliance requirements.
