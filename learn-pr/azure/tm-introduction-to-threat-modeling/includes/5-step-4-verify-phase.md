As you reach the final stages of completing your system, verify that:

- Risk is properly reduced or eliminated
- Security assumptions are still valid for your services providers, open-source components, and any functionality outside of your direct control

Risk and assumption verification can be done manually, automatically or both. At Microsoft, services are subject to a verification process before deployment. It may consist of automated scanners, code reviews, and penetration tests.

The verification process can be enforced before each deployment or in time intervals, like every 6-12 months. The process cadence depends on:

- The nature of the system, such as external use or confidential data handling
- Additional security factors pre-determined by the organization, such as privacy implications, operational risk, or development requirements
