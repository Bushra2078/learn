Threat modeling is an effective way to help secure your systems, applications, networks, and services.

It identifies potential threats and recommends risk reduction strategies to help you meet security objectives earlier in the development lifecycle.

In this module, you explored the four high-level steps of threat modeling. You:

- Understood the importance of capturing requirements and assumptions to help create a data-flow diagram
- Read about the framework that helps you find security issues in a system
- Learned about the security control categories that help you reduce or eliminate potential threats
- Highlighted the importance of verifying assumptions, requirements, and fixes before deployment

## What's Next

In the next few modules, we'll visit each concept introduced throughout the four phases and discuss them in detail:

|Module|Title|Description|
|------|-----|-----------|
|2|Create a Threat Model Using Data-Flow Diagram Elements|Learn about each element in a data-flow diagram, including when to use them and what context to include|
|3|Provide Context with the Right Depth Layer|Learn the differences between each context depth layer and when to use them before creating your data-flow diagram|
|4|Approach Your Data-Flow Diagram with the Right Threat Model Focus|Learn about the different ways to focus your threat modeling activities|
|5|Use a Framework to Identify Threats and Find Ways to Reduce or Eliminate Risk|Deep-dive into STRIDE and learn more about what's at risk and how to protect your system against it|
|6|Prioritize Your Issues and Apply Security Controls|Learn to prioritize threats and understand the different types and functions of security controls for your system|
|7|Use Recommended Tools to Create a Data-Flow Diagram|Check out some of the tools you can use for threat modeling|
