Threat modeling is an effective way to help secure your systems, applications, networks and services. Microsoft defines it as an engineering technique that identifies both potential threats and recommendations to help reduce risk and meet security objectives as early as possible in the development lifecycle. This technique helps you build graphical representations of systems, known as a data-flow diagrams, and gives you a framework to help fix security issues that could cost valuable customer trust, assets and engineering time.

In this module, you explored the four high-level steps that comprise threat modeling. You understood the importance of enumerating all assumptions, requirements and processes prior to creating your data-flow diagram, explored how STRIDE can help identify threats and suggest security controls to reduce or eliminate risk, and learned how important it is to ensure your work is verified to minimize risk for customers.
