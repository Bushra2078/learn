Threat modeling is an effective way to help secure your systems, applications, networks and services. Microsoft defines it as an engineering technique that identifies both potential threats and recommendations to help reduce risk and meet security objectives as early as possible in the development lifecycle. This technique helps you build graphical representations of systems, known as a data-flow diagrams, and gives you a framework to help fix security issues that could cost valuable customer trust, assets and engineering time.

Regardless of security expertise (although a basic understanding of security is recommended), threat modeling can be used by anyone who knows how the system works (or will work), and can be applied across any software delivery approach (e.g. Agile, Waterfall) or deployment cadence (e.g. hourly, monthly).

In this module, you'll explore the four high-level steps of threat modeling. We will study these terms in detail with each subsequent module.

[!NOTE]
To simplify the learning process, we will refer to systems, applications and services as "systems."

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- The importance of capturing requirements and assumptions to help create a data-flow diagram.
- The framework that helps you find security issues in a system.
- The security control categories that help you reduce or eliminate potential threats.
- The importance of verifying assumptions, requirements and fixes prior to deployment.

## Prerequisites

- None
