## What It's About

Threat modeling is an effective technique to help secure your systems, applications, networks, and services. It helps you identify potential threats and risk reduction strategies earlier in the development lifecycle.

> [!NOTE]
> To make things easier, this learning path will refer to systems, applications, and services as just systems.

## When to Use It

Use threat modeling whenever you design new systems or update existing ones. Examples include:

- Creating a new Azure micro-service that reports on your organization's cloud resource usage for budgeting purposes
- Designing a public API to provide customers access to your data
- Adding a new feature to an existing application

## What To Expect

Threat modeling is an excellent technique. It uses a data-flow diagram that graphically shows how the system works, and applies a framework to help you find and fix security issues.

Systems released without being first threat modeled places your customers and organization at risk.

## Who Can Threat Model?

Anyone with a working knowledge of the system and a basic understanding of security can work with threat modeling. This technique can be applied across any:

- Software delivery approach, like Agile or Waterfall
- Deployment cadence, like hourly, monthly, or yearly

In this module, you'll explore the four high-level steps of threat modeling.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of capturing requirements and assumptions to help create a data-flow diagram
- Read about the framework that helps you find security issues in a system
- Learn about the security control categories that help you reduce or eliminate potential threats
- Highlight the importance of verifying assumptions, requirements, and fixes before deployment

## Prerequisites

- None
