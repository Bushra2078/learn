Threat modeling is a technique used by anyone who knows how the system works and has a working knowledge of information security. 

The technique is broken down into four different phases, each containing important steps to help you create a data-flow diagram and analyze it for potential threats.

![Threat Modeling Phases](../media/threat-modeling-steps.png)

Here are the phases:

- **Phase 1 - Design Phase** - capture all requirements for your system and create a data-flow diagram
- **Phase 2 - Break Phase** - apply a threat modeling framework to the data-flow diagram and find potential security issues
- **Phase 3 - Fix Phase** - decide how to approach each issue with the right combination of security controls
- **Phase 4 - Verify Phase** - verify requirements are met, issues are found, and security controls are implemented

Let's discuss each phase in the next few units.
