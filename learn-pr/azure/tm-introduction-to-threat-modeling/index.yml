title: Introduction to Threat Modeling
summary: Threat modeling is an effective way to help secure your systems, applications, networks, and services. Microsoft defines it as an engineering technique that identifies both potential threats and recommendations to help reduce or eliminate risk and meet security objectives as early as possible in the development lifecycle. This technique helps you build graphical representations of systems, known as a data-flow diagrams. It also provides you with a framework to help fix security issues that could cost valuable customer trust, assets, and engineering time.
