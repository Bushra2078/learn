Azure ExpressRoute allows your organization to leverage a high-speed private connection to connect on-premises networks to Microsoft cloud services including Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. As it is a dedicated connection between your on-premises networks and Azure, connectivity will not be subject to the delays, disruptions, and fluctuating bandwidth that can occur when VPN connections across the public internet are used to link on-premises locations to the Microsoft Cloud 

You are responsible for networking at Adatum, a new and expanding company that provides drone video services. At the moment, your organization uses a site-to-site VPN connection to connect hosts on the on-premises network to services hosted in Azure. Adatum’s workers use Azure IaaS virtual machines for video post-processing tasks and Azure File Shares to store high resolution video data. 

Recently you have found that the quality of the site-to-site VPN connection fluctuates during the day which directly impacts the workflow at Adatum. Sometimes this means connectivity to IaaS VMs running video processing software is lagged, at other times transfers of video files from Adatum’s offices to Azure File Shares can slow or even stall, with some transfers of files taking minutes and others hours. 

As networking is your responsibility, you would like to improve the bandwidth and reliability of the connection between Adatum’s main site and the Azure datacenters where their workloads reside. As some of the clients you work with have Adatum produce sensitive drone imagery related to mineral exploration claims, you would also like to minimize the amount of network traffic between your organization’s on-premises network and Microsoft’s cloud services that passes across the public internet.  

This module explains what Azure ExpressRoute does, how it works, and when you should choose to use Azure ExpressRoute as a solution to meet Adatum’s needs.
