  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: You work for Adatum. Adatum has branch office locations in Auckland and Seattle. Each branch office location has an ExpressRoute connection configured. You want to ensure that data transferred from servers in Auckland to servers in Seattle uses the Azure global network backbone rather than being transferred across the public internet. Which ExpressRoute feature would you use to achieve this goal?
      choices:
        - content: Site-to-Site VPN
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Site-to-Site VPNs usually use the public internet.
        - content: ExpressRoute Global Reach
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. ExpressRoute Global Reach allows you to route traffic between on-premises locations that have ExpressRoute connections across the Azure global network backbone.
        - content: ExpressRoute Direct
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. ExpressRoute direct is a model for how your on-premises location connects to ExpressRoute, it does not ensure traffic does not pass across the public internet.          
    - content: At which of the following Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model layers does ExpressRoute provide connectivity between hosts on an on-premises network and IaaS VM hosts on an Azure virtual network?
      choices: 
        - content: OSI Layer 1
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. ExpressRoute provides connectivity between hosts on an on-premises network at OSI Layer 3 and above.          
        - content: OSI Layer 2
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. ExpressRoute provides connectivity between hosts on an on-premises network at OSI Layer 3 and above.          
        - content: OSI Layer 3
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. ExpressRoute provides connectivity between hosts on an on-premises network at OSI Layer 3 and above.          
    - content: Several users at Adatum work remotely using laptops with cellular internet connections. These users only visit Adatum's on-premises sites once or twice a month. Which of the following methods should these users use to connect to resources in Azure?
      choices:
        - content: Azure ExpressRoute
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Azure ExpressRoute isn't an appropriate option for individual hosts that need to securely access Azure resources but which only intermittently connect to on-premises networks.      
        - content: Site-To-Site VPN
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Site-To-Site VPN isn't an appropriate option for individual hosts that need to securely access Azure resources but which only intermittently connect to on-premises networks.      
        - content: Point-To-Site VPN
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Point-to-site VPNs are appropriate for individual hosts that need to securely access Azure resources but which only intermittently connect to on-premises networks.
