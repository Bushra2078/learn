quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which function returns the number of distinct values of a particular column?"
    choices:
    - content: "`count()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The `count()` function returns the number of rows in a table."
    - content: "`dcount()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `dcount()` function returns the number of distinct values of a particular column."
    - content: "`distinct()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The `distinct()` function returns a list of distinct values of a particular column."
  - content: "Which of the following can be used to summarize storm event data by week?"
    choices:
    - content: "`summarize ... by bin(StartTime, 7d)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `bin()` function groups a scattered set of values into a smaller set of specific values."
    - content: "`summarize ... by StartTime`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. This solution aggregates data by the start time but doesn't group it by week."
    - content: "`summarize ... by 1week`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Grouping `by `week` isn't a valid syntax."
  - content: "Which function can be used with the `summarize` operator to return the median of storm events per state?"
    choices:
    - content: "`avg()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The `avg()` function returns the average value (arithmetic mean) for each group."
    - content: "`max()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The `max()` function returns the maximum value for each group."
    - content: "`percentiles()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `percentiles()` function returns the frequency distribution for each group."
  - content: "Which of the following best describes the `let` statement?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `let` statement is useful for building complex expression and using them as part of a query."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The answer doesn't describe the `let` statement."
    - content: "The `let` statement is useful for breaking up a complex expression into multiple parts, defining constants outside of the query body for readability, or defining a variable once and using it multiple times within a query."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The answer accurately describes they key the `let` statement."
    - content: "The `let` statement are reusable subqueries that can be defined as part of the query itself (ad-hoc functions), or persisted as part of the database metadata (stored functions). They're invoked through a name, are provided with zero or more input arguments (which can be scalar or tabular), and produce a single value (which can be scalar or tabular) based on the `let` statement body."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The answer describes the difference between user-defined and stored functions, how they're invoked, and values they can return."
