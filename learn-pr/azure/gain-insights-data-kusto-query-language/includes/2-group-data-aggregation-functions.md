Organizations in all sectors deal with a constant flow of data and need to turn this data into meaningful, actionable insights. In the meteorological scenario, you've obtained a dataset with storm data from the US. In this module, you'll learn about the how to aggregate data using the Kusto Query Language (KQL) so that you can gain meaningful insights from this dataset.

## What is a Kusto query?

A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results. 

## What is an aggregate function?

The data in the storm events scenario is presented on an event level, meaning that each row represents a specific event and its associated information. It's easier to compare these events if you group them by certain fields, such as location, time, or event type. 

An aggregation function groups values of multiple rows to form a single summary value.

In the next units, we'll learn about some of the most common aggregation functions, and then build complex queries using the let statement to gain insights into a sample dataset containing US meteorological data.
