A Kusto query can be used to explore datasets and gain insights. We've used a meteorological dataset to compare the number of certain kinds of storm events in different US states for the year 2007, and visualized the results. Here, you'll explore other aggregate functions to describe the data.

## Characterize storm types using the `avg()` operator

In the last unit, you looked at the number of storms as a function of time and the damage caused by these storms. Let's look at other statistics that can help characterize the storms themselves.

First, you'll use the `avg()` operator to calculate the average damage caused by storms.

The following query creates a calculated column using the `extend` operator to add all values of damage, in this case *DamageProperty* and *DamageCrops*. The query then filters for events that caused damage greater than zero. Next, the query summarizes the average damage created by each type of storm. Finally, the results are sorted by the new average damage column.

1. Run the following query:

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | extend damage = DamageProperty + DamageCrops
    | where damage > 0
    | summarize avg(damage) by EventType
    | sort by avg_damage
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

1. Take a look at the results. Do they meet your expectations? Of the types of events listed in the left column, what would you expect to cause the most damage on average?

## Find extremes using `min()` and `max()`

Let's now look at the damage extremes.

For absolute maximum or minimum values, use the `max()` and `min()` aggregate operators. Define the column on which to calculate the max or min value, and the field on which to aggregate the data. The following query builds on the above calculated `damage` column, adding `max()` and `min()` values for the same column.

1. Run the following query:

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAwsuyS/KdS1LzSsp5qpRSK0oSc1LUUhJzE1MT1WwVXABMwKK8gtSi0oqFbShAs5AAZDy8ozUolSYajsFA6BQcWlubmJRZlWqQm5ihQZESlNHITczD8FJLEuHcRSSKhXAtodUFqSCtOcXlYDEgJrjIUoAF4POAqEAAAA=" target="_blank"> Click to run query</a>
    
    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | extend damage = DamageProperty + DamageCrops
    | where damage > 0
    | summarize max(damage), min(damage), avg(damage) by EventType
    | sort by max_damage
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-max.png" alt-text="Screenshot of max aggregate function results.":::

1. Take a look at the results. Notice that the output of the `max(damage)` operator has been named *max_damage*.

## Use the `percentiles()` operator

So far, you've calculated the min, max, and average values of damage caused by each event. To complete the picture of the distribution of these values, it can be useful to calculate the percentiles. Using the `percentiles()` operator, you can define the input data and the percentiles to calculate. In the following example, you'll calculate the 5th, 20th, 50th, 80th, and 95th percentile values of damage for each event type.

> [!NOTE]
> *Percentiles*, which represent a frequency distribution, should not be confused with *percentages*, which are a proportion of a whole.

1. Run the following query:

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAwsuyS/KdS1LzSsp5qpRSK0oSc1LUUhJzE1MT1WwVXABMwKK8gtSi0oqFbShAs5AAZDy8ozUolSYajsFA6BQcWlubmJRZlWqAlBLMtDYzJzUYg2IEh0FUx0FIwMgBcQWQGxpqqmQVKkAtj6ksiAVpD+/qARFTCGxOBkAk1m5yaUAAAA=" target="_blank"> Click to run query</a>

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | extend damage = DamageProperty + DamageCrops
    | where damage > 0
    | summarize percentiles(damage, 5, 20, 50, 80, 95) by EventType
    | sort by EventType asc
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

1. Take a look at the results. Can you identify the median damage caused by floods?
