Azure Active Directory (AD) allows you to add custom domain names. When they're added to Azure AD, your employees can use a memorable, and branded, user name to access your company's resources.

Your organization used Azure to develop, and test, a pilot project. It has now decided to make Azure available to the entire company. You're the organization's Global Administrator in Azure AD. You're going to set up accounts for all your employees to onboard them.

You want to create user names that are familiar to your users. Their Azure sign-in name needs to be memorable. Also, their Azure AD account should clearly be associated with your organization. You have a new custom domain name that your organization bought from a third-party domain name registrar. Before you create the user accounts, you want to add your organization's custom domain name to Azure AD.

This module explains how Azure AD supports custom domain names, and shows how to add them. The final unit discusses some common issues you might see and how to solve them.
