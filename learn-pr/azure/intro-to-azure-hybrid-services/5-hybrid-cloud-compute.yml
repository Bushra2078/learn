  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'As a part of their hybrid strategy, Tailwind Traders wants to manage container orchestration through the Azure portal instead of using on-premises tools. Which of the following hybrid-cloud compute technologies allows Tailwind Traders to accomplish this goal?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes is a container orchestration service that allows you to manage container orchestration through the Azure portal.'
    - content: 'Azure Stack HCI'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure Stack HCI is an on-premises hyperconverged virtualization host solution. While it’s possible to host a container orchestration solution on those virtual machines, Azure Stack HCI isn’t a container orchestration solution.'
    - content: 'Azure Arc enabled servers'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure Arc enabled servers are servers that exist outside the Azure IaaS environment and are connected to Azure, and for which Azure can provide some limited management functionality.'


  - content: 'As a part of their hybrid cloud strategy, Tailwind Traders wants to occasionally burst the calculations they perform on their high performance compute cluster onto a series of temporary Azure virtual machines. Which of the following technologies could they use to manage this process?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Azure Arc enabled servers.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure Arc enabled servers allows you to perform certain management tasks against on-premises servers. It does not allow you to manage high performance computing tasks and burst those tasks into Azure.'
    - content: 'Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes allows you to manage container orchestration in hybrid environments.'
    - content: 'Hybrid HPC.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Hybrid HPC allows an organization to burst High Performance Computing workloads onto temporary Azure virtual machines'
