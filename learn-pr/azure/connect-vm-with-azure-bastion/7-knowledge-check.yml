  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "An organization has set up virtual machines (VMs) to act as jumpboxes in each of their six virtual networks. Each of their jumpboxes regularly supports 5 concurrent RDP sessions per day. Why should they consider using Azure Bastion?"
    choices:
    - content: They could deploy one Bastion host to support all VM RDP connections in the resource group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bastion supports up to 25 concurrent RDP connects for VMs in the same virtual network or a peered virtual network. So if the virtual networks were peered they'd likely need at least two bastion hosts. 
    - content: They can eliminate all their VM management work.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bastion helps simplify the management of your internal VMs by providing a secure connection to those VMs over the internet.
    - content: They can reduce the number of VMs they manage by replacing each VM jumpbox with a bastion host. 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: They can deploy one bastion host to each virtual network or to peered virtual networks.
  - content: "At what resource level or scope does a Bastion deployment apply to?"
    choices:
    - content: Resource group
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Bastion deployment doesn't apply to the resource group scope.
    - content: Virtual network or peered virtual networks
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A Bastion host support RDP and SSH connections for VMs within the same virtual network or a peered virtual network.
    - content: Subscription
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Bastion deployment doesn't apply to the subscription scope.
  - content: "You decide to deploy Bastion to an existing virtual network by using Azure CLI. What resources do you need to create?"
    choices:
    - content: VM, public IP, and Bastion
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't need a VM to deploy Bastion to a virtual network.
    - content: Subnet named AzureBastionSubnet and at least one VM
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can't connect to the Bastion host without a public IP address.
    - content: Subnet named AzureBastionSubnet, public IP, and Bastion
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You need to create a subnet named AzureBastionSubnet for the virtual network; create a public IP; and then create the Bastion resource with the virtual network and public IP address information. 
  - content: "Several of your peers are having trouble connecting to VMs by using Bastion. Where might you start to troubleshoot the issue?"
    choices:
    - content: Check the public IP address.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Connectivity issues with the public IP address aren't likely to be the issue.
    - content: Review the number of current remote connections by going to **Bastion** > **Sessions**.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Bastion has a limit on the number of concurrent RDP and SSH connections it supports. Compare the number of sessions that are open for each protocol with the Bastion limits.
    - content: Review the rules in your network security group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Unless someone recently updated your network security group, the rules aren't likely the issue.
