  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "An organization has set up virtual machines (VMs) to act as jump boxes in each of their six virtual networks. Why should they consider using Azure Bastion?"
    choices:
    - content: They could deploy one Bastion host to support all VM connections in the subscription.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bastion supports connections to VMs in the same virtual network or a peered virtual network. 
    - content: They can eliminate all their VM management work.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bastion simplifies the management of your internal VMs by providing a secure connection to those VMs over the internet without having to install anything.
    - content: They can reduce the number of VMs they manage and make it easier to connect to the VMs. 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Bastion can replace a jump box VM solution that you're managing. Bastion provides a secure connection to VMs over the internet without having to install connection software like Remote Desktop.
  - content: "At what resource level or scope does a Bastion connection apply to?"
    choices:
    - content: Resource group
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Bastion deployment doesn't apply to the resource group scope.
    - content: Virtual network or peered virtual networks
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A Bastion host support RDP and SSH connections for VMs within the same virtual network or a peered virtual network.
    - content: Subscription
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A Bastion deployment doesn't apply to the subscription scope.
  - content: "You decide to deploy Bastion to an existing virtual network by using Azure CLI. What resources do you need to create?"
    choices:
    - content: VM, public IP, and Bastion
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't need a VM to deploy Bastion to a virtual network.
    - content: Subnet named AzureBastionSubnet and at least one VM
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can't connect to the Bastion host without a public IP address.
    - content: Subnet named AzureBastionSubnet, public IP, and Bastion
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You need to create a subnet named AzureBastionSubnet for the virtual network; create a public IP; and then create the Bastion resource with the virtual network and public IP address information. 
  - content: "Several of your peers are having trouble connecting to VMs by using Bastion. What isn't likely to cause the issue?"
    choices:
    - content: The public IP address of the destination VM
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You connect to internal VMs by using the public IP of Bastion not a public IP on the destination VM.
    - content: The number of current remote connections
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bastion has a limit on the number of concurrent RDP and SSH connections it supports. Compare the number of sessions that are open for each protocol with the Bastion limits.
    - content: Network security group rules
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Check to see if someone recently updated your network security group rules and compare the rules with the network access requirements for Bastion.
  - content: "You want to add an extra layer of security to Bastion. Where can you start?"
    choices:
    - content: Deny all inbound TCP network traffic to the Bastion public IP
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: For Bastion to work, your network security group needs to allow TCP access from the internet and from Azure Gateway Manager on ports 443 or 4443 to the Bastion public IP.
    - content: Apply the least privilege role-based access controls (RBAC) to use and manage Bastion
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Use Azure RBAC to apply the least privilege to use Bastion. Apply just the reader role on the Bastion resource, on the virtual machine, and on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
    - content: Remove the reader role on the Azure Bastion resource for all users
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: For you to connect to the VM resource by using Bastion, you must have the reader role on the Bastion resource. You also need the reader role on the virtual machine, and on the NIC with private IP of the virtual machine.
