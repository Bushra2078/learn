Tailwind Traders is now facing competitive pressure for its products from startups that have entered the online retail market. Early customer feedback indicates that these new entities offer a much better online experience than Tailwind Traders does. 

Industry trends show that the growth of the online market is higher than the brick-and-mortar business. So, Tailwind Traders has reprioritized innovation efforts to reshape its digital presence and e-commerce platforms.

One obstacle is the large effort that the existing applications require to introduce modifications. Besides, Tailwind Traders' experience shows that application changes often result in application downtime and a reduced customer experience. 

The change rate has traditionally been slow for Tailwind Traders' applications. The new competitive threats in the e-commerce sector demand a much higher innovation speed and as much uptime as possible.

After migrating the on-premises applications to Azure with a lift-and-shift process, Tailwind Traders wants to rearchitect them. The goal is to reach the required innovation rate that will allow for the company to survive in the new competitive ecosystem.
