Tailwind Traders is now facing competitive pressure for its products from startups that have entered the online retail market. Preliminary customer feedback indicates that these new entities offer a much better online experience than Tailwind Traders, and that the growth of the online market is substantially higher than the brick and mortar business. As a consequence, Tailwind Traders has reprioritized innovation efforts to reshape its digital presence and e-commerce platforms.

One obstacle is the large efforts that the existing applications require to introduce modifications. Besides, Tailwind Traders experience shows that application changes often result in application downtime, and a subsequently reduced customer experience. Hence, the change rate has traditionally been slow for Tailwind Traders applications. However, the new competitive threats in the e-commerce sector demand a much higher innovation speed and as much uptime as possible.

After migrating the on-premises applications to Azure with a lift-and-shift process, Tailwind Traders is aiming at re-architect them to achieve the required innovation rate that will allow for the company to survive in the new competitive ecosystem.
