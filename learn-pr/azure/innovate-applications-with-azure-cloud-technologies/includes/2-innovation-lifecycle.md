Tailwind Traders is confronted with questions about innovation that affect many other organizations too:

- How to increase the rate of change without impacting the running business?
- How to decide where to innovate and what changes to implement, to maximize the increase in value?

These questions are related: the answer to both of them is that Tailwind Traders needs to embrace change as part of its organization culture. One reason why change-averse organizations are frequently hit by outages involving changes, is because those changes are too large and impactful, and hence difficult to test in controlled and realistic environments. If processes are established to introduce changes frequently, those changes will be smaller in size and risk. Note that this process does not just involve adopting certain tools or technologies, but it requires a cultural changes that fosters change and accepts failures.

The concept of accepting failure might seem counter intuitive, but it is vital to the innovation cycle. If individuals are afraid to fail because errors will put them at the center of endless blame games, new approaches to problem solving will likely not be pursued in the fear of failure, and the whole organization will be prisoner of its own practices. If on the contrary a "fail fast" culture can be established where individuals are encouraged to try out new things, and they are empowered to quickly change direction if they do not bring the expected outcome, a much richer innovation culture will be created.

## Hypothesis-based Innovation

Innovation can be described as a hypothesis-based cycle. Upon identifying the existence of a problem, one or more hypothesis can be formulated that can potentially explain the root cause and lead to the solution. The definition of the problem itself can be challenging, since it needs to be measurable. For example, the problem definition "customers are not happy with our payment platform choice" is not measurable, so it will be difficult to solve. However, if the problem can be defined as "23% of customers leave their shopping session at the step of choosing the payment platform", you are in a much better position to measure the success of any possible solution.

After defining a problem in a measurable way, hypothesis can be formulated that are candidates to solving the problem. For example, a hypothesis in Tailwind Traders could be described as "Adding ContosoPay to our supported payment platforms would decrease customer churn at the payment page from 23% to 10%". Now there is an idea on the table, and it is a matter of verifying its accuracy.

Note that hypothesis should focus on adding value to customers, and hence improving their experience in their interactions with your organizations. That is often known as "customer empathy": placing your customer at the center of your innovation, and focusing on increasing value for them, as well as to you.

There are many ways of validating a hypothesis without actually touching application code: customer surveys and market research are two examples of valuable information sources that can help to decide the validity of certain hypothesis. Checking these sources will allow to qualify your hypothesis, and actually build those with highest likelihood of accuracy and added value.

### Build

Once a hypothesis has enough value potential to be built into your application, the build process starts. Note that here again the speed is crucial. Your development sprints should be as quick as possible, to allow quick verification or rejection of the hypothesis, or to fine tune the way in which the required functionality is to be integrated in the application. This will result in quicker innovation cycles.

### Measure

You want to verify the accuracy of your hypothesis as soon as possible. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a preliminary version of the new functionality, that offers just enough functionality to gather feedback that confirms whether you are moving in the right direction.

The goal of the MVP is not only verifying your hypothesis, but any assumptions you might have taken too. For example, if 23% of Tailwind Traders customers leave the purchasing process at the payment page, they are assuming that the reason is because they are not offering enough payment platforms. However, the reason might be different, and the MVP should be designed to confirm or reject these assumptions as well as the hypothesis.

### Learn

This phase is very similar to the start of the process: after learning more about your assumptions or hypothesis, you might find out that they were right, partially right, or wrong altogether. Having a growth mindset and enough humility to admit failures will allow you to quickly pivot if you need, to continue working on your MVP, or to refocus your efforts in other areas and formulate alternative hypothesis.

It is important realizing that even if your hypothesis and assumptions were wrong, the process has allowed you to learn something new about your customers and your business. Hence, it should not be seen as wasted time. The key is gaining that new knowledge as soon as possible, the core of the fail-fast culture.
