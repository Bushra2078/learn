- After building the new feature (new payment platform) in the Tailwind Traders e-commerce application, the hypothesis can be validated or rejected: is the customer experience better now?
- Controlled deployment
    - Feature flags, feature rings and canary deployments allow to release the feature to a limited set of users, to prevent disrupting the experience of the whole customer base
    - Portal options for users to decide if they want to be exposed to new functionality or not puts the user in control of their own experience
- Application Insights allow to measure if users are reacting positively or negatively to a new feature.
    - Tailwind Traders has released the new payment option to 10% of the users
    - Application Insights shows that the feature is working without incidents
    - However, only 1% of the users with the feature are using the new payment option, so the hypothesis that this feature would bring a significant business value increase has to be rejected
