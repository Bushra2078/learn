In this module, you have learnt how Azure technologies can support you along the innovation cycle Build-Measure-Learn:

- DevOps practices and modern application technologies reduce the duration of the innovation cycle loops, to accelerate business value creation.
- Data obtained from the application allows you to analyze whether innovation hypotheses are correct, partially correct, or false. It also allows you to correlate technical aspects of the application to business metrics.
- Data democratization makes sure that the collected data is used to learn from the innovation cycle, and a growth mindset culture spreads across your organization.

Tailwind Traders is using Azure to power their innovation engine in multiple ways:

- Azure DevOps allows Tailwind Traders to introduce application changes frequently and reliably.
- The e-commerce platform will be re-engineered into a microservices architecture to facilitate introducing changes.
- Tailwind Traders will containerize the microservices of the e-commerce platform, and deploy them on Azure Kubernetes Services.
- Tailwind Traders decided to use Azure Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies to enrich their applications with a chat for customers to open support cases, a modern product search portal and a recommendation engine that suggests additional offers to registered users.
- The e-commerce web site has been equipped with Azure Application Insights telemetry, which allows Tailwind Traders to gather data on the utilization of new features to confirm or reject hypotheses about the business value added by each innovation.
- Microsoft Power BI is used to disseminate data across the Tailwind Traders organization to ensure that  decisions are data-driven, and a growth mindset becomes pervasive.
- This data-driven decision process allows Tailwind Traders to formulate, build, and verify innovation hypotheses quickly to continue improving their customer experience and business impact.
