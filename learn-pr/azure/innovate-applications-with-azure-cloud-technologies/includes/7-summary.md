Tailwind Traders is using Azure to power their innovation engine:

- Azure DevOps allows Tailwind Traders to introduce application changes frequently and reliably
- The e-commerce platform has been reengineered into a microservices architecture to facilitate change introduction
- For this specific application Tailwind Traders decided to containerize each microservice and deploy it on Azure Kubernetes Services
- Tailwind Traders decided to use Azure technologies to enrich their ecommerce platforms with a chat for customers to provide feedback and ask questions, a modern product search engine and a recommendation engine that suggests additional products to registered users
- The ecommerce microservices are equipped with Azure Application Insights telemetry, which allows Tailwind Traders to gather utilization usage for new features, to confirm or reject hypothesis about the business value added by each innovation
- Analysis of the learnt information allows Tailwind Traders to formulate new hypothesis and restart the innovation cycle to keep improving their customer experience
