In this unit, you'll learn the importance of machine learning and artificial technologies in the innovation process and customer experience.

## Machine learning and AI to create value

When evaluating which application features are going to enhance the user experience and thus increase business value, machine learning (ML) and AI are great assets to improve the interaction with your customers and partners.

In addition to the transformation of its main e-commerce applications into a microservices architecture, Tailwind Traders is evaluating introducing new functionality that enhances the customer experience. Tailwind Traders has no data science skills. New staff will be hired in the future, but in the meantime, quick wins should be identified that can help in improving the competitiveness of the company's web shop. Four possibilities are being evaluated:

- Embedding a recommendation engine to increase cross sales
- Including a support chat to improve the user experience when problems arise
- Redesign the search engine to shorten the time it takes customers to find products
- Analyze product reviews to better understand customer's sentiment

Tailwind Traders needs to evaluate which Azure technologies can help the company to start its journey into infusing its applications with machine learning and AI.

## Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Azure

Azure offers some tools and services that can help organizations to build machine learning and artificial intelligence functionality in its applications quicker and at a lower cost.

### Azure Cognitive Services

[Azure Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services?azure-portal=true) are pre-built models that do not require machine learning expertise to introduce AI functionality to an application. Encompassing many different areas such as vision, speech, language, decision, and search, Azure Cognitive Services are easy to use, so organizations without extensive machine learning skills can use the power of AI too.

Tailwind Traders sees a high potential in Azure Cognitive Services, since its data science department is not fully operational yet. These are the services that will be evaluated to innovate the e-commerce application:

- **Personalizer**: this service can be used to learn which users prefer which products, and make fine-tuned, individual recommendations. Some customers will prefer products with quick delivery, others products on sale. Personalizer uses a type of Machine Learning algorithms called Reinforcement Learning, which does not require huge amounts of data to be trained. This is interesting for Tailwind Traders, since that data does not exist yet.
- **Text Analytics**: many users write product reviews that could be analyzed, to find dissatisfied customers that express negative sentiments. Focusing on these customers would reduce customer churn, and increase loyalty.
- **Translator**: product reviews can be an effective sales tool, unfortunately they can only be leveraged by customers that understand the language they are written in. Using real-time translation services would allow Tailwind Traders to show product reviews to any user, independently of their native language.

There are other Azure Cognitive Services that have potential for Tailwind Traders, but the company decided to start with the previous three. The reason is the positive ratio between the potential increase business impact and the low effort that their introduction would require.

### Knowledge Mining and Azure Cognitive Search

[Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search?azure-portal=true) powers the introduction of knowledge mining and flexible search engines into applications with little coding effort. Not only can it index massive amount of data, but it can add enrichments using Azure Cognitive Services to augment the information available to search.

One of the areas where the Tailwind Traders application needs to be improved is the product search. Customers reportedly spend too long trying to find the product they are looking for. Replacing the existing search engine with Azure Cognitive Search will allow you to expose rich search controls such as faceted navigation (multi category filters), relevance tuning and autocomplete.

Internet users are used to sophisticated search engines, so Tailwind Traders cannot afford to continue offering the existing, old-fashioned functionality in the present version of the e-commerce platform. Fortunately, Azure Cognitive Search is offered as a set of APIs that is easy to use, and will allow creating a Minimum Viable Product quickly.

### Azure Conversational AI and Azure Bot Services

The next area where surveys have surfaced user dissatisfaction is in customer support. Long resolution times and congested phone lines are the two complaints being mentioned most frequently.

Tailwind Traders is considering [Azure Bot Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service?azure-portal=true) to implement a chat-based support system with which users can resolve their issues quicker, at a lower cost, and a better user experience. Azure Bot Services can be implemented using different languages like C#, JavaScript and Python. This makes it easier finding developers in the organization that can use a familiar programming language to create the new support chat functionality.

Azure Bot Services can be implemented in various channels, but Tailwind Traders is mostly interested in offering it as a web-based chat for users visiting the e-commerce web site.

### Azure Machine Learning

[Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-ml?azure-portal=true) facilitates the process of creating custom Machine Learning models, deploying those models to production, and manage different versions of all deployed models across the organization.

Azure Machine Learning makes the job of data scientists easier, by helping them to share experiment results and manage different models at scale. It can refine models with hyperparameter tuning and even create new ones with automated learning. Moreover, it can then deploy the selected models to Kubernetes clusters to offer highly scalable, enterprise-grade APIs that will run the organization's machine learning models in production.

Tailwind Traders is considering using custom models for a next-generation product recommender that would be more sophisticated than the Recommender Azure Cognitive Service, but this will be possible only when data science expertise exists in the organization.

## Tailwind Traders Analysis

Tailwind Traders has formulated the hypothesis "A recommendation engine would increase cross sales". Ideally, Azure Machine Learning Services could be used to build a recommendation engine purpose-built for the organization needs. However, Tailwind Traders has no data science expertise at the moment.

Tailwind Traders has decided to use the Personalizer Azure Cognitive Service to enrich the application without the need for data scientists for the time being.

If the hypothesis is validated, the data science team that is currently being built would evolve the prototype with custom-built Machine Learning models built with Azure. An example is in [Build a Real-time Recommendation API on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/ai/real-time-recommendation?azure-portal=true).

Additionally, Tailwind Traders has decided to validate the existing hypothesis around building a support chat with the Azure Bot Service, and improving the e-commerce site with Azure Cognitive Search. Both prototypes can be built with relatively low effort, so that Tailwind Traders starts its foray into machine learning and AI at full speed.
