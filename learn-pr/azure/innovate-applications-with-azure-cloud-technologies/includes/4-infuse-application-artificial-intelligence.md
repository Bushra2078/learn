When evaluating which application features are going to enhance the customer experience and thus increase business value, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a great asset to improve the interaction with customers and partners:

- Azure offer different services around Artificial Intelligence:
    - Azure Cognitive Services are pre-built models that do not require machine learning expertise to introduce AI functionality to an application
    - Azure Machine Learning Services facilitate the process of creating custom models, deploying those models to production, and manage different versions of all deployed models across the organization
    - Azure Cognitive Search powers the introduction of knowledge mining and flexible search engines into applications with little effort
    - Azure Bot Services can be used to extend the user interaction, for example by including chat capabilities in web sites
- For example, if the hypothesis "A recommendation engine would increase cross sales" is formulated, the Azure Cognitive Service Personalizer could be used to enrich the application without the need for data science expertise
- If the hypothesis were confirmed, the functionality could be enriched with Azure Machine Learning Services (example in (Build a Real-time Recommendation API on Azure)[https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/ai/real-time-recommendation])
- Tailwind Traders is planning to introduce a more flexible, faceted product search engine in their ecommerce platform, as well as a chat-based support agent for customers that have questions around products
