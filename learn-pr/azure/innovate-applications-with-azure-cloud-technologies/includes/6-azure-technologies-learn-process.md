In this unit you will learn how to leverage the results of the Measure step in the innovation lifecycle process.

## Data Culture

As you have learnt in previous units, you can collect data from your customers using multiple sources, such as micro surveys, utilization data derived by Azure Application Insights or feature flags that customers can decide on their own to enable or disable. The more data you have, the better your decisions will be. However, you need to have a way of handling this ever increasing data.

Already in 2014 [Satya Nadella talked](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2014/04/15/a-data-culture-for-everyone/) about the importance of the data culture in an organization. Decisions should not be made based on feelings or subjective opinions, but using data to validate them. Data should be available to every individual that needs it, and it should be easily converted into actionable insights to facilitate data-driven decisions.

## PowerBI

[Microsoft Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview) is a set of tools that consolidate data coming from disparate sources into integrated, interactive visualizations. Users can dive in the data just by operating intuitive controls, so that the power of insights is reachable by everybody in an organization, and not only by data professionals.

Area owners can create reports and dashboards that contain the relevant information around specific aspects of the application, so that after introducing new functionality to validate a hypothesis, data is readily available to either validate or reject the hypothesis based on real customer usage.

## Growth Mindset

The learn phase sometimes delivers bad news. Hypothesis that we thought to be right turn out not to be correct. Being open for alternative ideas is key for the innovation process to flow smoothly. Maybe they whole hypothesis was wrong, or maybe only the way in which the prototype was developed. In any case, conclusions should always be backed by data, and the team should move on to formulating the next hypothesis, possibly some kind of revision or iteration of the initial one.

A possibility is that existing data does not allow to unequivocally conclude whether the hypothesis was right or wrong. In this case, the data set helping to the decision process should be enhanced, either introducing new telemetry points in the application, or figuring out new ways of getting information about the customer experience.
