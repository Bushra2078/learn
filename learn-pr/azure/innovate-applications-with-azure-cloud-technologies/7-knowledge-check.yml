  questions:

  - content: "What are the main phases of the innovation lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: The Waterfall Process
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The waterfall process is typically considered too slow to result in an agile innovation lifecycle."
    - content: Build - Measure - Learn
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This iterative process is the basis framework to run progressive innovations."
    - content: Crawl - Walk - Run
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although progressively increasing functionality and complexity is typically a good idea, it isn't necessarily related to the innovation process."

  - content: "Why are microservices architecture often associated with innovation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because microservices architectures are more secure than monolithic software."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Security isn't the main differentiator between microservices and monolithic architectures, but the way in which different application modules interact with each other."
    - content: "Because they're based in Kubernetes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although microservices architectures are often based in containerized software, it isn't a requirement."
    - content: "Because they enable introducing new functionality in one microservice without impacting the rest."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Being able to innovate on one microservice without having to touch the rest, new functionality can be implemented quickly."

  - content: "Why is adopting a DevOps culture critical to enable effective innovation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because it enables testing in production."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually DevOps means the opposite direction: testing as early in the development process as possible, thus making software rollouts a safer practice."
    - content: "Because it uses GitHub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although GitHub is a great tool to support your DevOps process, the tool is not the most important criteria when adopting a DevOps culture in an organization."
    - content: "Because it enables bringing new functionality to applications both quickly and reliably."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Deploying new features quickly and reliably allows you to validate or reject innovation hypothesis faster and more efficiently."

  - content: "Is Kubernetes a requirement to innovate an application?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, but containerization can make the build step faster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Application containerization isn't essential for innovation. However, it can ease testing and validation of new application code. As a consequence, it accelerates the innovation process."
    - content: "Yes, only containerized applications can be innovated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although containerization does ease testing and validation of new application code, non-containerized code can be innovated as well."
    - content: No, because Kubernetes increases the operational complexity for an application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although it is true that Kubernetes introduces a certain operational complexity, containerization does accelerate the process of application development."

  - content: "Is it possible to build Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence functionality in an application without data scientists?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes, with Azure Kubernetes Services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While Azure Kubernetes Service can help in the build process, and it can run any containerized application including ML and AI, it is not essential to enrich an application with AI."
    - content: "Yes, with pre-built models such as Azure Cognitive Services."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Cognitive Services are pre-built APIs ready to be embedded into any application without requiring data science skills."
    - content: "No, a data science department is always required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it is true that data scientists can build powerful models adapted to each organization's needs, there are other options in case no data science expertise is available."

  - content: "Which Azure service allows to extract telemetry information from user activity to validate or reject innovation hypothesis?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure DevOps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure DevOps is a great tool to support your DevOps process, but it does not include Application Performance Management functionality."
    - content: "Azure Application Services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Application Services is a great platform to run web-based applications, but it does not include reporting of application telemetry."
    - content: "Azure Application Insights."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Application Insights can track how customers use applications, how the application performs, and detect anomalies in the application performance."

  - content: "Why is data democratization critical for innovation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because everybody can use spreadsheets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although spreadsheets are common for data analysis, they're not great to share and democratize data."
    - content: "Because hypothesis validation should be data-driven."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Ideally all decisions in an organization should be driven by data, including the innovation process."
    - content: "Because machine learning is the future."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although machine learning can uncover hidden data correlations, data-driven decisions don't need to be supported by sophisticated algorithms to be effective."
