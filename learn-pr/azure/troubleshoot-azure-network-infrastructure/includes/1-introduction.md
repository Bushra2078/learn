**1. Introduction**

You are the Azure architect for an engineering company. One of your colleagues has deployed a VM in Azure and is having network connectivity issues. You are the Azure architect for the project, so they have come to you for help. You have worked through these issues in the past. You want to help your colleague learn how they can troubleshoot these issues themselves if they come up in the future. You take them through the tools in Azure Network Watcher to help them identify and remediate the issues. You provide your colleagues with use case scenarios for the Azure Network Watcher, discuss on which tools and how the tools are used to resolve the issue. These scenarios are a great way of teaching your colleagues how they can use Azure Network Watcher to troubleshoot.

In this module, you will learn about the facilities within Network Watcher and use them to diagnose a communication problem between two VMs. There will also be 2 exercises in the module,using the Network Watcher monitor and diagnostic  tools to diagnose and troubleshoot VM issue. Engineers can use Azure Network Watcher to monitor, diagnose, and gain insight into their network health and performance with metrics. The features can be broken down into four areas: monitoring, network diagnostic tools, metrics, and logs. 
 By the end of this module, you will be able to identify which Network Watcher tools you can use to diagnose and troubleshoot connectivity problems.
