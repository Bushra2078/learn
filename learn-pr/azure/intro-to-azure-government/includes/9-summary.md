In this module, we learned about Azure Government, the sovereign cloud built specifically for the US Government. Whether you are creating solutions for Federal, state, or local government, you can take advantage of the world-class security, protection, and compliance of Azure Government. 

In addition to the large set of compliant services offered by Azure Government, you can also deploy pre-built images from Microsoft and its partners through the Azure Government marketplace. If you are already familiar with global Azure, you will have a similar experience when you connect to Azure Government.
