## Motivation

Azure is a cloud platform that provides the compute, storage, and networking resources needed to build cloud-hosted applications. As a new user, the Azure Portal is likely to be the primary way you will interact with Azure. The Portal lets you create and manage all your Azure resources. For example, you can set up a new database, increase the compute power of your Virtual Machines, and monitor your monthly costs. It's also a great learning tool since you can survey all available resources and use guided wizards to create the ones you need.

Here, you will learn how to create an Azure account, sign in to the Portal, and navigate the Portal interface. You will customize the dashboard, so it is convenient to locate and monitor your most-important services.
