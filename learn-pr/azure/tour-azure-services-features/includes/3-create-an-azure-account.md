## What is an Azure account?

An _Azure account_ is a container that holds information about your organization and the Azure resources you have provisioned. Specifically, it stores:

- identity information like name and contact preferences
- billing information such as a credit card
- details of all your resources like Virtual Machines, databases, etc.

## Azure Account Types

Azure has a number of account types that cater for differing customer types. The most commonly-used accounts are:

- Free
- Pay-As-You-Go
- Enterprise Agreement

### Azure free account

An Azure free account includes $200 credit to spend for the first 30 days, free access to the most popular Azure products for 12 months, and access to more than 25 products that are always free. This is a great way for new users to get started. To set up a free account, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft account.

### Azure Pay-As-You-Go account

A Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) account bills you monthly for the services you used. This account type is appropriate for a wide range of users, from individuals and small businesses and many large organizations as well.

### Azure Enterprise Agreement

An Enterprise Agreement provides flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement with discounts for new licenses and Software Assurance. It is targeted at enterprise-scale organizations.

## Summary

Whether you are an individual, a small business, or an enterprise, you need an account in order to use Azure services. The typical sequence is to start with a free account so you can evaluate Azure services. When your trial period expires, you will convert from the free account to Pay-As-You-Go.
