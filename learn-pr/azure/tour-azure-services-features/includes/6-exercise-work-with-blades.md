# Exercise - Work with blades

In this exercise, you will learn how to work with blades in the Azure Portal User Interface (UI).

## Log on to Azure

1. In a browser, navigate to https://portal.azure.com, and sign in.

2. In the left-hand pane, click **Security Center**.

3. Click **Getting started**.

4. Click **Implement security recommendations**. This link takes you to [Managing security recommendations in Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-recommendations), where you can see a list of security recommendations for using Azure. When you have reviewed this information, close the new browser tab.

## Working with Blades

5. To start creating a resource, in the left-hand pane, click **Create a resource**.

6. The **New** blade displays a list of categories of items to create on the left-hand side, with the **Get started** option selected. This is like the "Favorites" menu, with some of the most common options showing. Under **Get started**, you have the option to create resources such as a Windows Server 2016 VM, an Ubuntu Server VM, a Web app, a SQL database, and so on. Each of these items includes a Quickstart tutorial.

7. Click **Quickstart tutorial** under Windows Server 2016 VM. This link takes you to [Windows Virtual Machines Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/), which lists the Windows VM tutorials. Close this new tab to return to the Azure portal.

## Viewing Resources

8. Under Azure Marketplace, click **Compute** to show more compute options, such as Red Hat Enterprise, Reserved VM instances, Web app for Containers, and so on. However, this list is still a sub-set of the entire range of compute resources available.

9. To the right of **Featured**, click **See all** to see the full range of available resources. The full list of VMs now appears.

10. Under **Recommended**, click **Windows Server**. The **Windows Server** blade appears.

11. To the right of the Pin icon, click the Maximize icon. The Windows Server blade now fills the screen, except for the left-hand pane. Scroll down the list to see the other Windows Server images available.

12. Click the X at the top right-hand corner to close the **Windows Server** blade.

## Filtering Results

13. To refine this list further, in the **Compute** blade, click **Filter**. The **Filter** blade now appears.

14. Check the option for **Virtual Machines**, and then click **Done**.

15. Click the X in the top right-hand corner of the **Filter** blade.

16. In the Compute blade, look down the list of available VM images, then at the bottom, click **Load More**.

17. Continue to click **Load More** a few times to appreciate just how many types of VM that Azure provides.

18. Click the X at the top right-hand corner to close the **Compute** blade.

19. Click the X at the top right-hand corner to close the **Marketplace** blade.

20. Click the X at the top right-hand corner to close the **New** blade.

The default Dashboard now appears.

## Summary
