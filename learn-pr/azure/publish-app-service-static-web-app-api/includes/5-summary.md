Static web apps contain assets of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and images. It's ideal to serve the web assets by putting them close to your users. You must also solve how to make API calls, secure your web app, and automate the build and deployment of your web app.

In this tutorial, you created, modified, and published a web app that has all of these features and benefits.

Without Azure Static Web Apps, you could deploy your web assets to cloud storage, create and assign your own SSL certificate, create your API, establish a reverse proxy that allows your app to make calls to the API, distribute the app globally, and set up your own CI/CD process.

When you use Azure Static Web Apps, you get all of this out of the box.
