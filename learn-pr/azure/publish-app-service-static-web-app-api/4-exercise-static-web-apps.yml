      choices:
        - content: "Delete the Azure Static Web Apps instance and recreate it."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Azure Static Web Apps instance doesn't need to be recreated to redeploy changes to your web app."
        - content: "Push commits to the watched branch or create pull request to the watched branch."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Every time you push commits or create pull requests into the watched branch, the GitHub Action automatically builds and deploys your app to Azure."
        - content: "Create a new GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish your web app."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The existing GitHub Actions workflow is capable of redeploying your web app."
        - content: "Create and push a new branch to your git repository."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A new branch will not be watched by the existing GitHub Actions workflow."
    - content: "How do you view the progress of building and redeploying after you make changes to your app?"
      choices:
        - content: "Go to the production URL of your app."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The production URL of your Azure Static Web Apps instance displays your web app, not your build progress."
        - content: "Go to your resource in the Azure portal and view the configuration."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The configuration for your resource in the Azure portal allows you to view or modify the configuration of the resource. It does not show the progress of your build and redeployment of your web app."
        - content: "Push your commits to the watched branch of your git repository."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Pushing your commits will not show your progress, but it will trigger a GitHub Actions workflow."
        - content: "Go to the repository on `github.com`, then navigate to the Actions menu."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You can view the progress of the GitHub Actions workflow in your browser on your repository."
