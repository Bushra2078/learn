Microsoft Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) allow you to specify your project's infrastructure in a declarative and reusable way. The templates can be versioned and saved in the same source control as your development project.

Suppose you're managing a software team that's developing an inventory system for your partner companies. You plan to deploy this product to Azure, and each partner company will have its own solution. Different policies for each deployment will be implemented through different Azure storage accounts. You decide to use the practice of *infrastructure as code* by using ARM templates. This approach lets you track the different versions and ensure that your infrastructure deployments for each environment are consistent and flexible.

In this module, you're introduced to ARM template structure. You also practice creating and deploying an ARM template to Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Use Visual Studio Code to create an ARM template.
- Declare resources and add flexibility to your template by adding parameters and outputs.

## Prerequisites
