Modern organizations must be able to release apps quickly to attract and retain business. This requirement forces software development and support teams to always looking at solutions that saves time and reduces costs. An ideal solution has to reduce the time spent on the creation and configuration of deployment environments and the simplification of the software deployment process.

The idea of using containerization technology as a time-saving and cost reduction solution is popular. One of the primary propositions of containerization is that that you don't have to configure hardware and spend time installing operating systems and software to host a deployment. Also, multiple apps can run in their isolated containers on the same device.

Suppose you work for an online clothing retailer that is planning the development of several internal apps. Your team develops and tests all applications on-premises and then deployment them to Azure for pre-production testing and final production hosting.  You're looking for maximum compatibility in each environment with little or no configuration changes, and using Docker as a containerization solution seems an ideal choice.

Here, you'll see how the Docker is used to create containers and learn a little bit how the Docker infrastructure work behind the scenes. The goal is to help you decide if Docker containers are the right choice for your business.
