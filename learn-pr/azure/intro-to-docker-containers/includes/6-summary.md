Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Docker containers would be the right choice for your business process. We looked at the benefits that Docker containers introduce:

1. Portability

1. Ease of management

1. Consistent delivery

1. More workloads same hardware

We saw that when we use Docker containers, we have to think about the container's runtime infrastructure. We discussed both storage and network configuration. These two aspects are changing in nature because of the portability of containers. As a result, both impact the software running in a container.

You were looking for a containerization solution that provides maximum compatibility in each environment with little or no configuration changes. We found that Docker is a good solution that enables us to create a snapshot of our application and all its dependencies.  We then deploy this same snapshot in development, testing, and production.

Finally, Azure provides various deployment options to host Docker containers. In Azure, containers can be integrated with other Azure services to extend your product or exchange data with other services.
