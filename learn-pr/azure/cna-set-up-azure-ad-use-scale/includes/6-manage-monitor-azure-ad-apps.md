Now that you've implemented your first Azure AD-integrated application, you plan to explore more in-depth aspects of its functionality that focus on management and maintenance tasks. You also want to ensure that you identify any additional caveats about multitenant applications.

## What are common management and maintenance tasks related to Azure AD-integrated apps?

Implementing Azure AD-integrated apps warrants the following special considerations, some of which might require additional management and maintenance tasks:

- Keep track of all redirect Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) associated with your applications, including the corresponding Domain Name Service (DNS) records.
- Protect web apps by ensuring that redirect URIs correspond to encrypted endpoints.
- Maintain credentials for web apps, web APIs, and daemon apps.
- When using secrets, consider automating their management, including their rotation.
- Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring the permission scope of your applications. Applications should request additional permissions only when required.
- Whenever possible, use delegated permissions rather than application permissions.
- During development, use the Microsoft Authentication Library rather than programming directly against protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and Open ID.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Microsoft Authentication Library offers an easy-to-use approach for implementing a wide range of authentication scenarios, including Conditional Access, device-wide single sign-on (SSO), and token caching.

## What are additional considerations related to multitenant Azure AD-integrated apps?

When implementing Azure AD multitenant scenarios, you need to configure your application to accept sign-ins from any Azure AD tenant. Users in those tenants will be able to access the app after they grant relevant consent requested by your app.

There are four primary elements required as part of implementing a multitenant app:

- Registering the app to be multitenant
- Configuring the app to send requests to the **/common** endpoint
- Adding code to manage multiple issuer values
- Including provisions to respond to user and admin consent

### Register the app to be multitenant

You can register your app as multitenant by setting the **Supported account types** option on the **Register an application** blade in the Azure portal to **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)**.

Azure AD requires the App ID URI of the app to be globally unique. For a single-tenant app, the App ID URI must be unique within that tenant. For a multitenant app, it must be globally unique. To satisfy this requirement, the host name of App ID URI needs to match a verified domain of the Azure AD tenant.

### Configure the app to send requests to the **/common** endpoint

In a single-tenant app, sign-in requests are sent to the tenant's sign-in endpoint. For example, for **contoso.com**, the corresponding endpoint is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com`. Effectively, requests targeting that endpoint allow sign-in of users or guests to the corresponding Azure AD tenant. With a multitenant app, you can't determine ahead of time which tenant will be used, so you need to use the `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common` endpoint, which serves all Azure AD tenants.

### Add code to manage multiple issuer values

Web applications and web APIs must be able to validate tokens from the Microsoft identity platform. This requires implementing logic that decides which issuer values are valid and which aren't, based on the tenant ID portion of the issuer value. For more detail, refer to the documentation referenced in the summary unit of this course.

### Include provisions to respond to user and admin consent

For a multitenant application, the initial registration of an app takes place in the Azure AD tenant used by the app developer. When individual users from different Azure AD tenants sign in to the app for the first time, each of them would be prompted to consent to the permissions requested by the application. This, in turn, would result in the creation of a service principal in their respective tenants. For details about provisions to address this requirement, refer to the documentation referenced in the summary unit of this course.
