You are an Azure subscription owner within the organization Contoso. Your team has been using Azure for several years and currently is utilizing 200 VMs on a monthly basis that are split across both your production and test environments. Currently, you are paying for these VMs on a monthly pay as you go basis.  

You have customers utilizing Contoso services that have been deployed to the production VMs and they have signed 1 year contracts to use the service. As such, you plan to use your existing production capacity for at least that long. When analyzing your bill, youâ€™ve realized that the compute costs in your production environment are leaving little room for investments in new product development. You are interested in lowering the overall yearly cost of this environment to free up additional funds for future development work. 

While you are aware that cost cuts must be made, you also realize that you cannot make changes to the existing capacity that is deployed. You want to understand how purchases can help you save money, determine what purchase to buy and how to make a purchase in the Azure Portal. Once you have made your purchase you would also like to know how to manage that purchase on an ongoing basis to further optimize your costs. You also must provide status and reporting on the savings that Contoso receives to your CEO and the finance team to help justify the purchase as funds are reallocated to new development work.
