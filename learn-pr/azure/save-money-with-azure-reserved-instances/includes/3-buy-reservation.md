This unit describes who can buy a reservation, how reservations are scoped, how to make a purchase, and who gets notifications for purchases.

## Who can buy a reservation?

To buy a plan, you must have a subscription owner or reservation purchaser role for a subscription. Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Customer Agreement billing admins (owners and contributors) can use the reservation purchase experience to give themselves reservation purchaser access on a subscription.

Only the following types of subscriptions support reservation purchases:

- Enterprise Agreement (Azure offers MS-AZR-0017P or MS-AZR-0148P)
- Pay-As-You-Go subscription (Azure offers MS-AZR-0003P or MS-AZR-0023P)
- Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription

Cloud solution providers can use the Azure portal or [Partner Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/azure-reservations) to purchase Azure reservations, or they can enable their customers to buy reservations from the Azure portal. 

Enterprise Agreement (EA) admins can limit purchases by disabling the **Add Reserved Instances** option in the EA portal. Disabling the option prevents everyone except EA admins from purchasing reservations.

## Scope reservations

You have three options to scope a reservation, depending on your needs:

- Shared scope - Applies the reservation discount to matching resources in eligible subscriptions that are in the billing context.
  - For Enterprise Agreement customers, the billing context is the enrollment.
  - For Microsoft Customer Agreement customers, the billing scope is the billing profile.
  - For individual subscriptions with pay-as-you-go rates, the billing scope includes all eligible subscriptions created by the account administrator.
- Single subscription scope - Applies the reservation discount to the matching resources in the selected subscription.
- Single resource group scope - Applies the reservation discount to the matching resources in the selected resource group only.

## Purchase a reservation

To buy an instance:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **All services** &gt; **Reservations**.

1. In the top menu bar, select **Add** to purchase a new reservation. The **Purchase reservations** pane appears.

1. Select the product that you want to purchase reservations for. The **Select the product you want to purchase** pane appears. Azure recommends products and quantities that maximize your savings.

1. Select **Add to cart**, and then select **Close**.

1. Select **Next: Review + buy**.

You can view and manage reservations in the Azure portal at Reservations. Reservation utilization can take up to a day to update after the purchase.

You can also make reservation purchases programmatically using any of the following methods:

- REST API: https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/reserved-vm-instances/reservationorder
- Azure PowerShell: https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.reservations
- Azure CLI: https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reservations/reservation-order

After you've made a reservation purchase, you can manage it in several ways outlined in the next unit.
