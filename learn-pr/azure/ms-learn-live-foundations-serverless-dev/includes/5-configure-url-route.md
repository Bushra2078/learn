## üíª Exercise - Change the URL route of a function

To change the route of a function we can add the ‚Äúroute‚Äù attribute to the configuration. This supports placeholders which allows us to make a portion of the URL dynamic.

In the context of Azure functions, these placeholders are called ‚Äúbinding expressions‚Äù and can be identified by the curly braces.

## Objective

Change the route of a function to support a dynamic binding expression.

## Instructions

1. In Visual Studio Code, locate the folder `GetProduct` in the functions project and expand it
1. Open the file named `function.json`
1. Change it to include a route definition of `product/{productId}`

The file's content should look like this:


```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get, post"
      ],
      "route": "product/{productId}"
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ],
  "scriptFile": "../dist/GetProduct/index.js"
}
```

Build and run the project and navigate to the URL shown in the output panel.

Before the change our function was hosted at `/api/GetProduct`.
Now, the new URL will be similar to `localhost:7071/api/product/{productId}`.

Make sure to replace `{productId}` with an arbitrary character sequence.
