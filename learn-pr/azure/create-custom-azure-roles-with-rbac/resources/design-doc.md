## Role(s)

Administrator

## Level

Beginner

## Product(s)

Role-based access control for Azure resources

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of access management concepts in Azure like role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure resources

## Summary

Understand the structure of role definitions for access control. Identify the role properties to use that define your custom role permissions. Create a custom role and assign to a user.

## Learning objectives

1. Identify role definition structure and properties
1. Create and manage a custom user role for Azure resource access management

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Create custom roles for Azure resources with role-based access control (RBAC)*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Identify permissions needed for scenario|grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job|Exercise (in Create unit)|Identify role definition structure and properties|yes |
| Create custom role in Azure | grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job | Exercise | Create and manage a custom user role  | YES |
|Assign custom role | grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job | Exercise | Create and manage a custom user role | No with create exercise |
|Test custom role | grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job | Exercise | Create and manage a custom user role | No with create exercise |
| View custom roles | grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job| Exercise | Create and manage a custom user role | No with other manage tasks |
| Manage (update and delete) custom roles | grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job| Exercise | Create and manage a custom user role | YES with view task |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    You work for an organization where your team manages a website hosted on Azure VMs. You're assigned the Owner role for the subscription that contains the website's resources. To keep your Azure resources secure, you segregate duties within your team and only grant users the minimum access permissions they need to do their job. You have a new employee that's responsible for managing VMs within the subscription. They need to be able to monitor the VMs and do troubleshooting tasks like restarting the VMs.

1. **What are custom roles in Azure?**

    Sometimes, the roles that are built into Azure don't grant the precise level of access that you need. In such cases, you can create a custom role by using PowerShell or Azure CLI commands.

    - Describe AD and RBAC differences with regard to custom roles
    - Assigning custom roles?
        - Cover who can be assigned e.g. users, groups, service principals and managed identities
        - Who can assign and who can create custom roles (Owner RBAC role for scope or User Access Administrator RBAC role)
    - Role Definition and structure
        - Describe as a collection of permissions 
        - Detail the format of the permissions e.g. {Company}.{ProviderName}/{resourceType}/{action}
    - Determining permissions
        - Examine scenario with regard VM permissions, probably determine the current default permissions are not restrictive enough, so will need custom role
        - Determine required permissions. Resource provider operations (Actions/NotActions), Data operations (DataActions/NotDataActions), Scope (AssignableScopes) 
        
        > [!NOTE]
        > Currently, you cannot set AssignableScopes to a management group scope. This may be available by the time the module is complete. So we'll need to revisit this and update content when management scope is available.


1. **Exercise - Create a custom role**

   1. Discover permissions needed in the scenario
   1. Create JSON file with role definition
   1. Run CLI command to create custom role
   1. List custom role in CLI
   1. Assign role to user
   1. Test role

1. **Manage custom roles**

    - List roles
        - How you can list, update, and delete custom roles (portal, PowerShell, CLI, REST options)
        - Discuss how AssignableScopes can be used to determine who can edit the role
    - Relate back to the scenario to demonstrate how you would use this to keep track of custom roles and assignments

1. **Exercise - View and manage a custom role**

   1. View custom role in Azure portal
   1. Update custom role in CLI
   1. Delete custom role in CLI
   1. Demonstrate the edited list after each change

1. **Summary**

    In the scenario, you wanted to grant access to the new employee so that they could monitor and troubleshoot the VMs that host your website in Azure. However, to maximize security, you wanted to prevent that employee from taking any other actions. By creating a custom role in a JSON file, and then applying it using the Azure CLI, you've satisfied those requirements.

    The built-in RBAC roles in Azure are versatile and often satisfactory for many organizations. You might not need to create custom roles. However, if you have very specific requirements or want to keep a close control of permissions, custom RBAC roles can be used to enable people to do their jobs and prevent malicious actions.

## Notes

- Use this as the base of the solution for the scenario: [Create custom roles for Azure resources using Azure CLI](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-cli)

Topics to cover:

1. When to use custom roles
1. Difference between Azure AD custom roles and RBAC custom roles. RBAC custom roles are to manage Azure resources.
1. Who you can assign them to: custom roles can be assigned to users, groups, service principals, or managed identities.
1. Permissions needed: Owner RBAC role for scope or User Access Administrator RBAC role
1. For scenario, review VM related built in roles (to see need for custom role): [Built-in roles for Azure resources](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles). Admins should first try to find a suitable built-in role before trying to create a custom role. You could say that the Virtual Machine Contributor built-in role has more permissions than the employee needs and Virtual Machine Administrator Login does not have enough, so you decide to create a custom role.
1. Role definition structure and properties
1. Determine permissions needed based on scenario:
   - Resource provider operations (Actions/NotActions)
   - Data operations (DataActions/NotDataActions)
   - Scope (AssignableScopes) - Currently, you cannot set AssignableScopes to a management group scope. This may be available  by the time the module is complete. So we'll need to revisit this and update content when management scope is available.
1. Exercise to create custom user role by using Azure CLI (exercise)
   1. Discover permissions needed
   1. Create JSON file with role definition
   1. Run CLI command to create custom role
   1. List custom role in CLI
   1. Assign to role to user
   1. Test role 
1. Manage custom roles
   - [Who can manage](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#who-can-create-delete-update-or-view-a-custom-role)
   - How you can list, update, and delete custom roles (portal, PowerShell, CLI, REST options)
1. Exercise for manage custom roles 
   1. View custom role in Azure portal
   1. Update custom role in CLI
   1. Delete custom role in CLI

Rearrange that list above into units as you see fit (learn > exercise > learn > exercise).

- There is a published module on RBAC. There is another one coming 
about assigning management access with RBAC. That one plans to cover RBAC vs. AD roles. So check those to make sure we're not duplicating content. E.g. Don't explain basic RBAC concepts.
