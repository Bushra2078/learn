Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of performing preliminary analysis of a data set to find out any obvious anomalies and missing information. The primary purpose of EDA is to get a generic view of the data set without any pre-concieved assumptions. 

The main focus of performing EDA is to find out the following in a data set:

- Generic understanding of the data and its structure
- Missing or incomplete information
- Mistakes and anomalies
- Relationship between different variables
- How different assumptions will work against the available data set
