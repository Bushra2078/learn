Apache Spark notebooks of Azure Databicks provide many functions that allow you to perform basic and advanced exploratory data analysis. You can use these notebooks for basic analysis such as data cleaning and managing missing values, or you go on a more advanced level to perform critical data analysis such as feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and feature importance estimation.
