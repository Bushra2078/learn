In this module, you learned how to classify data. You also learned how to review how your data will be used, performance requirements for your application, and whether your data requires transactions. Considering the specific datasets for an online retailing scenario, you learned why some Azure services are better suited for the job than others. You can now apply these learnings to future projects when you're choosing which solution to use for data storage in Azure.
