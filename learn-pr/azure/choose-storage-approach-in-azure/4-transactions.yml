  questions:
  - content: "Which type of transactional database system would work best for product data?"
    choices:
    - content: "OLAP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "OLTP systems support a large set of users, have quick response times, handle large volumes of data, are highly available, and are great for small or relatively simple transactions."
    - content: "OLTP"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "OLTP systems support a large set of users, have quick response times, handle large volumes of data, are highly available, and are great for small or relatively simple transactions."

  - content: "Suppose a store's operations to update inventory and process payments are in the same transaction. A user is trying to apply a $30 store credit on an order from his laptop and is submitting the exact same order using the store credit (for the full amount) from his phone - so two identical orders are received. The database behind the scenes is an ACID-compliant database. What would happen?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Both orders would be processed and use the in-store credit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Once the second order determined that the in-store credit has already been used, it would roll back the transaction."
    - content: "One order would be processed and use the in-store credit, and the other order would update the remaining inventory for the items in the basket, but would not complete the order."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Once the second order determined that the in-store credit has already been used, it would roll back the transaction."
    - content: "One order would be processed and use the in-store credit, and the other order would not be processed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Once the second order determined that the in-store credit has already been used, it would roll back the transaction."
