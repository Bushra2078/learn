## Example scenario

Suppose you're responsible for deploying and configuring the Azure infrastructure at a toy company. You've created a Bicep template to deploy your company's website. Until now, you've been deploying it from your own computer by using command-line tools. You've decided to move the deployment into a pipeline. One of your colleagues has told you that you need to set up a service principal for the deployment pipeline, and you need to understand what this is, and then set it up so you can deploy your company's website.
