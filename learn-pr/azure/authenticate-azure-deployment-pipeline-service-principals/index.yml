summary: |
  Service principals enable your deployment pipelines to authenticate securely with Azure.

  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  - Explain what a service principal is, how it works, and how it compares to a managed identity
  - Create a service principal and manage its keys
  - Configure the appropriate authorization for a service principal to deploy Azure resources
prerequisites: |
