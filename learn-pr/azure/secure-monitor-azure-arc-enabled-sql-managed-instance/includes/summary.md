In this module, you explored the security and monitoring capabilities of Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance. These capabilities allowed you to protect the on-premises databases through integration with your Active Directory environment, support for Transparent Data Encryption, and the ability to constrain container level privileges in the manner that complies with the principle of least privilege. 

You also verified that open-source solutions such as Grafana and Kibana offer insights into Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance metrics and logs. Lastly, you confirmed that Azure Monitor provides the option to implement a single pane of glass interface for monitoring on-premises and cloud-resident SQL Server-based workloads.
