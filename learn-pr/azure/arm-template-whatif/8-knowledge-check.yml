  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What scenario describes most accurately the benefits of using the what-if operation when you're deploying a resource in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "To validate if an ARM template uses recommended practices at the time of deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The ARM template test toolkit checks your template for recommended practices. The what-if operation lets you see how resources will change if you deploy the template."
    - content: "To verify the effects and impact of the deployment of the template."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The what-if operation lets you see how resources will change if you deploy the template. The what-if operation doesn't make any changes to existing resources. Instead, it predicts the changes if the specified template is deployed."
    - content: "To deploy the template in a sandbox environment in order to validate if the results of the deployment match expected results."
      isCorrect: false

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The answer is correct."  
    - content: "Existing resources are left unchanged, even if they're not specified in the template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This behavior is called *incremental mode* and is the opposite of complete mode."
    - content: "You're asked to complete the deployment with a yes/no prompt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is the role of the *confirm switch*."  
    - content: "A resource is waiting for another resource to finish deploying before deployment can begin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Resource Manager figures this out by itself, most of the time."
