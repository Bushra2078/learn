  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What scenario describes most accurately the benefits of using the what-if operation when you're deploying a resource in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "To validate if an ARM template uses recommended practices at the time of deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The ARM template test toolkit checks your template for recommended practices. The what-if operation lets you see how resources will change if you deploy the template."
    - content: "To verify the effects and impact of the deployment of the template."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The what-if operation lets you see how resources will change if you deploy the template. The what-if operation doesn't make any changes to existing resources. Instead, it predicts the changes if the specified template is deployed."
    - content: "To deploy the template in a sandbox environment in order to validate if the results of the deployment match expected results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The what-if operation evaluates the effects the deployment of the template against the target environment without making *any* changes to the environment."
  - content: "What's the effect of using *complete mode* when deploying?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Existing resources are left unchanged, even if they're not specified in the template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This behavior is called *incremental mode* and is the opposite of complete mode."
    - content: "You're asked to complete the deployment with a yes/no prompt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is the role of the *confirm switch*."  
    - content: "A resource is waiting for another resource to finish deploying before deployment can begin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Resource Manager figures this out by itself, most of the time."
  - content: "How would you run a single test by using the test toolkit?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the flag `-TestName` and specify the test name with double quotation marks: \"Template Should Not Contain Blanks\"."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The flag is called `-Test`."
    - content: "Use the flag `-Test` and specify the test as number between 1 and *n*, where *n* is the number of tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can't use a number."    
    - content: "Use the flag `-Test` and specify the test name with double quotation marks: \"Template Should Not Contain Blanks\"."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The answer is correct."
    - content: "Use the `-Run-Only` flag and specify which test with double quotation marks."
