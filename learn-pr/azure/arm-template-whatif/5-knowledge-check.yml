  questions:
  - content: "What scenario describes most accurately the benefits of using the what-if operation when you're deploying a resource in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "To validate if an ARM template uses recommended practices at the time of deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The ARM template test toolkit checks your template for recommended practices. The what-if operation lets you see how resources will change if you deploy the template."
    - content: "To verify the effects and impact of the deployment of the template."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The what-if operation lets you see how resources will change if you deploy the template. The what-if operation doesn't make any changes to existing resources. Instead, it predicts the changes if the specified template is deployed."
    - content: "To deploy the template in a sandbox environment in order to validate if the results of the deployment match expected results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The what-if operation evaluates the effects the deployment of the template against the target environment without making *any* changes to the environment."
  - content: "What's the effect of using *complete mode* when deploying?"
    choices:
    - content: "Resources that are not specified in the template are removed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In complete mode, Resource Manager will delete any resources not declared in the template."  
    - content: "Existing resources are left unchanged, even if they're not specified in the template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This behavior is called *incremental mode* and is the opposite of complete mode."
    - content: "You're asked to complete the deployment with a yes/no prompt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is the role of the *confirm switch*."  
    - content: "A resource is waiting for another resource to finish deploying before deployment can begin."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Resource Manager figures this out by itself, most of the time."
  - content: |
      You have a resource group containing a storage account named `storageaccount1`.
      You have a template file that declares a storage account named `storageaccount2`.
      You execute a what-if operation and the incremental deployment mode.
      Which of these change types will be detected by the what-if operation?
    choices:
    - content: Delete
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Delete change type is returned when the deployment is in complete mode."
    - content: Ignore
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The what-if command will detect that `storageaccount1` is already deployed to the resource group but isn't in the template. Since you specified the incremental deployment mode, it returns the Ignore change type for `storageaccount1`."
    - content: NoChange
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The NoChange change type is returned when a resource is already deployed to the resource group and also defined in the template."
