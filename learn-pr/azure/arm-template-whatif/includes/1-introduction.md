Deployments using Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templatas) and Bicep files result in a series of changes to your Azure environment. In this module, you learn how to review the changes that will happen before you execute a deployment.

## Example scenario

You're on a software team that's authoring these templates for the company Tailwind Traders. You plan to deploy the described infrastructure in the templates. As you author these templates, it's important that you're aware of any issues before deployment. You've had problems in the past with deploying something other than what you think you're deploying, so you decide to evaluate how to preview changes in your deployments.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you gain an understanding of the what-if operation for Azure Resource Manager. You also learn about the modes you can use for your deployments to Azure.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to preview the changes that will happen before you deploy by using the what-if operation.
