**TODO this intro needs to be updated!**

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates use things like parameters, variables, and functions to create the templates. These constructs save you time, because you don't need to create a new template for each environment. You also get consistent naming.

## Example scenario

You're on a software team that's authoring these templates for the company Tailwind Traders. You plan to deploy the described infrastructure in the templates. As you author these templates, you care about having a fast feedback loop. It's important that you're aware of any issues before deployment. Issues that can happen while authoring include errors in the templates, violation of good practices, or deploying something other than what you think you're deploying.

You decide to evaluate the existing set of tools that addresses these issues.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you gain an understanding of what practices are beneficial to follow and why it's important. You also practice using the what-if command and the ARM template test toolkit to correct issues in your templates.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to preview the changes that will happen before you deploy by using the what-if operation.
