The design team at your toy company asked you to update a template with a virtual network. You needed to check the effects of the change before deploying it.

In this module, you learned about the benefits of the what-if operation, so that you can understand exactly what changes will be made when you deploy your templates.

By using the what-if operation, you can minimize concerns like whether a new deployment will break the existing setup. It's also a good mental check to see if what you intend to happen is actually what will happen.
