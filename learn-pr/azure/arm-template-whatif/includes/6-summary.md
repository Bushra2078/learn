In this module, you learned about the benefits of knowing beforehand what will be deployed. This pre-knowledge helps with concerns like whether a new deployment will break the existing setup. It's also a good mental check to see if what you intend to happen is actually what will happen. You learned that the *what-if* operation is the tool that will help you address these concerns.
