Our goal in this module was to help you evaluate whether the Azure Developer CLI can improve the cloud journey for your app. We discussed the following features and benefits provided by `azd`:

- Easy to use commands that map to common developer workflow steps
- A library of reusable, extensible templates that are preconfigured for common scenarios
- The ability to convert your own projects into new `azd` templates
- Compatibility and support for CI/CD pipelines and monitoring

Today's connected world is increasingly being driven by the *API economy*&mdash;how API usage by developers and their consumers generates important revenue streams for the companies that publish the APIs. If you want to maximize your API economy, you need to use this module's criteria to assess how well Azure API Management would improve your organization's ability to adapt its APIs to satisfy consumers, follow business trends, and take advantage of new opportunities. The process you went through here should give you enough information to choose the correct API lifecycle management solution for your organization.
