Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multi-cloud, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data. 

## Module scenario

Suppose you work as a data analyst for a financial institution that analyzes, processes, and governs a large amount of data stored in Microsoft Azure database solutions. Your company’s data assets are stored in Microsoft Azure SQL Databases and in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database managed instance. Currently, you spend time on manual processes to annotate, catalog, and find trusted sources. Not having an end-to-end data lineage across the data estate also impacts the data consumers. They spend a lot of time tracing root cause problems created by upstream data pipelines that are owned by other teams.

Your IT Manager must get a complete and comprehensive overview of all your data flows, sources, transformations, and dependencies, so they can take control of your company’s data assets. They want to ensure accurate reporting, have a clear overview of how crucial calculations were derived, and improve data governance frameworks. Being able to have this level of understanding about your company’s data will reinforce your company’s overall data management strategy, increase their trust in the data, and make the data a truly enterprise-wide asset.

You’ve been requested to configure Microsoft Microsoft Purview as a central location for your company’s data. With Microsoft Purview, your organization can understand what data the business has, where it’s stored, and its data-mining value.

Microsoft Purview is designed to address these issues and to help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets. The Microsoft Purview Data Catalog makes data sources easily discoverable and understandable by the users who manage the data.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you’ll get a high-level overview of the process to register data sources stored in an Azure SQL database and in an Azure SQL Database managed instance. You’ll learn how you can use Microsoft Purview to help with these processes by:

- Identifying prerequisites.

- Setting up the correct network connections and security requirements.

- Configuring required credentials.

- Registering data sources.

- Creating scan rule sets.

- Creating a scan.

- Retrieving insights reports.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to describe the process of connecting different data sources running in Azure. You’ll also be able to use Microsoft Purview to help you manage your enterprise data environment and your various data sources.
