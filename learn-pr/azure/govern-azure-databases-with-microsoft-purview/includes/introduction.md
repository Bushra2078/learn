Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multicloud, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data. 

## Module scenario

Suppose you work as a data analyst for a financial institution that analyzes, processes, and governs a large amount of data stored in Microsoft Azure database solutions. Currently, you spend time on manual processes to annotate, catalog, and find trusted sources. And your data consumers spend a lot of time tracing root cause problems created by upstream data pipelines that are owned by other teams.

Your IT Manager needs a complete and comprehensive overview of all your data flows, sources, transformations, and dependencies, so they can take control of your company’s data assets. They want to ensure accurate reporting, have a clear overview of how crucial calculations were derived, and improve data governance frameworks.

You’ve been requested to configure Microsoft Purview as a central location for your company’s data. With Microsoft Purview, your organization can understand what data the business has, where it’s stored, and its data-mining value.

Microsoft Purview is designed to address these issues and to help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets. The Microsoft Purview Data Catalog makes data sources easily discoverable and understandable by the users who manage the data.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you’ll get a high-level overview of the process to register data sources stored in an Azure SQL database and in an Azure SQL Managed Instance and govern them in Microsoft Purview.
