title: Use advanced ARM features to manage complex deployment scenarios
summary: This module teaches you how to use advanced ARM features to manage complex scenarios like secrets management and conditional deployment among many things.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  - Control the deployment order of resources by using the _dependsOn_ construct.
  - Securely assign secrets like passwords to resources in your templates by using an Azure Key Vault and ARM template configuration.
  - Conditionally deploy resources by using the _condition_ construct and parameters at deployment time.
  - Deploy multiple resources of the same type by using the _copy_ construct and thereby reducing repetitive configuration.
