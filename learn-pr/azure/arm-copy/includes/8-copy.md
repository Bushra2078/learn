You've so far declared resources in a resources list in a template. When deploying, you end up getting one instance of each item specified in the resources list. There are however scenarios where you want to create more than one instance of a specific resource. It could, for example,  be that you want multiple subnets in a virtual network. 

There are different aspects to creating many instances, and iterating over constructs, that you might want to consider:

- **Do I need more than one copy**, for simpler scenarios this answer might be a no. For more advanced scenarios, like Subnets or Virtual Machines, you might need to consider whether you need more than one copy of something.
- **Am I dependent on a resource**. Normally Azure Resource Manager, ARM is good at figuring out what needs to be constructed in what order so that references within the ARM template work out. There are situations though where you might need to specify the order.
- **Define a naming scheme**. You want to give your resources meaningful names. For that reason, you rely parameters being passed at deploy time. When you have multiple copies, you might want to have more granular control and base the naming on what iteration in the copying sequence you are currently on
- **Configure and control resource creation**. You might want to limit how many resources are being created in a production environment. It's possible to do so by configuring the resource creation as *serial* or *parallel*.
- **Copy other types**. Resources aren't the only thing you can create multiple copies of and iterate over. You can in fact do the same with properties, variables, and output.
- **Parent-Child**. What about parent-child relationships in your resources, is that something that works or does it need to be configured?

## Creating multiple instances

One of the general benefits of using looping constructs is saving you keystrokes. If what you need is repeated over and over, fairly similar in name and type, and so on, and there are only slight differences, then it's a good use case for something called the *copy element*.

The *copy element* is piece of JSON that can be used on many types of constructs like resources, properties, variables, and output. The syntax for the *copy element* consists of the key _copy_ and with an array as value, like so **"copy": []**.  The array takes a number of elements and each element is an object `{}` consisting of set of properties. What these properties are depends on what type of construct they are used on. Typically all of the _copy_ element constructs have one property in common `count`. This property decides on how many instances you want of a certain type of construct. Most constructs also allow for a `name` property that gives you a reference that you can refer to in other parts of your code. Other properties used are usually construct-specific.

### What to choose

If I can use the _copy_ element on many types of constructs, which one should I choose and when, and can I use more than one type in a template?

It all depends on your use case. A _resource iteration_ allows you to create many copies of a resource and makes sense to use if you need many storage accounts for example. A _properties iteration_ on the other hand allows you to create many properties inside of one resource. It's about saving you keystrokes and time and you know best where you have repeated parts in your template. The answer is also *yes* to be able to use the *copy element* in many places in your template. You could be using a *copy element* to create many resources but also to create many  similar variables within the same template.

### How does it work

Ok, say I elect to use the _copy element_ how does it work, what's the end result? It works by  your _copy_ statement being evaluated and replaced. The replacement is the result of what you define within the _copy_ statement repeated as many time as you instructed in the `copy` field. 

Below JSON is an example of what a definition using _copy_ can look like:

```json
"copy": [
  {
    "name": "dataDisks",
    "count": 2,
    "input": {
      "diskSizeGB": 1023,
      "lun": "[copyIndex('dataDisks')]",
      "createOption": "Empty"
    }
  }
]
```

The above _copy_ element expression has an entry where **count: 2**, the value `2` means that you want the above expression to _expand_ to two entries. When this instruction is run, it will therefore turn into the below JSON:

```json
"dataDisks": [
{
  "lun": 0,
  "createOption": "Empty",
  "diskSizeGB": 1023
},
{
  "lun": 1,
  "createOption": "Empty",
  "diskSizeGB": 1023
}
```

From the above expression, you can see that the value of the `name` property has become the property name and the content of the `input` property have become the part of the JSON that's repeated.

> [!NOTE]
> The copy expression and it's output differs by what type of expression is used. The above JSON does give a good idea of what's going on when an expression is transformed into a series of repeated statements.

There are limits to how much can be copied. Currently the limit is at 800 entries.

## Controlling the iteration

There are helper functions that help you refer to specific indexes in the array. The function `copyIndex()` returns the current index. Say you are the third repeated entry, `copyIndex()` would then return the value `2`. The syntax of `copyIndex()` looks like the following code:

```json
copyIndex(loopName, offset)
```

The `copyIndex()` function has two different input parameters `loopName` and `offset`. The `offset` is always optional and is used to _offset_ you from the current index. What ever you add as `offset` value is added to the current index. If the current index returns `2` and you specify `1` as offset the `copyIndex()` function would return `3`.

The `loopName` parameter is either optional or mandatory depending on where it's used. 

- **loopName is mandatory**. It's mandatory if used inside of a _properties_ construct and optional if used in a _resources_ array. Below is an example where it's mandatory:

    ```json
    "properties": {
        "storageProfile": {
          "copy": [
            {
              "name": "dataDisks",
              "count": "[parameters('numberOfDataDisks')]",
              "input": {
                "diskSizeGB": 1023,
                "lun": "[copyIndex('dataDisks')]",
                "createOption": "Empty"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
    }
    ```

   The above JSON shows how the *copy element* is used inside of a `properties` construct and `copyIndex()` has the `loopName` specified like so **copyIndex('dataDisks')**.

- **loopName is optional**. Let's look at the other case where `loopName` is not mandatory:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks",
    "apiVersion": "2018-04-01",
    "name": "[concat(parameters('vnetname'), copyIndex())]",
  }
  ```

   Above a resource is being declared and `copyIndex()` is called with no parameters as it's being used in the context of a resource.
  
## Configure the deployment

When you use the copy element for resources, you end up creating numerous similar looking resources.

Sometimes you might want to control how resources are created and in what order. The reasons for controlling the order might be the below:

- **Environment limitations**. Depending on what environment you deploy to you might want to limit how much this environment is affected by a deployment. In a production environment, it makes sense to limit how many resources are affected at any one time. You can configure something called *deployment mode* to control the number of concurrently deployed resources. More on deployment modes in a subsection.
- **Dependencies**. You could be dependent on something to already exist before you venture on to create the resource you need. To express such a dependency, there's a construct called `dependsOn`.

### Deployment modes and _copy_

You might want to ensure that a set of resources created by the copy construct is all being created before something else. If that's the case, you need to express this situation. Let's quickly remind ourselves that what comes into play here is the deployment modes that ARM uses. There are two modes supported:

- **Serial**. Setting a resource to this deployment mode means it will be created one after another. In this mode, you are also expected to set a property `batchSize` to determine how many resources are deployed using this mode. A new *batch* can't be started before a preview one has completed. This ability to limit things this way is something you might want to use in a production environment, for example,  where it might be important to limit the number of affected resources at any one point.
- **parallel**. This mode is the default deployment mode. The advantages are high throughput so the template ends up being processed faster. The drawbacks are that you can't guarantee order and it might not, as mentioned in the above bullet, be what you want for production environment.

### Dependencies

In the context of the copy element, you need to tell the resource, with the dependency, what *copy element* section it's waiting for. You accomplish this dependency by referring to it by name with the below JSON:

```json
"resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "apiVersion": "2019-04-01",
      "name": "[concat(copyIndex(),'storage', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "sku": {
        "name": "Standard_LRS"
      },
      "kind": "Storage",
      "copy": {
        "name": "storagecopy",
        "count": 3
      },
      "properties": {}
    },
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines",
      "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
      "name": "[concat('VM', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]",
      "dependsOn": ["storagecopy"],
    }
  ]
```

In the above JSON the *copy element* has a `name` property with the value `storagecopy` and the dependent resource, a storage account is *waiting* for the *copy element* operation to finish with this expression **"dependsOn": ["storagecopy"]**. Thereby ARM switches to a serial deployment mode between these two resources. It might affect the throughput speed of the deployment but you've expressed that you care about a certain deployment order, which will now take precedence.
