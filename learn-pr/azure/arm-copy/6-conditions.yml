  title: Manage conditions and deployment order
  description: You will want to sometime express whether something should be
    deployed or not. Moreover you might also want to express that for something
    to be deployed, something else needs to exist first. ARM itself, the
    condition and dependsOn constructs are able to handle these cases.
