In this module, you learned about Hyperscale, a deployment option for Azure Database for PostgreSQL. You learned how to create a Hyperscale instance, create and load data into a distributed table, and scale up your server group.

## Clean up

It's important that you clean up any unused resources. You're charged for the configured capacity not how much of the database is used. For this module, we make these resources available to you free of charge. But you should get into the habit of deleting resources when you're done with them.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. In the navigation menu on the left, click **Resource Groups**, and then click the resource group that you created as part of the optional exercise in unit 3.
1. In the **Overview** pane, click **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter the name of the resource group that you created to confirm, and then click **Delete**.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Create a Hyperscale instance of Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
* Shard and distribute tables in Hyperscale.
* Scale and rebalance a Hyperscale database.
