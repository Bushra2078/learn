You can build many types of applications, like:

- business applications to capture, analyze, and process data
- dynamic web applications that can be accessed from a web browser
- games, both 2D and 3D
- financial and scientific applications
- cloud-based applications
- mobile applications

But how do you get started?

By far, the best way to learn how to code is to write code as much code as possible. So, we encourage you to type along with the exercises in this module and the others in this learning path. Typing the code yourself in each exercise and solving small coding challenges will accelerate your learning.

Furthermore, you need to begin learning small foundational concepts and build on them with continual practice and exploration.

In this module, you will build a Python development environment that will allow you to learn and build many types of applications.  You'll learn what Python is, popular uses, and the overall process of writing and executing your code.  You'll learn the roles of the various tools in your development environment and how they help you achieve your desired result.

By the end of this module, you'll have learned the necessary background information and have installed the tools on your computer to move forward towards your goal of building real applications with Python.

## Learning objectives
