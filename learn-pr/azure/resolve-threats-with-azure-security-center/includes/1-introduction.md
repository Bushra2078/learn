**Azure Security Center** is a primary tool in that response plan, and learning how to use all its features can help you quickly identify real threats from false positives. Security Center enables you to find & fix vulnerabilities, aids in blocking malicious access, and alerts you when your resources are under attack.

> [!TIP]
> Azure Security Center pulls data from all your created resources. The level of detail presented will vary based on the running workloads in your subscription(s). This is particularly true in the Azure Sandbox which doesn't have any data.
