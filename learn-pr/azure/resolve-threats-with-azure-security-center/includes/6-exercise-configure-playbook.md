Workflow Automations are created directly in the Defender for Cloud portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need a Microsoft 365 email account to use this specific set of instructions - if you don't have one, try changing the instructions below to use a different template, or create a blank Logic App.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) with the same account you used to activate the Azure Sandbox.

1. Search for **Defender for Cloud** using the search box. The **Overview** pane for the Defender for Cloud appears.

1. In the left menu pane, under **Management**, select **Workflow automation**.

1. In the top menu bar, select the **Add workflow automation** to create a new automation. The **Add workflow automation** pane appears.

1. Enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    | **General** |
    |Name     | _RespondToMalwareAlert_      |
    |Subscription     |_Concierge Subscription_     |
    |Resource group     | <rgn>[Learn resource group]</rgn> |
    | **Trigger conditions** |
   |Select Defender for Cloud data types     |  _Threat detection alerts_   |
   |Alert name contains    | _Malware_      |
   |Alert severity    |  _All severities selected_      |

1. Under **Actions** you can select an existing Azure Logic App, or create a new one. Since we don't have any yet, select the **visit the Logic Apps page** link to build a new Logic App.

    The **Logic apps** pane appears. Make sure you're still in the Microsoft Learn Sandbox directory before continuing.

1. In the top menu bar, select **Add** > **Consumption**. The **Create a logic app** pane appears.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting  | Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    | **Project details** |
    |Subscription     | _Concierge Subscription_     |
    |Resource group     | <rgn>[Learn resource group]</rgn> |
    | **Instance details** |
    | Logic app name     | _RespondToMalwareAlert_      |

    Accept the default values for the rest of the fields.

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create**. It takes a minute or two to create the app. You can monitor the creation through the alerts icon, or select **Refresh** to refresh the screen.

1. Once the Logic App has been created, select **Go to resource**.

1. Scroll down to the **Templates** section and select **Security** from the Category dropdown list.

1. Select **Get a notification email when Defender for Cloud detects a threat** as shown below. You could also select **Blank Logic App** if you wanted to create some custom logic to run in response to an alert, or if you don't have an M365-based email account.

1. Select **Use this template** to create the app.

1. Provide credentials for Office 365 Outlook to connect your email account. Once validated, the owning email will be shown on the Office 365 Outlook connector.

1. Select **+** on the **Defender for Cloud Alert** connector to add support for Defender for Cloud.

1. Select **Continue** to move to the details page.

1. Specify a target email address to send the notification to.

1. On this screen, you can change the subject of the email as well as all the details that will be included.

1. You can use the **+ New step** to create additional logic steps in the flow. In this case, we don't need anymore so select **Save** from the top menu bar.

1. Switch back to the Defender for Cloud pane, or tab and select **Refresh** to select your newly created Logic App.

1. Select **RespondToMalwareAlert** from the list of Logic Apps.

1. Select **Create** to create the workflow automation.

## Run a Workflow automation from Microsoft Defender for Cloud

You normally run playbooks from the workload protection dashboard using an existing alert.

1. Go back to the workload protection dashboard. You can use the breadcrumb bar at the top to back up.

1. Under **Threat Detection**, select **Security incidents & alerts**.

1. Here, you would select an alert, and at the top of the details page, select **Run playbooks**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Run playbooks option.](../media/7-security-center-playbooks.png)

In this case, in the Azure Sandbox, you likely don't have any alerts - so you can't execute the playbook this way. However, we can test it through the Logic Apps panel.

## Test a workflow automation from Logic Apps

1. Select **Home** from the left-corner sidebar. You should see your Logic App as a recently created resource. If not, try searching for it from the top search bar - recall the name is **RespondToMalwareAlert**.

1. On the **Overview** pane, from the top menu bar, select **Run Trigger**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Run Trigger option in Azure Logic Apps.](../media/6-run-playbook-from-logic-apps.png)

1. A new entry will show up under the _Runs history_ tab in the Overview pane. You can select that entry to drill into details. For example, you can drill into the inputs and outputs of the run:
