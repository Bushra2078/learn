In this module, you:

- Learned about Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and why it's used.
- Explored different ways to enable CORS for your Azure Storage Services.
- Learned how to set CORS rules to accept and deny requests sent to your storage service resources from a web request originating outside your domain.

This is powerful tool you can use to access resources you own across domains.
