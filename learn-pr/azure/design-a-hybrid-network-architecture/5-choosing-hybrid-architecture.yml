  questions:
  - content: 'What is a valid use case for using Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: Mission-critical workloads
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ExpressRoute is the recommended service for mission-critical large-scale workloads.
    - content: For prototyping
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute is not the best connectivity method for prototyping in Azure as it is expensive and takes time to set up.
    - content: Dev/Test workloads
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute is not the most suitable connection method for dev/test workloads as it is expensive and takes time to set up.
    - content: Small production workloads
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN Gateway is better suited for small production workloads and lower traffic throughput.
  - content: 'Why would an organization choose VPN Gateway over Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: Bandwidth limitations 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute has a wide selection of available bandwidths.
