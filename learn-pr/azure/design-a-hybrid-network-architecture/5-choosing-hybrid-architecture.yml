  questions:
  - content: 'What is a valid use case for using Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: Mission-critical workloads
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ExpressRoute is the recommended service for mission-critical large-scale workloads.
    - content: For prototyping
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute is not the best connectivity method for prototyping in Azure as it is expensive and takes time to set up.
    - content: Dev/Test workloads
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute is not the most suitable connection method for dev/test workloads as it is expensive and takes time to set up.
    - content: Small production workloads
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN Gateway is better suited for small production workloads and lower traffic throughput.
  - content: 'Why would an organization choose VPN Gateway over Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: Bandwidth limitations 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute has a wide selection of available bandwidths.
    - content: Cost and Traffic Volume
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: VPN Gateway is cheaper than ExpressRoute and is more suited for smaller traffic volumes.
    - content: Redundancy support
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Both services have redundancy support through adding them to an Azure availability zone.
    - content: Lack of ExpressRoute partners
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There is a rich ecosystem of system integrators and partners for ExpressRoute.
  - content: 'What is the preferred connectivity method for Remote Desktop Connections (RDC)?'
    choices:
    - content: Site-to-Site VPN
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Site-to-site VPN connections are to connect on-premises datacenters with Azure.
    - content: Azure ExpressRoute
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure ExpressRoute is for high volume mission-critical workloads.
    - content: Point-to-site VPN
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A point-to-site VPN connection should be used for RDC scenarios from a local client machine to Azure.
    - content: Direct connection to Azure VM
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: It's possible to directly connect to an Azure VM, but it's not the recommended method.
