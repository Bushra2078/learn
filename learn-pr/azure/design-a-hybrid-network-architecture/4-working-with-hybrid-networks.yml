  questions:
  - content: 'Why are VPN Gateways simpler to implement than ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: ExpressRoute does not support Resource Manager templates
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute does support Resource Manager templates.
    - content: Template connectivity models
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Connectivity models are templates to a degree but still require configuration, these also exist in ExpressRoute.
    - content: Connectivity to the Microsoft Cloud Platform
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN gateways do not provide connectivity to the all Microsoft Cloud platform services.
    - content: Familiarity with network architects
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: VPN Gateway is a similar technology for connecting networks and has been used on-premises for decades.
  - content: 'How are VPN Gateway connections to on-premises routed?'
    choices:
    - content: Through a private VPN connection
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN Gateways do not use a private connection.
    - content: Over the public internet
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: VPN Gateway sends encrypted traffic between on-premises and the Azure network over the public internet.
    - content: Through the Azure data-center
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN gateways are used to connect to an Azure network in your subscription not to an Azure data-center. 
    - content: By provisioning a traffic manager
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Traffic managers help with routing and traffic filtering but not for on-premises.
  - content: 'Which is a benefit of a hub-spoke architecture?'
    choices:
    - content: Greater cost visibility
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture can help towards cost reduction not visibility.
    - content: Greater security
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture may be more secure but it is not normally thought of as a benefit.
    - content: Greater business visibility
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The hub becomes the core of the business and provides the foundations for much deeper business insight.
    - content: Faster network communications
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture could help towards increased network speed but it is not guaranteed to remove network bottlenecks.
