  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Why would you implement a VPN Gateway in your Azure virtual network?'
    choices:
    - content: To improve the performance of the ExpressRoute circuit.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A VPN Gateway would be used to provide extra resiliency should the ExpressRoute circuit be unavailable.
    - content: To allow the ExpressRoute circuit to connect to your Azure virtual network.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The ExpressRoute circuit connects to a Microsoft edge router not to a VPN Gateway.
    - content: To allow the ExpressRoute circuit to connect to your on-premises network.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The ExpressRoute circuit connect to a connectivity providers local edge routers.
    - content: To provide a redundant failover connection.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The VPN Gateway provides a direct connection between your on-premises gateway and the Azure virtual network. This can be used in the event of an ExpressRoute circuit failure.
  - content: 'How are VPN Gateway connections to on-premises routed?'
    choices:
    - content: Through a private VPN connection
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN Gateways do not use a private connection.
    - content: Over the public internet
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: VPN Gateway sends encrypted traffic between on-premises and the Azure network over the public internet.
    - content: Through the Azure Datacenter
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN gateways are used to connect to an Azure network in your subscription not to an Azure data-center. 
    - content: By provisioning a traffic manager
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Traffic managers help with routing and traffic filtering but not for on-premises.
  - content: 'What is the underlying reason for implementing a hub-spoke architecture?'
    choices:
    - content: Greater cost visibility
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture can help towards cost reduction not visibility.
    - content: Greater security
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture may be more secure but it is not normally thought of as a benefit.
    - content: Greater business visibility
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The hub becomes the core of the business and provides the foundations for much deeper business insight.
    - content: Faster network communications
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture could help towards increased network speed but it is not guaranteed to remove network bottlenecks.
