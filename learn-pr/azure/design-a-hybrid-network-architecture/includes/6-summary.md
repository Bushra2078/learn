You work for a global enterprise, planning a migration to Azure. The migration needs to integrate resources in Azure with your on-premises networks. Additionally, your company has a central datacenter that requires connectivity to Azure, along with several remote offices.

In this module, you examined some of the technologies available to connect your on-premises network with the Azure Cloud. You now understand how an Azure Virtual Network operates. The benefits of an Azure VPN Gateway and the associated topologies like Site-to-Site, Point-to-Site. Additionally, you know the benefits and features of several hybrid network architectures, including ExpressRoute, VPN, ExpressRoute with VPN, and the Hub-spoke topology.

You can apply this knowledge to the migration. Using a Microsoft connectivity provider to provision an ExpressRoute connection provides your organization a fast and secure connection to the cloud. The ExpressRoute circuit can incorporate a VPN failover for additional resilience. So, should the ExpressRoute circuit become temporarily unavailable, the VPN link maintains the connection.

By using a hybrid network architecture like ExpressRoute, you enable your users a single-sign-on user experience providing a feature-rich, cost-effective, and private networking connection.
