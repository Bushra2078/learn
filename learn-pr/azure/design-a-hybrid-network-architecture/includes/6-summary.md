In this module, you explored the possibilities for extending and integrating your on-premises networks to Azure. You covered using VPN Gateway and Azure ExpressRoute for on-premises connections, the use cases for each and a high-level overview of a supported architectural pattern.

You've learned how to:

- Identify the methods to integrate on-premises networks with Azure
- Identify the features and limitations of each method of network integration
