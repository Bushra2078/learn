In this module, you examined some of the technologies available to connect your on-premises network with the Azure Cloud. You now understand how an Azure virtual network operates. You learned about the capabilities of an Azure VPN Gateway and the associated topologies like site-to-site and point-to-site. Additionally, you know the benefits and features of several hybrid network services and architectures, including ExpressRoute, VPN, ExpressRoute with VPN, and the Hub-spoke topology.

You can apply this knowledge to the migration. Using a Microsoft connectivity provider to provision an ExpressRoute connection provides your organization a fast and secure connection to the cloud. The ExpressRoute circuit can incorporate a VPN failover for additional resilience. Should the ExpressRoute circuit become temporarily unavailable, the VPN link maintains the connection.

By using a hybrid network architecture like ExpressRoute, you enable your users a high performance user experience providing a feature-rich, cost-effective, and private networking connection.
