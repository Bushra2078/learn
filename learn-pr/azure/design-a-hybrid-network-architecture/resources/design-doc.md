## Notes

Azure VPN Gateway – Used to connect to on-premises networks over the internet through VPN. Uses, pros, and cons of this option will be covered. For the example scenario, VPN will be used to connect to smaller locations that don’t have enough traffic demands to necessitate ExpressRoute.

Azure ExpressRoute – Used to provide a private, dedicated connection to Azure. Uses, pros, and cons of this option will be covered. For the example scenario, ExpressRoute will be used to connect the headquarters location and data centers to Azure due to the higher traffic requirements.

Azure ExpressRoute with VPN failover – Used to provide a cost-effective failover option for ExpressRoute. Uses, pros, and cons of this option will be covered. For the example scenario, VPN failover will be used for the data center locations to ensure there is continuous connectivity to Azure in the event of a circuit provider failure.

Azure Virtual Network – Used to provide a location for gateways and for resources that need connectivity.

## Feedback

- Unit 5 isn't going to work. We don't have the ability to do ExpressRoute in sandbox. I expect this entire module to be conceptual with the only hands on interactivity coming from quizzes. **DW - Removed the exercise now**

- Move the knowledge check questions into the end of the units to slim down the overall number of units this module contains. 12 is too many. This will drop it to 8, and if unit 5 is removed that will put the total at 7. **Moved knowledge checks to one big quiz at the end, assuming i've understood your comments correctly**

- Can you expand on the details that are intended to be covered in 8. Creating Azure virtual networks? We have other modules that detail the ins and outs of virtual networks, so unless we're covering more advanced topics here, let's make sure this is needed and is of value. **It was simply a high level overview to cover a little about virtual networks nothing more the title was poorly named! I did raise the question about duplication in this module before i started the design, happy to remove if needs be**

I'm ok with this, but make sure these are real-world scenarios so the learner can pick the right options based on requirements. Use the quiz questions to help reinforce this.

- Make unit 10 one or two scenarios with quiz questions. Really test the learner to ensure they understand when the various connectivity types apply in various scenarios. Include decision points around cost, performance, security, redundancy, and plans for growth. **My thoughts were to run through the above for each architectural pattern anyway, I've tweaked the unit slightly**
