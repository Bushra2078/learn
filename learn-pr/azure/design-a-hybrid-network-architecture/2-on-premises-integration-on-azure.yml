  questions:
  - content: 'Where is a point-to-site VPN connection established?'
    choices:
    - content: The VPN Gateway initializes the connection
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The VPN gateway is a bridge between on-premises/local to the cloud not where the connection is established.
    - content: From the host machine
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A point-to-site connection needs a connection to be established to connect into a host machine.
    - content: From a client computer
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Point-to-site connections get established from a client machine, such as a desktop pc connecting to the vpn. 
    - content: In the Azure virtual network
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An Azure virtual network is a virtual communication channel not where a VPN connection is established.
  - content: 'How is a site-to-site VPN authenticated?'
    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Authentication between sites is required for secure communications in the network. 
    - content: Using an administrator account

      explanation: Service principals are used for authentication but not in a site-to-site vpn connection.
    - content: Using an ASCII string secret
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: An ASCII string secret is used to authenticate between the vpn device and the vpn gateway.
  - content: 'When connecting to Azure using a VPN, which connection method would you use?'
    choices:
    - content: A VPN Gateway
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A VPN Gateway must be provisioned to bridge the connection between on-premises and Azure.
    - content: An encrypted connection
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All Azure vpn connections get encrypted automatically, there is no requirement on a user to enable this.
    - content: An Azure Virtual Machine
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Several Azure VMs are used to host VPN connections but this is transparent to a user.
    - content: A VPN tunnel
      isCorrect: false
