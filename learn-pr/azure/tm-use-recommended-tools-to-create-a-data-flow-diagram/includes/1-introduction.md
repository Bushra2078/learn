A data-flow diagram is a graphical representation of how your system works. It includes all data stores, processes, external entities, trust boundaries, and data-flows.

Threat modeling takes your data-flow diagram and applies a framework to help find threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk.

You can use any canvas, physical or virtual, to create a data-flow diagram. However, you do need a working knowledge of threat modeling to analyze it properly.

There are 3 tools Microsoft engineers often use for their threat modeling work, and will be discussed in this module.
