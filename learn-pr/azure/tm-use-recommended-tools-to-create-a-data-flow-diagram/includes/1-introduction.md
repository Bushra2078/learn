A data-flow diagram is a graphical representation of how your system works. It includes all data stores, processes, external entities, trust boundaries, and data-flows.

## What It's About

You can use any canvas, physical or virtual, to create a data-flow diagram. However, you do need a working knowledge of threat modeling to analyze it properly.

Some applications provide you with the tools to help create a data-flow diagram with a threat generation engine and risk reduction strategies.

Other tools provide you only with the ability to create a data-flow diagram.

## What's the Main Goal?

The goal of this learning path is to teach you the fundamentals of threat modeling for you to threat model anywhere, on any canvas.

To help you get there, we recommend a few tools along the way.
