Threats Manager Platform is a tool based on the idea that threat modeling is a flexible and dynamic experience, integrated with present, and future development processes to help anyone find and resolve threats in their service.

The tool was developed as a personal project by a threat modeling expert at Microsoft. The goal was to help technical consultants create and analyze threat models for their customers.

## Who Can Use the Threats Manager Platform?

- Engineers with limited security knowledge enjoy a simplified and guided experience, specialized templates, and features that enable specific scenarios.
- Engineers with more security depth can use existing features to help increase process efficiency and improve communication.
- Project managers also enjoy a tighter integration with their DevOps platform of choice and view the risk profile for all solutions they manage.
