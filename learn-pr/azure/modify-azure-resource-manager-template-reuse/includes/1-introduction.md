Azure Resource Manager templates provide a few features that help with deploying a template to different environments.

Suppose you are managing a software team that is developing an inventory system for your partner companies. Each environment that the software will be deployed to will have different policies implemented through different Azure storage account SKU. You have an Azure Resource Manager template that deploys a storage account and can be run on each environment, but you would like it to be easier to to change inputs for each deployment environment. You decide to use variables and functions in the template and parameter files for inputs.

In this module, you make your Azure Resource Manager template easier to reuse for different environments by adding variables and functions. You also add better tracking and organization of your deployed resources using tags and complete the journey to more flexible deployments with parameter files.
