# Module Design

## Title

*Build a scalable application with virtual machine scale sets*

## Role(s)

- Solution architect

## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Azure virtual machine scale sets
- Azure custom script extension

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure virtual machines
- Basic knowledge of load balancing concepts

## Summary

Enhance your application to automatically adjust to changes in load and minimize costs with Azure virtual machine scale sets.

## Learning objectives

1. Identify the features and capabilities of virtual machine scale sets 
1. Identify the use cases for running applications on virtual machine scale sets 
1. Deploy an application on a virtual machine scale set 

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
||||||

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice (from the module proposal):

    *Add your scenario [(Guidance)](id-guidance-scenarios.md)*

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type
    
 1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    1. Step
    1. Step

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

## Notes
Create VMSS - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/tutorial-create-and-manage-cli  
Install and upgrade an application on VMSS - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/tutorial-install-apps-cli  

We currently don't have scale sets enabled in sandbox, so the learner may have to use their own subscription. Go ahead and design as if we had sandbox, and we'll adjust later as needed.
