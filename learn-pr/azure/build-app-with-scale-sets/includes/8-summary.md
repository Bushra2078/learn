In this module, you looked at the features of virtual machine scale sets. You saw how to manually scale a scale set, and configure a scale set to autoscale – based on a schedule – or by using performance metrics. You also learned how to use a custom extension script to deploy and update an application across the virtual machines in a scale set.
