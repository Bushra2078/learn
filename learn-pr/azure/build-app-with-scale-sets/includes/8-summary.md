This module explained the features of virtual machines scale sets. It described how to manually scale a scale set, as well as how to configure a scale set to autoscale, based upon a schedule, or by using performance metrics. Additionally, you learned how to use a custom extension script to deploy and update an application across the virtual machines in a scale set.
