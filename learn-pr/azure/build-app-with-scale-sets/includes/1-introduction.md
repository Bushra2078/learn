Managing virtual machines at scale can be challenging, especially when your users' usage patterns vary and demand on applications fluctuate. You want to be able to increase and decrease your virtual machine resources to match these demands while keeping a consistent virtual machine configuration to ensure application stability. This way, you maintain throughput and responsiveness while minimizing the costs associated with continually running a large collection of virtual machines.

Imagine that you work for a domestic shipping company. Your customers use one of the company's websites to manage and check the status of their shipments. This website is deployed to virtual machines and hosted on-premises. You've noticed an uptake on usage on the site that is placing strain on the virtual machines' resources. However, you can't adjust to fluctuations in load without manually intervening, and creating new virtual machines or deallocating existing virtual machines. You decide to move the application to Azure and need a solution that automatically handles fluctuations in load, and ensures consistent performance of the website. You also need to quickly roll out application updates to these servers while minimizing impact to end-users.

We'll learn how a virtual machine scale set helps address the challenges mentioned above of load balancing a web application in this module.
