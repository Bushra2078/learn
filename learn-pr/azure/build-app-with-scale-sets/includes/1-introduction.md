**Introduction**

A domestic shipping company has a web site that customers can use to manage and check the status of their shipments. This site currently runs on virtual machines on-premises, and the company is moving this application to Azure. They currently have a fixed capacity on-premises and are unable to adjust to fluctuations in load without manually intervening and creating or deallocating virtual machines. They need a solution that will automatically handle these fluctuations in load to ensure consistent performance for their web site. They also need a way to quickly roll out application updates to the servers while minimizing impact to end users.
