In this module, you learned about Azure virtual machine scale sets, a service that provides you with a scalable way to run applications on a set of virtual machines (VMs). The VMs in a virtual machine scale sets all have the same configuration and run the same applications. As demand grows, the number of VMs running in the scale set increases. As demand decreases, excess VMs can be shut down. Virtual machine scale sets are ideal for scenarios that include compute workloads, big-data workloads, and container workloads.
