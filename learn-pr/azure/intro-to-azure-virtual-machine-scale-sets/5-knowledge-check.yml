  questions:
  - content: "Rather than deploy new instances as load increases on the application hosted in a virtual machine scale set, you want to increase the CPU capacity of each existing instance. Which of the following types of scaling would you perform to achieve this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Vertical scaling"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Vertical scaling increases the capacity of instances within a virtual machine scale set."
    - content: "Horizontal scaling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Horizontal scaling increases the number of instances within a virtual machine scale set."
    - content: "Load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Load balancing distributes traffic across instances in a virtual machine scale set, it doesn't alter the number or performance of instances within the virtual machine scale sets."
  - content: "Which of these should be the basis for autoscaling a business critical application that experiences surges in utilization at unpredictable times during the week?"
    choices:
    - content: "Autoscale according to schedule"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. As the surges in utilization are unpredictable, scaling according to a schedule won't result in an application that is responsive to user numbers."
    - content: "Autoscale according to metrics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Configuring autoscale according to metrics will have the application be responsible for utilization, which meets the goals outlined in the question."
    - content: "Low priority scale set"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Low priority scale sets allow you to have applications scale using spare capacity. As capacity may be diminished according to constraints beyond your control, you should avoid using low priority scale sets for business critical applications."      
  - content: "What is the maximum number of Linux IaaS VMs in an Azure virtual machine scale sets?"
    choices:
    - content: "1000"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The maximum number of IaaS VMs in an Azure virtual machine scale sets is 1000."
    - content: "1024"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maximum number of IaaS VMs in an Azure virtual machine scale sets is 1000."
    - content: "2056"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maximum number of IaaS VMs in an Azure virtual machine scale sets is 1000."
