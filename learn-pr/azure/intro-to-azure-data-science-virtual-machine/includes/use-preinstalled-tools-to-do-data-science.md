Now that you are connected to your Data Science Virtual Machine, you can begin using it to do data science. 

The Data Science Virtual Machine comes with tools preinstalled for:

- Python
- R
- Julia
- Node.js
- Java

You can, of course, add additional programming languages, desktop applications, database tools, and so forth.

## Run RStudio remotely

From the Data Science Virtual Machine desktop running in your XFCE client, click on the RStudio icon.

When RStudio completes startup, enter `demo(graphics)` in the Console window to see a demonstration of RStudio's graphing capabilities.

Because the Data Science Virtual Machine you've created in this module is sandboxed, it cannot access outside resources, such as the data files needed for the included Python Jupyter notebooks.
