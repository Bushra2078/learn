Suppose you work for a company doing medical research and you're responsible for managing the on-premises servers. The servers you administer run all the company infrastructure, from web servers to databases. However, the hardware is aging and starting to struggle to keep up with some of the new data analysis applications being deployed to it.

You could upgrade all the hardware, but that's not appealing for several reasons:

1. The servers are physically scattered all around the world with minimal staff in each location. We'd like to centralize the upgrade to our home office.

1. The company runs custom data analysis software on several versions and flavors of Windows and Linux, sometimes set up with odd configurations that aren't entirely understood. We need a way to test our deployments completely and try different configurations to make sure everything is working before we transition the work.
