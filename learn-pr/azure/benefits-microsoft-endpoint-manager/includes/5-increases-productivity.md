By implementing a management infrastructure, you can provide IT services, apps, protection, and configuration to your end users to make them extremely productive. For instance, end users can automatically get their certs, WIFI profiles, and VPN settings without having to manually configure them. This allows end users be more productive because they don't have to do any manual configuration, but it also helps end users be protected because they have the right settings.
