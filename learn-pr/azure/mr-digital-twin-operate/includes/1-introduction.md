Visualizing assets in an immersive setting permits users to experience the right data in the right context, at the right time.  Adding connectivity of your assets to operations data makes your assets more intelligent and reflective of physical assets or processes.  When real-world operating data is connected to digital assets (live or historic IoT data), users are able to visualize operating conditions, identify anomalies in performance or equipment health / integrity, determine trends and patterns in data over time, and ultimately simulate future conditions or operations situations. In this unit, you will connect your wind turbines to a stream of ADT data for visualization and interaction on the HoloLens 2.  This is the true power of the Digital Twin.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Connect to a Digital Twin data source on Azure
- Stream telemetry data to assets in your Unity scene, using Azure services, including ADT
- Visualize the data on a HoloLens 2 via SignalR
- Experience and understand the power of Azure Digital Twins
- Use Mixed Reality to operate a wind farm
