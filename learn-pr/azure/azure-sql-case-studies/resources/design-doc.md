# Title

Azure SQL - Solve challenges  
(Azure SQL fundamentals learning path 6/6)

## Role(s)

- Data Engineer
- Solution Architect
- Developer
- Technology manager

## Level

- Advanced

## Product(s)

- Azure SQL Database
- Azure SQL Managed Instance
- Azure VM
- Azure Data Studio
- SSMS
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI

## Prerequisites

- Understand and are experienced in working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server. If you are new to this, you can review the following book by Bob Ward: [Pro SQL Server on Linux.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pro-sql-server/9781484241288/) This book (available online) introduces SQL Server on Linux, but in the process walks through fundamental SQL Server topics
- Familiarity with the general structure of Azure will be helpful, but not required. The [Azure fundamentals learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) will help you understand the fundamentals of Azure at a general level (not data focused).  
- Complete the **Introduction to Azure SQL**, **Azure SQL - Deploy and Configure**, **Azure SQL - Securing your data**, **Azure SQL - Deliver consistent performance**, and **Azure SQL - Achieve high availability** modules as part of the **Azure SQL Learning Path** (highly recommended but not required).  

## Summary

In this hands-on, scenario-driven module, you'll apply your existing SQL Server expertise to Azure SQL including Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instance. In this module, you will validate and expand your Azure SQL expertise with a challenging problem-solution exercise. You'll then broaden your horizons to the many other opportunities and resources for personal and corporate growth that Azure offers. 

## Learning objectives

After this module, you should be able to:
<br>

- Determine which Azure SQL deployment option (virtual machines, single databases, serverless databases, elastic pools of databases, hyperscale databases, and managed instances) and service tier should be used for scenarios that meet the needs of your application.
- Analyze and address security, performance, and availability scenarios in Azure SQL using both familiar and new tools and techniques.
- Harness the "power of the cloud" including automation and intelligent capabilities of Azure SQL.
- Translate your existing SQL Server expertise to Azure SQL expertise.  

The goal of this module is to train experienced SQL Server professionals.
