Once a given workload or application is up and running with Azure SQL, and you've configured according to what you've learned in the learning path, you may be wondering what other things you can take advantage of in Azure.

Fortunately, Azure SQL is not the 'end' of your Azure journey. There are many other Azure services that can connect to Azure SQL to help you build more performant and intelligent applications.

If you look at an Azure SQL Database, for example, in the Azure portal, you can see that there are other services that are already integrated with Azure SQL. One example of such integrations is the Power Platform.

Azure SQL Database integration with the Power Platform is going to make it easier for you to connect to SQL data with Power BI (for example, with DirectQuery). It's also going to make it easier for you to easily build applications with little or no code leveraging Power Apps and deploying for use on any device. Finally, Power Automate is going to help you get more out of Azure by enabling you to create automated workflows in minutes across apps and services, such as alerting, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, Office 365, SharePoint, and more.

The Power Platform is just one example of how you can go further from Azure SQL. There are also integrations and connectors around Azure Search (this includes Azure Cognitive Search) and Azure Stream Analytics. Even for services where there aren't specific integrations, all the Azure services are built on the Azure backbone (largely Azure Service Fabric) and can be configured to talk to each other efficiently.

And for your workloads that remain on-premises, there are many technologies and strategies for making the communication with, for example, SQL Server on-premises, fast and effective. You learned about some of those networking options in the security module, but there are more things you can do to make it not only more secure, but also faster and with lower latency. Technologies like ExpressRoute, which gives you a direct line to Azure, can enable you to be successful wherever you are in your Azure journey.
