You now know how to get a workload or application up and running with Azure SQL. You also know how to configure it according to what you've learned in the learning path related to security, performance, and availability. You might be wondering what other things you can take advantage of in Azure.

## Azure SQL is the world's database

Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, once claimed that Azure is the world's computer. With the combination of stability and innovation that comes from the SQL Server and Azure SQL platform, Azure SQL has become the world's database. After you're on Azure SQL, you can connect and integrate with other services in Azure, as well as to your on-premises environment.

### Integration with other services

Azure SQL is not the end of your Azure journey. Many other Azure services can connect to Azure SQL to help you build more performant and intelligent applications.

Azure SQL Database, for example, integrates with many other services. For example, the integration of Azure SQL Database with Microsoft Power Platform can make it easier for you to:

- Connect to SQL data with Power BI (such as through DirectQuery).
- Build no-code applications with Power Apps.
- Create automated workflows across apps and services with Power Automate.

Microsoft Power Platform is just one example of how you can go beyond Azure SQL. There are also integrations and connectors around Azure Cognitive Search and Azure Stream Analytics. Even services where there aren't specific integrations are built on the Azure backbone (largely Azure Service Fabric). You can configure them to talk to each other efficiently.

### Extension of on-premises

For your workloads that remain on-premises, there are many technologies and strategies for making the communication with SQL Server on-premises (for example) fast and effective. You learned about some of those networking options in the security module. But there are more things you can do to make the communication not only more secure, but also faster and with lower latency. Technologies like Azure ExpressRoute, which gives you a direct line to Azure, can help you be successful wherever you are in your Azure journey.

Regardless of where you are in your cloud journey and the scenario that presents itself, Azure SQL has capabilities that you can consider. You've now learned about these capabilities. You can use them in building new or modernized applications by integrating with other Azure services or your on-premises estate.
