Once a given workload or application is up and running with Azure SQL, and you've configured according to what you've learned in the learning path related to security, performance, and availability, you may be wondering what other things you can take advantage of in Azure.

## Azure SQL is the world's database

Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, once claimed that Azure is the world's computer. With the combination of stability and innovation that comes from the SQL Server and Azure SQL platform, Azure SQL has become the world's database. Once you're on Azure SQL, you can connect and integrate with other services in Azure, as well as to your on-premises environment.

### Integration with other services

Fortunately, Azure SQL is not the 'end' of your Azure journey. There are many other Azure services that can connect to Azure SQL to help you build more performant and intelligent applications.

If you consider an Azure SQL Database, for example, many integrations exist with other services. One example of such integrations is the Power Platform. Azure SQL Database's integration with the Power Platform is going to make it easier for you to connect to SQL data with Power BI (for example, with DirectQuery), build no-code applications with Power Apps, and create automated workflows across apps and services with Power Automate.

The Power Platform is just one example of how you can go further from Azure SQL. There are also integrations and connectors around Azure Search (this includes Azure Cognitive Search) and Azure Stream Analytics. Even for services where there aren't specific integrations, all the Azure services are built on the Azure backbone (largely Azure Service Fabric) and can be configured to talk to each other efficiently.

### Extension of on-premises

For your workloads that remain on-premises, there are many technologies and strategies for making the communication with, for example, SQL Server on-premises, fast and effective. You learned about some of those networking options in the security module, but there are more things you can do to make it not only more secure, but also faster and with lower latency. Technologies like ExpressRoute, which gives you a direct line to Azure, can enable you to be successful wherever you are in your Azure journey.

Regardless of where you are in your cloud journey and the scenario that presents itself, Azure SQL has great capabilities that it can bring to the table. You've now learned about these capabilities, and can leverage them in building new or modernized applications, integrating with other Azure services or your on-premises estate.
