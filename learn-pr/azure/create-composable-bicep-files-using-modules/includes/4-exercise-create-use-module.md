You've been tasked with adding a content delivery network, or CDN, to your company's toy wombat launch website. However, other teams in your company have told you they don't need a CDN. In this exercise, you'll create modules for the website and the CDN, and you'll add the modules to a template.

During the process, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add a module for your application.
> * Create a Bicep template that uses the module.
> * Add another module for the CDN.
> * Add the CDN module to your template, while making it optional.
> * Deploy the template to Azure.
> * Review the deployment history.

[!INCLUDE [Install the Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code](../../includes/azure-template-bicep-exercise-vscode-extension.md)]

## Create a blank Bicep file

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a new file called *main.bicep*.

1. Save the empty file so that Visual Studio Code loads the Bicep tooling. 
 
   You can either select **File** > **Save As** or select <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> in Windows (<kbd>âŒ˜+S</kbd> on macOS). Be sure to remember where you've saved the file. For example, you might want to create a *templates* folder to save it in.

## Create a module for your application

1. Create a new folder called *modules* in the same folder where you created your *main.bicep* file. In the *modules* folder, create a file called *app.bicep*. Save the file.

1. Add the following content into the *app.bicep* file:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-app.bicep" :::

   This file deploys an Azure App Service plan and an app. Notice that the module is fairly generic - it doesn't include any assumptions about the names of resources, or the SKU of the App Service plan. This makes it easy to reuse the module for different deployments.

1. Save the changes to the file.

## Add the module to your Bicep template

Here, you add the *app* module to your Bicep template as a starting point.

1. Open the *main.bicep* file.

1. Add the following parameters and variable to the file:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-1.bicep" range="1-10" :::

   Because this is the template you intend to deploy for your toy websites, it's a little more specific. The App Service plan name is defined as a variable, and the SKU parameter has a default value that makes sense for the toy launch website.

1. Below the parameters, create a blank line. Now, type the first line of the app module definition:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-1.bicep" range="12" :::

   As you type, notice that the Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code helps you to scaffold the module declaration. When you type the path to your module and type the `=` character, it displays a popup with several options will appear.

1. Select the **Required properties** item from the popup menu:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-module-scaffold.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing the option to scaffold a module with its required properties.":::

1. Complete the module declaration:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-1.bicep" range="12-20" :::

1. At the bottom of the file, define an output:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-1.bicep" range="22-23" :::

1. Save the changes to the file.

## Create a module for the content delivery network

1. In the *modules* folder, create a file called *cdn.bicep*. Save the file.

1. Add the following content into the *cdn.bicep* file:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-cdn.bicep" :::

   This file deploys two resources: a CDN profile and a CDN endpoint.

1. Save the changes to the file.

## Add the modules to the main Bicep template

1. Open the *main.bicep* file.

1. Below the `appServicePlanSkuName` parameter, add the following parameter:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-2.bicep" range="10-11" :::

1. Below the `app` module definition, define the `cdn` module:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-2.bicep" range="25-32" :::

   Notice that the module has a condition so that it's only deployed when the `deployCdn` parameter's value is set to `true`. Also, notice that the module's `originHostName` parameter is set to the value of the `appServiceAppHostName` output from the `app` module.

1. Update the host name output so that it selects the correct host name. When a CDN is deployed, you want the host name to be that of CDN endpoint.

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-2.bicep" range="35" :::

1. Save the changes to the file.

## Deploy the Bicep template to Azure

::: zone pivot="cli"

[!INCLUDE [Bootstrapping instructions for first Bicep exercise - CLI](../../includes/azure-template-bicep-exercise-sandbox-deploy-cli.md)]

### Deploy the template to Azure

Run the following code from the terminal in Visual Studio Code to deploy the Bicep template to Azure. This can take a minute or two to complete, and then you'll see a successful deployment.

```azurecli
az deployment group create --template-file main.bicep
```

You'll see `Running...` in the terminal.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

[!INCLUDE [Bootstrapping instructions for first Bicep exercise - PowerShell](../../includes/azure-template-bicep-exercise-sandbox-deploy-powershell.md)]

### Deploy the template to Azure

Deploy the template to Azure by using the following Azure PowerShell command in the terminal. This can take a minute or two to complete, and then you'll see a successful deployment. 

```azurepowershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -TemplateFile main.bicep
```

::: zone-end

## Review the deployment history

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) and make sure you're in the sandbox subscription:

   1. Select your avatar in the upper-right corner of the page. 
   1. Select **Switch directory**. In the list, choose the **Microsoft Learn Sandbox** directory.

1. On the left-side panel, select **Resource groups**.

1. Select **<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>**.

1. In the left menu, select **Deployments**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-deployments.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the resource group, with the Deployments menu item highlighted." :::

   Three deployments are listed.

1. Select the **main** deployment and expand **Deployment details**.

   Notice that both of the modules are listed, and that their types are displayed as `Microsoft.Resources/deployments`. The modules are listed twice because their outputs are also referenced within the template.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-deployment-modules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the deployment details for the main deployment." :::

1. Select the **toy-launch-cdn** and **toy-launch-app** deployments and review the resources deployed in each. Notice that they correspond to the resources defined in the respective module.

## Test the website

1. Select the **toy-launch-app** deployment.

1. Select **Outputs**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-outputs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the deployment, with the Outputs menu item highlighted." :::

1. Select the copy button for the `appServiceAppHostName` output.

1. In a new browser tab, try to navigate to the address you copied in the previous step.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-web-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the web app's welcome page, with the address bar showing the App Service host name." :::

   The App Service welcome page is displayed, showing that you have successfully deployed the app.

1. Navigate to the **main** deployment and select **Outputs**.

1. Copy the value of the `websiteHostName` output. Notice that this host name is different, because it's an Azure CDN host name.

1. In a new browser tab, try to navigate to the CDN host name you copied in the previous step. Add `https://` to the start of the address.

   CDN endpoints take a few minutes to become active. If you see a *Page not found* error, you can wait a few minutes and try pasting the link again. Also, ensure you added `https://` to the start of the URL so that you're using HTTPS.

   When the CDN endpoint is active, you'll see the same App Service welcome page. This time, it's been served through Azure CDN, which helps to improve the website's performance.
