Your company's new toy wombat is a big success. However, the large amounts of traffic to the website was causing performance problems and customer complaints. You needed to add a content delivery network, or CDN, to the website to help it better support large amounts of load. You wanted to do this in a reusable and composable way, because you knew that other websites and other projects in your company would also need a CDN in the future.

In this module, you learned how to create and use Bicep modules to make your Bicep code reusable, better structured, and composable. You learned about the importance of creating good parameters and outputs for your modules to ensure they're easily to chain together and compose into other templates, or even other modules. You also learned how conditions can help add flexibility to your modules.

Now, you can easily add a CDN into any of the websites you create, whether they are deployed from your website's main template or not.
