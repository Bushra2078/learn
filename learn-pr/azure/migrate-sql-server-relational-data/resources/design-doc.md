## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    Your organization is moving out of your on-premises data center, and has several databases running on SQL Server. You will be migrating these databases to Azure SQL Database for the reduced costs and operational resources required for these systems. You need to plan a migration for these databases to Azure SQL Database, and need to select the proper migration strategy and tools to use to perform this migration. You need to decide whether to use migration with downtime or transactional replication to migrate your data.

1. **Exercise - Environment setup**

    Exercise unit to kick off the setup of the systems needed for the exercise. This should be a single command to deploy a template for a SQL Server on a Windows VM, with a sample database configured. This should also deploy an instance of Azure SQL Database.

1. **Migration process overview**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *Describe the elements of the migration process*:

    - Pre-migration
        - Discover: Inventory database assets, and application stack discovery.
        - Assess: Assess workloads and fix recommendations.
        - Convert: Convert the source schema to work in the target environment. This is only relevant for heterogeneous migrations.
    - Migration
        - Migrate schema, data, and objects: Migrate the source schema, and then migrate the source data to the target.
        - Sync data: Sync your target schema and data with the source. This is only relevant for minimal-downtime migrations.
        - Cutover: Cut over from the source to the target environment. This is only relevant for minimal-downtime migrations.
    - Post-migration
        - Remediate applications: Iteratively make any necessary changes to your applications.
        - Perform Tests: Iteratively run functional and performance tests.
        - Optimize: Based on the tests you performed, address any performance issues, and then retest to confirm the performance improvements.

    Migration details

    - What is included and what is not included in the migration process
    - Tools and services that are used
        - Data Migration Assistant
        - Azure Database Migration Service
    - Migration with downtime details
    - Migration with transactional replication details

    **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *Describe the elements of the migration process*?

    - Why is the post-migration stage an important part of a successful migration plan?
    - Which migration strategy is the best choice for a given scenario?

1. **Exercise - Assess database with the Data Migration Assistant**

    Perform an assessment to ensure the source database is compatible with Azure SQL Database. Steps to follow should reference https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-azure-sql#assess-your-on-premises-database.

    1. Download and install the [Data Migration Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53595)
    1. Create an assessment
    1. Review assessment results
    1. Prepare any necessary fixes as TSQL scripts

1. **Migration with downtime**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *Choose when to use migration with downtime*:

    - Overview of the migration process
        - Assess your on-premises database by using the Data Migration Assistant.
        - Migrate the sample schema by using the Data Migration Assistant.
        - Create an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service.
        - Create a migration project by using the Azure Database Migration Service.
        - Run the migration.
        - Monitor the migration.
        - Download a migration report.
    - Selecting downtime tolerance
        - Migrate offline
        - Migrate online

    **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *Choose when to use migration with downtime*?

    - Which migration downtime option is the best choice for a given scenario?
    - Which service is used to perform the data migration?

1. **Exercise - Migrate a database with downtime**

    Source exercise steps from [Tutorial: Migrate SQL Server to a single database or pooled database in Azure SQL Database *offline* using DMS](/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-azure-sql)

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

## Notes

Much of the detail in unit 3 is based on the graphic from https://datamigration.microsoft.com/, click on *Migration overview* at the top of the page.

[This template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-azure-database-migration-service) has examples of setting up several of the resources necessary for this exercise, though shouldn't be used on as it's currently presented. We may need to use the SQL2014SP2/WS2012R2 marketplace image to ensure that the deployment happens in a timely manner. This took about 8 minutes in a trial run in my own subscription.

Content is based on the [SQL Server database migration to Azure SQL Database](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-single-database-migrate) article.
