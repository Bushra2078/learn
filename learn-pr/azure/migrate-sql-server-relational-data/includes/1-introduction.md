The Azure Data Migration Service automates the task of migrating your databases to the Azure SQL Database service. 

Suppose you work for a company that aggregates social media links to provide recommendations to users of its website. The current infrastructure is having problems scaling up to handle the current demands. In addition, it is becoming more expensive to maintain as the equipment ages.

As both a cost-saving measure and to provide a platform for rapid growth in the future, management has decided to migrate their Windows-based SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database. As the IT resource in charge of the database, you have been tasked with migrating your SQL Server database, hosted in a Windows virtual machine in Azure, to the Azure SQL Database service.

In this module, you will learn how to use the Azure Data Migration Service to accomplish the move to the Azure SQL Database. First, you'll see how to use the Azure Data Migration Assistant to examine your existing database for any compatibility issues with Azure SQL. You'll then use it to migrate the database to Azure SQL.
