Analyzing a migration consideration involves looking at the various options available. The previous article mentioned the hosting services such as IaaS and PaaS. IaaS migration can provide a lift and shift option where you create a virtual machine (VM), configure it with the same software and settings as your on-premises environment, and then host it in Azure. IaaS still requires your organization to manage, patch, update, and secure the software on the VM.

When you have an ASP.NET application that you want to migrate, consider using the PaaS option to achieve the greatest amount of benefit from the automation and scalability on Azure. For the PaaS solution with ASP.NET applications, the discussion turns to using the Azure App Service.
