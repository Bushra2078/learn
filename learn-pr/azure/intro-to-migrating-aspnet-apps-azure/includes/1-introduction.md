Tailwind Traders have hosted web applications on their own internal infrastructure by using computers running Windows Server, Internet Information Servics (IIS), and Microsoft SQL Server. Beyond the initial effort and costs, these applications incur ongoing maintenance costs in terms of hardware, operating system updates, and licensing costs. These maintenance costs make Azure APp Service an attractive alternative.

Migrating ASP.NET applications and any associated SQL Server database, to Microsoft Azure and Azure SQL Database, may be an option you are considering. Before jumping into the actual process of migrating apps and data, careful consideration and assessment of your existing environment, apps, and requirements, will go a long way to helping ensure a successful migration.

As part of the migration consideration, senior leadership has asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to evaluate a migration scenario. They would like you to present information about any potential issues that may prevent a successful migration.  This information must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals. You will be introduced to various migration assistance tools that can be used to provide the necessary supporting recommendations for an ASP.NET app migration, including data, to Azure.

Guidance for all content:

 - Ignore the linter warning about how the first line of a unit should be a header. The platform renders the unit title as an H1 at the top. All headers used in content should be H2 or smaller.
 - Links to other content (in Learn, Docs or anywhere else), put them in a section in the final Summary unit called "Learn more" or "Further reading" or something similar. If you need to mention the external resources in the content, indicate to the user that links are located at the end of the module.
- All content, including images, must be original and not copied from Docs or anywhere else.
- Screenshots: see https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-create-screenshot?branch=master for requirements and guidance.
- Conceptual images and diagrams: Don't spend lots of time creating polished diagrams. Work with the Learn team to submit a conceptual image creation request if new art is needed.
- Video: Work with your contact on the Learn team.
- Zone pivots: See https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/unit-add-zone-pivots?branch=master
- Think carefully about the knowledge prerequisites you declare for your content, and use them to shape the content and keep the scope reasonable. In both conceptual content and exercise steps, don't dwell on things you expect the reader to already know and understand.
- Feel free to use HTML comments like these during authoring. They show up in published content as HTML comments - the platform doesn't render them on the page, but they are present in the pae source, so remove them all before publishing.

Guidance for content and exercise units:

- Most standard content should generally follow a pattern of alternating between "content" units and "exercise" units. See https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-standardmodules?branch=master
- Don't include a summary section in individual units
- Don't include a sentence or section to transition to the next unit. The platform will insert the name of the next unit above the navigation button at the bottom
