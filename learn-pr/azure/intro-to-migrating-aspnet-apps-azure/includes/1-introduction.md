Migrating  a Microsoft ASP.NET application from on-premises to Microsoft Azure, along with a supporting Azure SQL database can provide many advantages, but also challenges. Learn how to evaluate the migration process to determine if it’s right for your application.

Tailwind Traders have hosted web applications on their own internal infrastructure by using servers running Windows Server, Internet Information Services (IIS), and Microsoft SQL Server. Beyond the initial effort and costs, these applications incur ongoing maintenance costs in terms of hardware, operating system updates, and licensing costs. These maintenance costs make Microsoft Azure App Service an attractive alternative.

You might be considering the option of migrating Microsoft ASP.NET applications and any associated SQL Server database to App Service and Azure SQL Database . Before proceeding with  the actual process of migrating apps and data, you should carefully consider and assess your existing environment, apps, and requirements to ensure a successful migration.

As part of the migration consideration, senior leadership has asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to evaluate a migration scenario. They would like you to present information about any potential issues that might prevent a successful migration.  This information must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals. 

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to identify the various migration assistance tools that you can use to provide the necessary supporting recommendations for an ASP.NET app migration, including data, to Azure.
