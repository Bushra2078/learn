Tailwind Traders have hosted web applications on their own internal infrastructure by using servers running Windows Server, Internet Information Services (IIS), and Microsoft SQL Server. Beyond the initial effort and costs, these applications incur ongoing maintenance costs in terms of hardware, operating system updates, and licensing costs. These maintenance costs make Azure App Service an attractive alternative.


Migrating ASP.NET applications and any associated SQL Server database, to Microsoft Azure and Azure SQL Database, may be an option you are considering. Before jumping into the actual process of migrating apps and data, careful consideration and assessment of your existing environment, apps, and requirements, will go a long way to helping ensure a successful migration.

As part of the migration consideration, senior leadership has asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to evaluate a migration scenario. They would like you to present information about any potential issues that may prevent a successful migration.  This information must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals. You will be introduced to various migration assistance tools that can be used to provide the necessary supporting recommendations for an ASP.NET app migration, including data, to Azure.
