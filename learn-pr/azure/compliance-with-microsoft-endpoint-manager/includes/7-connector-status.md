You can use the connector status pane as a one-stop location to review the status of all available connectors for Intune.  

Connectors are connections you configure to external services. For example, the *Apple Volume Purchase Program* service or the *Windows Autopilot* service.  Status for this type of connector is based on the last successful synchronization time. Connectors are also cCertificates or credentials that are required to connect to an external unmanaged service* like *Apple Push Notification Services* (APNS) certificates. Status for this type of connector is based on the expiry timestamp of the certificate or credential.
