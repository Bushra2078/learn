You can use Microsoft Intune to manage the devices and apps that your company's workforce uses. At times, you'll need to verify the health of these devices and apps. Fortunately, there are a number of resources you can use to resolve compliance issues for end user's devices and apps, as well as your tenant.

Suppose that you're the administrator of a company with several thousand employees. You have multiple issues that you must check. First, you need to make sure your tenant is running successfully by using the Intune tenant status page. Next, you want to check the status for an end user that is having problems by using the troubleshooting portal within Intune. The third thing you want to check is the overall enrollment status of all the end users for your tenant using an Intune report.
