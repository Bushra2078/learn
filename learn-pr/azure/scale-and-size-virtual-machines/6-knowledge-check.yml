  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "True or false: when you're using virtual machine scale sets with autoscale, the autoscale rules can be configured to change the _size_ of the virtual machines in your scale set."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Autoscale changes the number of instances in your scale set. It does not change the size of the instances."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Autoscale changes the number of instances in your scale set. It does not change the size of the instances."

  - content: "What is typically the most important criterion to use when you're choosing a _type_ for your virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your workload; that is, the kind of operations you expect the virtual machine to perform most often."
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Virtual machine _type_ describes the mix of CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and networking bandwidth allocated to a VM. Your goal is to find the best match of resources for your workload."
    - content: "The brand of the underlying hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Virtual machine _type_ describes the mix of CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and networking bandwidth allocated to a VM. Your goal is to find the best match of resources for your workload."
    - content: "The operating systems and images that the type supports."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Virtual machine _type_ describes the mix of CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and networking bandwidth allocated to a VM. Your goal is to find the best match of resources for your workload."
       
  - content: "Suppose you work for a government department responsible for severe-weather alerts. You can achieve the performance you need by using one large VM or two small VMs with a load balancer. Which configuration is likely to be a better choice?"
    choices:
    - content: "One VM"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "A configuration with multiple VMs is appropriate because it provides redundancy. If one of the VMs crashes, the other can continue to service requests."
    - content: "Two VMs and a load balancer"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "A configuration with multiple VMs is appropriate because it provides redundancy. If one of the VMs crashes, the other can continue to service requests."
