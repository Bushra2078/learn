## Outline

Modules are organized in pairs of units: a conceptual unit followed by an exercise unit.

- Introduction
- Design an API for Azure Functions
- Exercise - Build and deploy an API operation in a function
  - Run a script to deploy a Cosmos DB and populate data
  - Start a new Functions project in VS Code, deploy first function
- Add database connectivity.
  - Where to get the connection string and where to configure it; options for using Cosmos (binding, code).
- Exercise: Add database connectivity.
- Configure Functions keys and enable CORS
- Exercise - Configure Functions keys and enable CORS
  - What can we do in the exercise so the user can experience what this actually accomplishes? Something that will fail prior to correcting the configuration, then succeed. A tiny sample app may be a good idea; we could use it for other stuff in previous units as well.
- Summary

## Etc

- TypeScript or JavaScript?
