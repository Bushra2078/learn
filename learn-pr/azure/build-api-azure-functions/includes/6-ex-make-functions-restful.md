The Products Manager API is about to get serious style upgrade courtesy of you - fake Tailwind Traders developer extroidinaire. In this exercise, you'll turn all of the functions you created earlier into RESTful ones by modifying their configuration files.

1. Open the `api/GetProducts/function.json` file.

1. Modify the "methods" property so that it only contains the value "get".

   ```json
   "methods": ["get"]
   ```

1. Below the "methods" line, add a line that specifies a route of "products" for the GetProducts method.

   ```json
   "route": "products"
   ```

   Your `function.json` file for "GetProducts" should now look like this...

   ```json
   {
     "bindings": [
       {
         "authLevel": "function",
         "type": "httpTrigger",
         "direction": "in",
         "name": "req",
         "methods": ["get"],
         "route": "products"
       },
       {
         "type": "http",
         "direction": "out",
         "name": "res"
       }
     ],
     "scriptFile": "../dist/GetProducts/index.js"
   }
   ```

1. Save the file.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Saving the file will cause the Azure Functions process to terminate the debugger will disconnect. Don't be alarmed. You didn't break anything. It's just that you've made fundamental changes to how the functions are served up, so you'll have to restart the project when you're done with all this REST spring cleaning.

## Make the CreateProduct function RESTful

1. Open the `api/CreatProducts/function.json` file.

1. Restrict the allowed "methods" to just "post".

   ```json
   "methods": ["post"]
   ```

1. Below the "methods" line, add a line that specifies a new route for the CreateProduct method as "product".

   ```json
   "route": "product"
   ```

   Your `function.json` file for CreateProducts should now look like this...

   ```json
   {
     "bindings": [
       {
         "authLevel": "function",
         "type": "httpTrigger",
         "direction": "in",
         "name": "req",
         "methods": ["post"],
         "route": "product"
       },
       {
         "type": "http",
         "direction": "out",
         "name": "res"
       }
     ],
     "scriptFile": "../dist/CreateProduct/index.js"
   }
   ```

## Make the UpdateProduct function RESTful

1. Open the "api/UpdateProduct/function.json" file.

1. Restrict the allowed "methods" to just "put".

   ```json
    "methods": ["put"]
   ```

1. Below the "methods" line, add a line that specifies a new route for the UpdateProduct method as "product".

   ```json
   "route": "product"
   ```

   Your `function.json` file for UpdateProduct should now look like this...

   ```json
   {
     "bindings": [
       {
         "authLevel": "function",
         "type": "httpTrigger",
         "direction": "in",
         "name": "req",
         "methods": ["put"],
         "route": "product"
       },
       {
         "type": "http",
         "direction": "out",
         "name": "res"
       }
     ],
     "scriptFile": "../dist/UpdateProduct/index.js"
   }
   ```

## Make the DeleteProduct function RESTful

1. Open the "api/DeleteProduct/function.json" file.

1. Restrict the allowed "methods" to just "delete".

   ```json
    "methods": ["delete"]
   ```

1. Below the "methods" line, add a line that specifies a new route for the DeleteProduct method.

   ```json
   "route": "product/{id}"
   ```

   Your `function.json` file for DeleteProduct should now look like this...

   ```json
   {
     "bindings": [
       {
         "authLevel": "function",
         "type": "httpTrigger",
         "direction": "in",
         "name": "req",
         "methods": ["delete"],
         "route": "product/{id}"
       },
       {
         "type": "http",
         "direction": "out",
         "name": "res"
       }
     ],
     "scriptFile": "../dist/DeleteProduct/index.js"
   }
   ```

## Start the project

1. Start the Azure Functions project by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd>.

1. Notices that the URL's for your function endpoints are now different.

   ![VS Code terminal showing endpoints running on new routes](../media/restful-endpoints.png)

Look at that stunning API. It's simply gorgeous. Notice how you specified the same exact same route for the CreateProduct, UpdateProduct and DeleteProduct functions? Only the HTTP request method is different. You've turned three URL's into one while still having three endpoints. You're a magician. That's the power of REST.

Now it's time to connect these functions to the Cosmos DB database. Roll up your sleeves, because here comes the code. This is going to be fun.
