You're working on an API that connects to a database. Your API connects to that database via a database connection string. In this module, you'll learn best practices for storing sensitive information like connection strings in an Azure Functions API.

## Store connection strings in Azure Functions

It's a good idea to avoid hard-coding connection strings. You'll likely use the connection string across different files, and there's a chance that it could change in the future.

You'll want to store the connection string as an app setting. App settings are specified in one place and referenced throughout the app. They can be easily changed at any point in the future without having to change the code. App settings are never checked in to source control.

An Azure Functions project has a `local.settings.json` file. This file contains a set of key/value pairs that are used in the app as configuration values. You can add your own items to the "values" object. You'll be able to access those values from your code.

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node"
  }
}
```

If you wanted to add a connection string, you could do that by adding another property called "CONNECTION_STRING" (or whatever you would like to call it) and then passing the connection string to your database.

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "CONNECTION_STRING": "AccountEndpoint=https://tailwind-traders-7983.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=DQRvPibrRolFNVoVjyV8s4kBHr3jlixSBTVVJuwCMxG7NSeBmaftVuaXQ3Hi5h4Dw1AQXB0x1jdIqqBw1ZYzUQ==;"
  }
}
```

## Accessing app settings in Azure Functions code

To access these configuration values in your Azure Functions from JavaScript, see the `process.env` object. It will contain all of the key value pairs that are specified in the `local.settings.json` file.

```typescript
let client = new CosmosClient(process.env.CONNECTION_STRING);
```

You now know how to securely store a connection string, and how to reference that string in your application. In the next section, you'll add the database connection to your Azure Functions app and light up your API so it works.
