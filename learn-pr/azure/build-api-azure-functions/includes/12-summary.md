Thanks to you, the Tailwind Traders Product Manager application is finished! The project was a massive success, and Tailwind Traders doubled, no... they TRIPPLED their sales during the next holiday season thanks to their ability to quickly update their product inventory. There's a huge fake bonus coming your way. Don't spend it all in one place.

You've done so well to get through this module. You've learned about how to read and write data to Cosmos DB, what REST is and how to design API's with it, how to leverage CORS to protect your API, how to further secure your API with function keys and you did it all from VS Code.

Take a break, and then come back. There are many more Learn Modules waiting for you, and endless amazing things to build.
