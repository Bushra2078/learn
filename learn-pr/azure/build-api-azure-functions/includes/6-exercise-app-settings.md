It's time to put some gasoline in this API engine and fire it up. That's an analogy for connecting the function endpoints to the database. You're probably better at coding than we are with analogies.

## Get the database connection string

1. Paste the following code into the Sandbox on the right and press enter.

   ```bash
   cd mslearn-build-api-azure-functions/DB_SETUP && ./CREATE_DATABASE.sh
   ```

1. Copy the database connection string that is returned in the terminal.

## Add connection string to local settings

1. Open the `local.settings.json` file.

1. In the "Values" section, add a setting for "CONNECTION_STRING", and paste in the value you copied in the previous section.

   ```json
   {
     "IsEncrypted": false,
     "Values": {
       "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
       "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
       "CONNECTION_STRING": "PASTE YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE"
     }
   }
   ```

## Examine the productsService for the connection string

1.  Open the "api/services/productsService.ts" file.

1.  Look at line 3. Notice that the connection string is read from the `process.env` variable.

    ```typescript
    const CONNECTION_STRING = process.env.CONNECTION_STRING;
    ```

## Test out the GetProducts endpoint from Visual Studio Code

1. To start the project, press F5.

1. Navigate to the "/api/GetProducts" URL.

   ```http
   http://localhost:7071/api/GetProducts
   ```

1. Behold the products.
