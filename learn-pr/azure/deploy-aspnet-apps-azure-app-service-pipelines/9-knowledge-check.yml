  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  
  - content: "What is one of the primary benefits of using YAML-based authoring of Azure Pipelines compared with the classic approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "Version control functionality"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Because the pipeline is part of your code, you benefit from the version control functionality, allowing you to track pipeline changes and simplify identifying potential issues related to these changes."
    - content: "The support of visual designer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The visual designer is available with the classic approach."
    - content: "Separation between the build and deployment pipelines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The separation between the build and deployment pipelines is available with the classic approach."
  - content: "Which element of Azure Pipelines allows you to specify the operating system and software to be available on the host that will be executing the pipeline steps?"
    choices:
    - content: "stage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A stage can consist of multiple jobs. Each job can run on a different host."
    - content: "task"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A task doesn't support specifying the host to be used for its execution. This is configurable on the job level."
    - content: "job"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A job is a series of tasks that execute sequentially on the same underlying host. Azure Pipelines identifies the appropriate operating system and software to be included on this host based on the job's setting that you specify."
  - content: "Which method can you use to provision Azure resources in an Azure Pipeline in the imperative manner?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Resource Manager templates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Resource Manager templates support declarative deployment of Azure resources."
    - content: "Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure CLI supports imperative deployment of Azure resources."
    - content: "Terraform"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Terraform supports declarative deployment of Azure resources."
