Your organization recently began integrating its identities with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Your security team wants improved security reporting and monitoring to help reduce incidents. 

Your role is to demonstrate to the team the reporting capabilities of Azure AD, to ensure that proper monitoring is in place and the team is alerted about security events.

By using sign-in and activity logs, Azure Monitor can provide alerts about unusual or unexpected user behaviors. With Azure Monitor, you can build custom dashboards that display metrics and essential data about user activity and security across Azure AD.

Without Azure Monitor alerts and its single, at-a-glance, dashboard view of your team's Azure AD estate, the team might have no warning about unexpected incidents until it is too late. 

In this module, you've learned to build that dashboard view and help prevent and alert about such unexpected incidents.
