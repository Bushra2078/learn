Your organization recently began integrating its identities with Azure Active Directory. Your security team wants improved security reporting and monitoring to help reduce incidents. 

Your role is to demonstrate to the team the reporting capabilities of Azure Active Directory, to ensure that proper monitoring is in place and the team is alerted when security events occur.

By using sign-in and activity logs, Azure Monitor can provide alerts about unusual or unexpected user behavior. With Azure Monitor and a Log Analytics workspace, you can build custom dashboards that display metrics and essential data about user activity and security in Azure Active Directory.

Without alerts and a single, at-a-glance, dashboard view of your team's Azure Active Directory estate, the team might have no warning about unexpected incidents until it's too late.

In this module, you've learned how to build that dashboard view. You helped prevent data loss by creating alerts for unexpected incidents.
