Your organization recently began integrating their identities with Azure AD. Your security team wanted improved security reporting and monitoring to reduce incidents. You needed to demonstrate the reporting capabilities in Azure AD, to ensure that proper monitoring is in place to alert on security events.

By using the sign-in and activity logs, Azure Monitor alerts you to unusual or unexpected behaviors. With Azure Monitor, you create bespoke dashboards with metrics and essential data regarding user activity and security across your Azure Active Directory.

Without Azure Monitor providing alerts and giving a single, at-a-glance view of your Azure AD estate, you'd have no visibility of an attack until it was too late. That's a situation your security team is keen to avoid.
