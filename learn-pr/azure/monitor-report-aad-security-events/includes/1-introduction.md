Managing the security of your organization's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) instance and its associated resources and data is a perpetual battle. Sometimes, the discovery of a breach might occur hours or even days after the event. Microsoft Azure provides enhanced monitoring across your network. Your organization can use Azure to rapidly respond to suspicious user behavior, help prevent unauthorized access to your resources, and help prevent the potential loss of data.

Imagine that you work for an organization that recently has begun to integrate its user identities with Azure AD. The organization's security team wants to ensure that proper reporting and monitoring are in place. A recent incident with compromised identities led to exposed customer data. You need to demonstrate the reporting and monitoring capabilities of Azure AD and show how Azure AD can alert your organization to perceived security events.

In this module, you'll learn how to set up Azure Monitor to process your Azure AD activity and sign-in logs. You'll use Azure Monitor to set up security event alerts. Then, you'll see how to create a dashboard that helps improve your ability to respond to incidents.
