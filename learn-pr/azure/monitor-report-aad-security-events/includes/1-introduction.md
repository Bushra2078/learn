Managing the security of your organization's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and its associated resources and data is a perpetual battle. Sometimes, the discovery of a breach can occur hours or even days after the event.  Microsoft Azure gives enhanced monitoring across your network. Azure enables your organization to respond rapidly to any suspicious behavior, preventing access to your resources and loss of data.

Imagine you work for an organization that's recently begun integrating their identities with Azure AD. Your security team wants to ensure that proper reporting and monitoring are in place. A recent incident with compromised identities led to exposed customer data. You need to demonstrate the reporting and monitoring capabilities in Azure AD, and how that can alert on perceived security events.

In this module, you'll learn how to set up Azure Monitor to process your activity and sign-in logs. Using Azure Monitor, you'll set up security event alerts.  Finally, you'll see how to create a dashboard that helps improve your ability to respond to incidents.

- Store Azure audit activity and sign-in activity logs in Azure Monitor.
