Managing the security of your organization's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and its associated resources and data is a perpetual battle. Sometimes, the discovery of a breach can occur hours or even days after the event.  Microsoft Azure provides enhanced monitoring across your network. It enables your organization to respond rapidly to suspicious user behavior, and help prevent unauthorized access to your resources and potential loss of data.

Imagine that you work for an organization that has recently begun integrating its identities with Azure AD. Your security team wants to ensure that proper reporting and monitoring are in place. A recent incident with compromised identities led to exposed customer data. You need to demonstrate the reporting and monitoring capabilities in Azure AD, and show how it can alert your organization to perceived security events.

In this module, you'll learn how to set up Azure Monitor to process your activity and sign-in logs. By using Azure Monitor, you'll set up security event alerts. Then, you'll see how to create a dashboard that helps improve your ability to respond to incidents.
