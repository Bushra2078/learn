## Role(s)

- Solution Architect

## Level

- Intermediate

## Product(s)

- Azure AD
- Azure Monitor

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Azure AD
- Basic familiarity with Azure Monitor

## Summary

Keep tabs on security events in your Azure AD resources by using built-in reporting and monitoring capabilities. Respond to events as they happen and address security risks before they become a problem.

## Learning objectives

1. *Add numbered Learning Objectives [(Learning objective guidance)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-learning-objectives)*

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Monitor and report on security events in Azure AD*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You work for an organization that has recently begun integrating their identities with Azure AD. Your security team would like to ensure that proper security reporting and monitoring are in place, as a recent incident with compromised identities led to exposed customer data. You need to demonstrate the reporting capabilities in Azure AD, and ensure that proper monitoring is in place to alert on security events.

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

## Notes

Look at structuring the module based on the sections in the following doc. Consider creating a new tenant and going through the logging and monitoring configuration steps as hands-on activities. If we can generate some activity to populate queries and reports, great, but that may take extended time.
