# Module Design

## Title

Choose a compute provisioning solution for your application

## Role(s)

- Solution architect

## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Resource manager templates
- VM extensions (custom script and DSC extensions)
- Azure Automation State Configuration
- Discussion of third-party tools (Chef, Terraform, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure virtual machines
- Basic knowledge of PowerShell

## Summary

Discover the services and tools available to automate the deployment and configuration of your Azure infrastructure.

## Learning objectives

1. Identify the solutions available to provision compute on Azure
2. Choose an appropriate provisioning platform based on your requirements

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Choose a compute provisioning solution for your application*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- |---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    An organization is moving several applications to Azure that run on virtual machines. They need to build out a number of virtual machines now and in the future and would like to move from a manual process that can be time consuming and error prone, to an automated process to improve operational abilities. They are unsure of what tools are available on Azure to provision compute, and where each fit in to the overall provisioning process. 

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type
    
 1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    1. Step
    1. Step

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?
