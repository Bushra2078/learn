## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Choose a compute provisioning solution for your application*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- |---|---|---|---|

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    An organization is moving several applications to Azure that run on virtual machines. They need to build out a number of virtual machines now and in the future and would like to move from a manual process that can be time consuming and error prone, to an automated process to improve operational abilities. They are unsure of what tools are available on Azure to provision compute, and where each fit in to the overall provisioning process.

## Title

Build a scalable application with virtual machine scale sets

## Role(s)

- Solution architect

## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Azure virtual machine scale sets

1. **Introduction**

    A domestic shipping company has a web site that customers can use to manage and check the status of their shipments. This site currently runs on virtual machines on-premises, and the company is moving this application to Azure. They currently have a fixed capacity on-premises, and are unable to adjust to fluctuations in load without manually intervening and creating or deallocating virtual machines. They need a solution that will automatically handle these fluctuations in load to ensure consistent performance for their web site. They also need a way to easily roll out application updates to the servers while minimizing impact to end users.
