In this module we looked at native Azure solutions, such as the VM extensions (custom script and DSC extensions) and their purposes.  We have also looked at non-native Azure solutions for provisioning and configuration. We have learned how they can help us automate manual processes and post deployment tasks. The primary goal for automation is to be able to deploy and operate infrastructure and services in Azure in an easy, robust, and repeatable manner. We identified the tools available to do automation. We have learned how to decide between which provisioning tools to use for specific scenarios. Each tool has its own advantages and disadvantages, and some tools can and should be used together.
