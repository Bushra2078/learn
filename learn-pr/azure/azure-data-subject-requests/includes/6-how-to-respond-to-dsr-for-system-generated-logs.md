Because the definition of "personal data" can be interpreted broadly, logs generated by Microsoft could contain data that is deemed personal. System-generated logs are an intracal part of the service provided in the Microsoft cloud. As such, it is not possible to restrict or rectify data in these logs. Doing so could expose the Microsoft cloud to fraud and other security risks. System-generated logs are also an historical record and any modification would compromise the integrity of that record.  

## Scenarios for DSR in Azure and Office 365 for system-generated logs

Microsoft supports the following DSR requests for system-generated logs:

- Access Request
- Delete Request
- Export Request

Example 1: DSR for system-generated logs in Azure

A customer of Contoso, Ltd that resides in Spain has submitted a DSR form in the corporate website to see the thier personal data stored in system-generated logs. To execute the DSR you perform the following tasks:

Export
1. Notify the account administrator of the request for system-generated logs.
2. Account administrator uses the Azure portal to create an export request.
    * Open Azure portal
    * Select All services and then select Policy
    * In the Policy blade, choose User privacy, choose Manage User Requests, and then select Add export request
    *  On the **New export data requst** form, provide the following details and then select **Create**
        - User
        - Subscription
        - Storage account
        - Container
3. Account administrator exports the data and send the data subet the file.

> **Note:** Because personal data can come from multiple systems, it's possible that the export process might take up to one month to complete.
