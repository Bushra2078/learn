The definition of *personal data* is open to broad interpretation, and the logs that Microsoft generates could contain data that is deemed personal. System-generated logs are an integral part of the service provided in Microsoft cloud products. As such, you cannot restrict or rectify data in these logs. <!--Richard, I deleted these two sentences that were already in another unit. -->Only the tenant administrator can administer DSRs for system-generated logs for an enterprise customer.

## Scenarios for DSR in Azure and Office 365 for system-generated logs

Microsoft supports the following DSRs for system-generated logs:

- Access request
- Delete request
- Export request

Data that could be derived from system-generated logs includes:

- Product and service usage data (user activity logs)
- User search requests and query data
- Data generated by product and services when a user interacts with system functionality

### Example one: DSR for system-generated logs in Azure

A customer of Contoso that resides in Spain has submitted a DSR form on the corporate website to review their personal data stored in system-generated logs. To fulfill the DSR, you’ll perform the following tasks:

1. Notify the tenant administrator of the request for system-generated logs.
2. The tenant administrator will use the Azure portal to create an export request:

    - Open the Azure portal,
    - Select **All services** and then select **Policy**
    - In the **Policy blade**, choose **User privacy**, choose **Manage User Requests**, and then select **Add export request**
    - On the **New export data request** form, provide the following details, and then select **Create**:
      - User
      - Subscription
      - Storage account
      - Container

3. Tenant administrator exports the data and sends the file to the data subject.

> [!NOTE]
> Personal data can come from multiple systems, so the export process might take up to one month to complete.

### Example two: DSR for system-generated logs in Office 365 and Microsoft 365

A customer of Contoso that resides in the Netherlands has submitted a DSR form on the corporate website to delete their personal data stored in system-generated logs. To execute the DSR, you’ll perform the following tasks:

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to Azure AD and select **Users**.

    - In the **All users** blade, select the check box next to the data subject's user account.
    - Select **Delete user** and then select **Yes** to confirm. 
    - In the **Deleted users** blade, select the check box next to the data subject's user account.
    - Select **Delete permanently** and then select **Yes** to confirm.

> [!NOTE]
> In example two, you used the same process that you used to fulfill the delete requests for personal data in Azure. The user’s personal data in the system-generated logs will be deleted, along with the user account, as long as it doesn’t negatively impact the security or integrity of the Microsoft cloud products. This usually happens within 30 days of the user account deletion.

> [!NOTE]
> The exception to the 30-day period is the user's mailbox in Exchange Online. To prevent accidental data loss, Exchange Online places data in a holding state for up to 60 days after permanent deletion of a user account. You’ll need to contact Microsoft Support if the mailbox data must be removed outside the automated delete timeline. 

### National clouds

In the event that Contoso were to have a global presence in one or more national clouds, their tenant admin will need to perform the following steps to fulfill an export request for system-generated logs.

|National Cloud|Export Steps|
|---|---|
|Office 365 Germany|Same steps previously described<!--Richard, if not too long, could you add the steps here again for easier access?-->|
|Office 365 US Government|Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center and submit a request to Microsoft Support|
|Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China)|Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center operated by 21Vianet admin portal. Select **Commerce**, select **Subscription**, select **Privacy**, select **GDPR**, and then enter the required information.|
