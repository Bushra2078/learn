The definition of personal data can be broadly interpreted. As such, Microsoft-generated logs could contain data that's deemed personal. System-generated logs are an integral part of the service provided in Microsoft cloud products. However, you can't restrict or rectify data in these logs as that would compromise the integrity of the logs. Instead, only the tenant administrator can administer DSRs for system-generated logs for an enterprise customer.

## Scenarios for DSR in Azure and Office 365 for system-generated logs

Microsoft supports the following DSRs for system-generated logs:

- Access request
- Delete request
- Export request

Data that could be derived from system-generated logs includes:

- Product and service usage data (user activity logs)
- User search requests and query data
- Data generated by products and services when a user interacts with system functionality

### Example 1: DSR for system-generated logs in Azure

A Contoso customer residing in Spain submitted a DSR form via the corporate website. They are requesting their personal data that's stored in system-generated logs. To fulfill the DSR, you can use the following steps:

1. Notify the tenant administrator of the request for system-generated logs.
2. The tenant administrator can then use the Azure portal to create an export request with the following steps:

    1. Open the Azure portal.
    1. Select **All services**, and then select **Policy**.
    1. In the **Policy blade**, select **User privacy**, select **Manage User Requests**, and then select **Add export request**.
    1. On the **New export data request** form, provide the following details, and then select **Create**:

      - User
      - Subscription
      - Storage account
      - Container

3. The tenant administrator can then export the data, and then send the file to the data subject.

> [!NOTE]
> Personal data can come from multiple systems. This could be one reason the export process can take up to a month to complete.

### Example 2: DSR for system-generated logs in Office 365 and Microsoft 365

One of Contoso's customers who resides in the Netherlands has submitted a DSR form through the corporate website. They are requesting to delete their personal data stored in system-generated logs. To fulfill the DSR, you can perform the following tasks:

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
1. Navigate to Azure AD, and then select **Users**.
1. In the **All users** blade, select the data subject's user account check box.
1. Select **Delete user**, and then select **Yes** to confirm.
1. In the **Deleted users** blade, select the data subject's user account check box.
1. Select **Delete permanently**, and then select **Yes** to confirm.

> [!NOTE]
> In example 2, you used the same process that you used to fulfill the delete requests for personal data in Azure. The user’s personal data in the system-generated logs will be deleted, along with the user account, providing it doesn’t negatively impact the security or integrity of any of the Microsoft cloud products. This usually happens within 30 days of the user account deletion.

> [!NOTE]
> The exception to the 30-day period is the user's mailbox in Exchange Online. To prevent accidental data loss, Exchange Online places data in a holding state for up to 60 days after permanent deletion of a user account. You’ll need to contact Microsoft Support if the mailbox data must be removed outside the automated delete timeline.

### National clouds

If Contoso had a global presence in one or more national clouds and someone made a DSR export request for system-generated logs, their tenant admin can complete the following steps.

|National cloud|Export steps|
|---|---|
|Office 365 Germany|Same process as Office 365 cloud.|
|Office 365 US Government|Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to submit a request to Microsoft Support|
|Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China)|Access the Microsoft 365 admin center operated by 21Vianet admin portal. Select **Commerce**, select **Subscription**, select **Privacy**, select **GDPR**, and then enter the required information.|
