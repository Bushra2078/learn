Because the definition of "personal data" can be interpreted broadly, logs generated by Microsoft could contain data that is deemed personal. System-generated logs are an intracal part of the service provided in the Microsoft cloud. As such, it is not possible to restrict or rectify data in these logs. Doing so could expose the Microsoft cloud to fraud and other security risks. System-generated logs are also an historical record and any modification would compromise the integrity of that record. The tenant administrator is the only one that can administer DSRs for system-generated logs for an enterprise customer.

## Scenarios for DSR in Azure and Office 365 for system-generated logs

Microsoft supports the following DSR requests for system-generated logs:

- Access Request
- Delete Request
- Export Request

Data that could be derived from system-generated logs includes:
- Product and service usage data (user activity logs)
- User search requests and query data
- Data generated by product and services when a user interacts with system functionality

Example 1: DSR for system-generated logs in Azure

A customer of Contoso, Ltd that resides in Spain has submitted a DSR form in the corporate website to see the thier personal data stored in system-generated logs. To execute the DSR you perform the following tasks:

**Export**
1. Notify the Tenant administrator of the request for system-generated logs.
2. Tenant administrator uses the Azure portal to create an export request.
    * Open Azure portal
    * Select **All services** and then select **Policy**
    * In the Policy blade, choose **User privacy**, choose **Manage User Requests**, and then select **Add export request**
    *  On the **New export data requst** form, provide the following details and then select **Create**
        - User
        - Subscription
        - Storage account
        - Container
3. Tenant administrator exports the data and send the data subject the file.

> **Note:** Because personal data can come from multiple systems, it's possible that the export process might take up to one month to complete.

Example 2: DSR for system-generated logs in Office 365 / Microsoft 365

A customer of Contoso, Ltd that resides in the Netherlands has submitted a DSR form in the corporate website to delete their personal data stored in system-generated logs. To execute the DSR you perform the following tasks:

**Delete**
1. Sign into the Azure portal
2. Navigate to Azure Active Directory and select **Users**
    * In the **All users** blade, select the check-box next to the data subject's user account.
    * Select **Delete user** and then select **Yes** to confirm. 
    * In the **Deleted users** blade, select the check-box next to the data subject's user account.
    * Select **Delete permanently** and then select **Yes** to confirm.

You may have noticed, in example 2, that the same process was used to satisfy the delete requests for personal data in Azure. The system-generated logs that contain the data subject's personal data will be deleted, along with the user, as long as it does not negativly impact the security or integrity the Microsoft cloud.

## Tools used for DSR for system-generated logs

The following table lists tool that can be used for executing DSRs for system-generated logs in the Microsoft Cloud.

|Tool Name|Description|
