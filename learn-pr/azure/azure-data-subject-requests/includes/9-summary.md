In this module, you've learned about Data Subject Requests (DSR) and the process of responding to DSRs. Specifically, youâ€™ve learned about responses to customer data requests and system-generated log requests in both Azure and Microsoft 365/Office 365. You reviewed Microsoft products and services that may be the focus of a DSR based on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) definitions of personal data.  You have learned how to respond to a DSR in various scenarios using tools available to execute the DSRs in the Microsoft cloud. You have successfully responded to a DSR in a test environment. You now have enough information to present to the legal department and alleviate their concerns.
