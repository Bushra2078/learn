Like the Azure DSR response, the Office 365 DSR response has a scope to it. Office 365 services are availabe in different envionments that can impact the scope. For example, a DSR received by an Office 365 customer in Germany would be executed in a national cloud called Office 365 Germany. Another similatrity between Azure and Office 365 DSR response is that the process of responing is broken into parts for ease of exection. 

## Scope of DSR for Office 365 applications
In general, the actions perfomed when executing a DSR for Office 365 applications will be the same regardless of the envionement. However, there are some exceptions based on isolated clouds and cross-premises scenarios. 

**Office 365 National Clouds**

National clouds are isolated from the Office 365 cloud and may have notible diferences in the DSR exectuion processes. The following are national clouds:
- Office 365 Germany
- Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China)
- Office 365 US Government

**Hybrid deployments**

Many oganizaitons choose to manage their user identities in on-premises deployments of Active Directory. Hybrid deployments combine cloud-based servcies and on-premiess server products. In a hybrid deployments an organzation can share accounts and resources. For example, a user can sign in with their on-premises user account and access their mailbox in the cloud. Some of the most common hybrid deployments include:

- Exchange hybrid deployments, where some users have an on-premises mailbox and other users have Exchange Online mailboxes.
- SharePoint hybrid deployments, where site and file servers are on-premises and OneDrive for Business accounts are in Office 365
- The on-premises identity management system (Active Directory) that is synchronized with Azure Activity Directory, which is the underlying directory service in Office 365.

In a hybrid deployment the scope will vary based on the data that is responsive to a specific data subjet's DSR. It will be up to the controller to determin if the response must come from the cloud or from on-premises. While this module focuses on the cloud-based data responses, there is additional guidance available for responsding to DSRs on-premises. See "GDPR for Office on-premises Servers" https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-for-office-servers 

**In-scope Applications**

Office 365 encompases many applications that have the potential to store user data. Knowing which applicaitons that the data subject uses will help narrow down what is in-scope for the DRS response. Depending on the applicaiton, you may be able to use the Content Search tool to respond. In some caseses however, you'll have to use the in-app functionality to get to the data.


One of the fastest ways to determine the in-scope applications is to review the Microsoft 365 for business subcription. The Office 365 admin portal can be used to locate the user's account. In the properites for the user account you can view thier product licensing. 


## DSR response processes for Office 365 applications

The guidance for executing a DSR in Office 365 ("Office 365 Data Subject Requests for the GDPR and CCPA" https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-dsr-office365 ) is broken iinto four parts. The high-level exectuion tasks differ based on the data type,  application, and the request type. Parts 1-3 detail the technical capabilities available to an organization to respond to a DSR request. In some limited scenarios, however, Microsoft will be the data controller when people use certain Office 365 products and services. Part 4 provides guidance on how data subjects can submit DSR requests to Microsoft.


**Part 1: Responding to DSRs for Customer Data**

1. Using the Content Search eDiscovery tool to respond to DSRs
2. Using In-App functionality to respond to DSRs
3. Responding to DSR rectification requests
4. Responding to DSR restriction requests

The following table shows the applications that support Content Search in Office 365.

App Name|App Name|App Name|App Name
---|---|---|---
Calendar|Excel|Office Lens|OneDrive for Business
OneNote|Outlook/Exchange|People|PowerPoint

**Part 2: Responding to DSRs with Respect to Insights Generated by Office 365**

The Microsoft suite of Office 365 services includes online services that provide insights to users and organizations that have opted to use them.

-Delve and MyAnalytics provide insights to individual users
-Workplace Analytics provides insights to organizations.

1. Access and export
2. Rectify
3. Restrict
4. Delete

**Part 3: Responding to DSRs for system-generated Logs**

The ability to restrict or rectify data in system-generated logs is not supported. Data in system-generated logs constitutes factual actions conducted within the Microsoft cloud and diagnostic data, and modifications to such data would compromise the historical record of actions and increase fraud and security risks.
1. Accessing and exporting system-generated logs
2. Notify about exporting or deleting issues
3. Deleting system-generated logs

**National Clouds**
A global IT admin needs to do the following to export system-generated log data in the following national clouds:
- Office 365 Germany: Follow the steps above.
- Office 365 US Government: Go to the Office 365 admin portal and submit a request to Microsoft Support.
- Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China): Go to the Office 365 operated by 21Vianet admin portal and then go to **Commerce > Subscription > Privacy > GDPR** and enter the required information.
