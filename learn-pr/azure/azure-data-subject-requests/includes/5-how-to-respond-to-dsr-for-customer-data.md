Once a data controller receives a DSR, a repsone must be given as soon as possible. GDPR requires that a response is given in one calandar month. For example, if the request is recieved on January 1st, the response is required by February 1st. CCPA requires a response no later than 45 days. Failure to comply in the specified periods could incur severe monitary penalties. In order to respond efficiently to a DSR for customer data, organizations can follow the guidance from Microsoft and use the tools and in-app features avaialble in Office 365.
