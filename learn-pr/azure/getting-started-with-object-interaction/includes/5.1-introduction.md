## Introduction

The key to the success of the application lies in its user interface. It is the first layer of the encounter between your application and the user; creating a good impact through the user interface will help outreach your application. In this module

## Example scenario

Suppose say you are working at a tech company in the UI/UX designing team. Your company is planning to launch a holographic application. Your job is to improve the application's user experience by providing components that will assist the user in better interaction with the holograms.

## What will we be doing?

This module shows you how to build a mixed reality user experience with MRTK using NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover hologram model. Here, you'll: 
* Create a simple user interface using MRTK's button and menu prefabs.
* Add dynamic tooltip UI elements.
* Add bounds control around 3D objects

By the end of the module, you can add UI elements to your project using MRTK.
