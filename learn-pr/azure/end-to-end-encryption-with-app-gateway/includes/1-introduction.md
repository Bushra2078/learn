Transport encryption helps to protect the application data while in transit from the user to your servers. This means that no unauthorized user can see the data.

Consider the example of a retail organization that has a new shipping portal. The organization is publishing this portal to allow vendors to ship customer items and track status. This portal exposes business and customer data. The data needs to be encrypted between the user and the back-end application to ensure this data is not captured by an unauthorized user while it's transmitted over the network. The organization has implemented Application Gateway to load balance traffic. The organization now needs to enable TLS encryption between the user and their servers.

This module shows you how to encrypt traffic with TLS using the Application Gateway.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Implement TLS encryption between your end users and Application Gateway
- Implement TLS encryption between Application Gateway and your web server

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of SSL/TLS encryption
- Basic knowledge of PowerShell
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts
