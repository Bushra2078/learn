Transport encryption secures the data of your application while in transit from the user to your servers, this means that nobody can see the data being sent by your users.

A retail organization has a new shipping portal they are publishing to allow vendors to ship customer items and track status. This exposes business and customer data, and needs to be encrypted between the user and the back end application to ensure this data is not exposed while transmitted over the network. They have implemented Application Gateway to load balance their traffic, and need to enable TLS encryption between the user and their servers.

This module shows you how to encrypt all of the traffic with TLS using the Application Gateway.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Implement TLS encryption between your end users and Application Gateway
- Implement TLS encryption between Application Gateway and your web server

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of SSL/TLS encryption
- Basic knowledge of PowerShell
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts
