When we choose to develop our function project locally, we're not running an emulator. The tools made available by Microsoft include the same components that also power the Functions infrastructure in Azure.

The easiest way to leverage these tools is through Visual Studio Code, which you can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

By installing the required extensions and services, you can get a fully-fledged functions development environment.

## Objective

Install and configure the tooling required to develop and execute Functions locally without cloud dependencies.

## Required components for the functions project

> [!TIP]
> If you want to verify your installation, you're invited to clone our [repository located on GitHub at https://aka.ms/learn-live-foundations-serverless-dev-repo](https://aka.ms/learn-live-foundations-serverless-dev-repo) and build both the included (completed) functions project and the Angular-based client.
>
> Note that we will be building the functions project from scratch during this course, but we'll be using the completed Angular client to execute calls against the functions.

Unfortunately, there is no single-package download that would install all the required components on your system.

Start by downloading Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

### Install Node.js

You can write functions with various programming languages. We are using TypeScript in this series, which requires Node.js.

Follow the download and installation instructions for your platform at [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org).

### Add "Azure Functions Extension for VS Code"

Visual Studio Code's extensions offer support for local Azure functions development.

Find details about the extension at [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) and add it to your VScode installation.

### Install Azure Functions Core Tools

Azure Functions Core Tools lets you develop and test your functions on your local computer from the command prompt or terminal.

The installation instructions are platform-specific. Follow the instructions for your platform at  [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local](/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?WT.mc_id=learnlive-video-learn)

### Components required to run the client app

Our project contains server-related components and a client app built with Angular. You're not making any changes to this client, but additional components are required to build and run it successfully.

### Angular CLI

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a framework to create single-page-applications (SPA) using TypeScript.

You can find detailed installation instructions at [angular.io/guide/setup-local](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

The short version of the instructions is straightforward: run the following command in your terminal:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Optional: Debugger support

If you are planning to dive a bit deeper and explore Angular, debugging support in Visual Studio Code is handy. There are extensions for different browsers.

### Optional: Angular language services extension

There are many extensions for Visual Studio Code that make Angular development easier. We found this one particularly useful:
