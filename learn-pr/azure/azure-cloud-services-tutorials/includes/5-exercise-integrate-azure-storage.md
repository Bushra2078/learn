In this module, you'll learn how to save entity data to Azure Table storage and thumbnail images to Azure Blob storage. This feature will allow us to store and retrieve *Tracked Objects* with data like ID, Name, Thumbnail Image, and more across sessions and devices to the cloud.

## Understand Azure Storage

**Azure storage** is a Microsoft storage solution on the cloud that can cover many scenarios and requirements. It can scale massively and is easily approachable by developers. All services can be consumed under the umbrella of an **Azure storage Account**. For our use case, we'll use *Table storage* and *Blob storage*.

Learn more about [Azure storage services](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview).

### Azure Table Storage

This service allows us to store data in a NoSQL fashion. In our project, we'll use it to store information about the *Tracked Object*, such as name, description, spatial anchor ID, and more.

In context of the demo application, you'll need two Tables; one to store information about the project with information about the state of trained models more about that in the (Integrating Azure Custom Vision) tutorial, and a second table to store information about *Tracked Objects*.

Learn more about [Azure Table storage](/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview).

### Azure Blob Storage

This service allows you to store large binary files. You'll use Azure Blob Storage to store photos taken for *Tracked Objects* as thumbnails.

For the purposes of the demo application, you need one Blob Container in which to store the images.

Learn more about [Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction).

## Prepare Azure Storage

To use the Azure storage services, you'll need an Azure storage account. To create a storage account, see [Create a storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create). To learn more about storage accounts, see [Azure storage account overview](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

Once you have a storage account, you can retrieve the connection string from the **Azure portal**. It can be found under Security + networking > Access keys. You'll need the connection string in the next section of this lesson.

### Optional Azure Storage Explorer

While you can view and verify all data changes from the UI inside the application, we recommend installing [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/). This tool allows you to visualize the data in  Azure storage, and is of great help when debugging and learning.

> [!TIP]
> For testing from inside the Unity editor, you can use a local emulator:
>
> * on Windows 10, you can use [Azure Storage Emulator](/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite)
> * on MacOS or Linux, you can use [Azurite Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-storage-azurite) for Docker

## Prepare the scene

1. In the Hierarchy window, locate the **DataManager** object and select it.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/data-manager-configure.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Unity with DataManager script component configuration fields shown in Inspector." lightbox="../media/data-manager-configure.png":::

    The **DataManager (script)** component in the Inspector window contains all **Azure storage** related settings. All relevant settings are already set; you just need to replace the *Connection String* field with the one you retrieved from the Azure portal. If you're using a local Azure storage emulator solution, then you can keep the already provided *Connection String* or it can be left empty.

    The **DataManager (script)** is responsible for talking to the **Table storage** and **Blob storage** which is consumed by other controller scripts on the UI components.

## Write and read data from Azure Table Storage

> [!Note]
> Building and testing on HoloLens 2 is not mandatory. You can test on the [HoloLens 2 Emulator](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/advanced-concepts/using-the-hololens-emulator) if you don't have a HoloLens device. You can purchase devices at [HoloLens.com](https://hololens.com/).

With everything prepared, it's time to create a *Tracked Object*.

1. Open the application on your HoloLens, then select the **Set Object**. The *EnterObjectName* object will become active in the hierarchy. Select the *search bar* and type in the name you wish to give the *Tracked Object*. After providing a name, select  the **Set object** button. This will create the *Tracked Object* on the Azure Table storage. The **Object Card** will display.

    This **Object Card** is a UI representation of the *Tracked Object* and will have an important role in this tutorial series.

2. Now select the description *text box* and type in *Car*, then select the **Save** button to save the changes. Stop the application and rerun it.

3. Select **Search Object** and type the name you entered previously when creating the *Tracked Object* into the Search bar. You'll see that the **Object Card** with all data retrieved from the **Azure Table storage**.

4. Feel free to close the **Object Card**, create new *Tracked Objects*, and edit their data.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you've installed the [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/), you can find your *Tracked Object* in the *Objects* table.

## Upload and download images from Azure Blob Storage

In this section, you'll use Azure Blob Storage to upload and download images to use as thumbnails for *Tracked Objects*.

> [!NOTE]
> In this tutorial, the application will take photos to upload images to Azure Blob Storage. If you're running this locally from the Unity editor, make sure you have a webcam connected to your computer.

1. Open the application on your HoloLens, select **Set Object**, and type *Car* into the Search bar. On the **Object Card**, select the **Camera** button. You'll be instructed to do an AirTap to take a photo. After taking a photo, you'll see a message that informs you about the active upload, and after a while the image should appear where the placeholder was before.

2. Now rerun the application and search for the *Tracked Object* and the previously uploaded image should appear as thumbnail.

## Delete images from Azure Blob Storage

In the previous section, you uploaded new images to Azure Blob Storage. In this section, you'll delete an image thumbnail for your *Tracked Objects*.

1. Open the application on your HoloLens, select **Set Object**, and type *Car* into the Search bar. On the **Object Card** with the thumbnail image, select the **Delete** button. The thumbnail image is replaced by the placeholder image.

2. Now rerun the application and search for the *Tracked Object* of the previously deleted thumbnail. You should only see the placeholder image.
