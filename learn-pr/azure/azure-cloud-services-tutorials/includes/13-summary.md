Throughout the module series, you have learned about the features you will implement and how **Azure Cloud** services tie in to making your HoloLens 2 application. You added the required components into the project and prepared the scene for this module series. 

You can now store data and images in the cloud with **Azure Storage**, use **Azure Custom Vision** to associate images and train a model, bring objects to a local context with **Azure Spatial Anchors**, and implement **Azure Bot Framework powered by LUIS** to add a conversational bot for a new and natural interaction pattern.

## Next steps

Build an intelligent Bot application to automate any repetitive tasks in your day to day activities. Consider trying the following interactions:

* Learn about other Azure services and understand how to you use them in your project
* Use different types of storage provided by Azure
