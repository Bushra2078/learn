# Azure Cloud Services Tutorials

Azure Cloud Services is an example of a platform as a service (PaaS). Like Azure App Service, this technology is designed to support applications that are scalable, reliable, and inexpensive to operate. In the same way that App Service is hosted on virtual machines (VMs), so too is Azure Cloud Services. However, you have more control over the VMs. You can install your own software on VMs that use Azure Cloud Services, and you can access them remotely.

Suppose you are developing a Mixed Reality application that needs an enormous amount of resources from time to time. You plan to store these resources using the Azure Cloud services. Unfortunately, you have a minimal idea about how to implement azure cloud services in your application.

In this five-part module series, you will learn how to integrate several **Azure Cloud** services into a **Unity** project for **HoloLens 2**. With each consecutive chapter, you will add new **Azure Cloud** services to expand the application features and user experience, while teaching you the fundamentals of each **Azure Cloud** service.
