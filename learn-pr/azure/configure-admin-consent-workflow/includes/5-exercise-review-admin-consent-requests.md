When you select an application, you'll be able to approve, block, or deny the admin consent requests for the selected application.

## Act on pending requests

**Approve the application** - Select **Review permissions and consent** under details to review the applicationâ€™s permissions and grant admin consent. Granting admin consent to the application will add it to your tenant and all users will be able to access it unless you restrict access to the application. Only designated reviewers will be able to perform this action from the **My Pending** tab.

**Block the application** - The application will be added to your tenant with a disabled status. Users won't be able to use it or access it through their My Apps portal. Only designated reviewers will be able to perform this action from the **My Pending** tab, and only users with the permission to create service principals from the backing application can perform this action. The reviewer should provide a justification for blocking the application.

:::image type="content" source="../media/5-block-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to block application.":::

**Deny the admin consent request** - This action won't block or add the application to your tenant. The request will be ignored, but may return if another user requests access. Only designated reviewers will be able to perform this action from the **My Pending** tab. The request may still occur if a user makes a similar request. The reviewer should provide a justification for denying the application.

After the reviewer acts on the consent request, the requestor is notified of the status of their request via email.

If the reviewer approves the request, the users won't be required to consent to the application for the same permissions during their next sign-in.
