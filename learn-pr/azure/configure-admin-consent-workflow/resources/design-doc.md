## Level

intermediate

## Product(s)

- Azure active directory

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an [active subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- The Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or Application Administrator role.
- Ability to develop with JavaScript or TypeScript at the beginner level.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this module, the learner will be able to:

- Identify possible user and administrator consent configurations
- Configure the admin consent workflow to enable users to submit requests to access applications.
- Test the admin consent workflow feature by using test user accounts.
- Manage, evaluate, and act on admin consent requests

## Outline the units

1. Introduction

Suppose you work as an IT admin for a retail company that focuses on integrating applications for the employees in your organization. To be as secure as possible, you haven't allowed users to grant access to any applications in their tenant, which means only administrators can grant access to adding an application. Sometimes, your coworkers send you emails asking you to add applications they would like to use with their work accounts. Your email has been overwhelmed, and youâ€™re having to research the permissions and information about each application. You hear about the admin consent workflow, which can field and track requests in the Azure portal and give trusted and up to date information for each application.

1. Summary

As the IT administrator for your company, you restricted user access to applications by requiring each user to reach out to you in person when they need to be granted access. This user consent setting enabled you to keep the organization's resources secure from malicious applications, but it was difficult for you to keep up with the growing number of requests.

In this module, you implemented the admin consent workflow that enables the users to request for admin consent right from the consent screen. You were able to view all the incoming requests and their details from the Azure portal and respond to them in a timely and more organized manner.
