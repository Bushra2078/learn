Our goal was to show you how to evaluate whether you should consider blockchain technology when developing a solution. We developed some criteria you can use to guide your decision:

* How blockchain establishes trust between participants
* Performance considerations
* Business logic
* Azure options

Analyze your business process against each of these criteria. The results should give you an idea of how close a match blockchain is to your needs.
