Batch transcription is a part of Azure Speech serviceâ€™s Speech-to-text. This service allows you to transcribe large amounts of audio into text, quickly and accurately. Batch transcription can be configured with optional properties not available with real-time Speech-to-text, such as profanity filters and timestamps, along with standard services like speaker separation. 

Batch transcription is available in over 90 languages and dialects and can be used with Custom models to overcome speech recognition barriers such as background noise, accents, and industry-specific terminology
