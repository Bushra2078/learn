Batch Transcription can process WAV (PCM Codec), MP3 (PCM Codec), and OGG (Opus Codec) files sampled at 8kHz or 16kHz. These must be at a publicly accessible or shared access signature (SAS) URI.  It can process one or more files per batch. If more than one file is provided, the system attempts to process these in parallel, minimizing turn-around time.
