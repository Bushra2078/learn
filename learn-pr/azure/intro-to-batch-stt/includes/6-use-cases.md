While having your poor-quality audio data transcribed quickly and accurately is the main problem we’ve been trying to solve in our scenario, there is even more that we can do with the transcriptions to be able to better understand our customers and help our staff feel supported.

## Integrating for more business insights

You’ve found that Batch Transcription is the key to solving the problems your call center is facing, especially once you’ve added in customization. Yet, you recently found that can get even more from your audio data by integrating with other Azure services, such as Azure Cognitive Search for Knowledge Mining to find the patterns in your data that can lead to more positive outcomes for your staff and customers. Further, you’ve found that by integrating with Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI), you can better visualize this data to create deeper understanding of the data and make it easier to share with your company. Overall, resulting in your company getting the most information from the audio data.

## Beyond Call Centers

We’ve focussed quite heavily on our call-center scenario to illustrate key features of Batch Transcription. We’ve discussed how it can provide rapid and robust transcription of audio files and how it can be customized for specific languages and phrases. We’ve also discussed how the use of Batch Transcription can open a door to deeper AI-powered analyses that leverage audio data to improve business practices.

There are a variety of situations outside of our call-center scenario where Batch Transcription can provide real commercial or social benefit. Considering these scenarios, you may come up with other ideas on how you might integrate Batch Transcription into your applications.

## Increasing accessibility

Creating equitable environments that include everyone in the conversation is important, and batch transcriptions can help with that. For example, using batch transcription, you can create more inclusive media for people with hearing impairments through subtitles for videos, which is of great importance as hearing impairments are increasing around the world.

Further, teachers can increase accessibility, comprehension and retention in classrooms by recording their verbal lectures and having them transcribed after for students to read. Teachers can also introduce dictation for students with difficulties manually typing. Rather than writing a paper, students can enable punctuation and dictate their ideas, and use batch transcription to accurately transcribe, promoting independence and creativity.

## Meeting Compliance Standards

Many corporations and government agencies must meet compliance standards when interacting with customers, which is typically done by recording and monitoring phone calls. Yet, to meet the standard would require massive amounts of manual intervention and be prone to errors because of the difficult nature of transcribing telephone data. By using batch transcription companies and government bodies can have their calls transcribed at a faster rate because once the transcription starts, it is faster than real-time transcription.  Meaning meeting compliance standards becomes easier, resulting in more accountability overall.

## Modern work environments

Communication and teamwork are vital components to any organization and batch transcription can help create a collaborative work environment. Users can benefit from batch transcription, along with the diarization feature, to create more accessible and engaging meetings. Rather than spending time taking meeting notes, participants can focus on and engage with others in the meeting and know that they will be given a copy of the meeting after, ensuring they remember decisions made.

Further, workplaces can make use of the dictation function for creating documents, which can result in a modern workplace that utilizes the best of people's abilities. Dictation and batch transcription can save time because once the transcription starts it is faster than the audio runtime, meaning you get results quicker. You can also be confident that your industry-specific terminology won’t be misheard by utilizing custom models to create your transcriptions.
