Having poor-quality audio data transcribed quickly and accurately is the main problem we’ve been trying to solve in our scenario. Yet, there's even more that we can do with the transcriptions to better understand our customers and help our staff feel supported.

## Integrating for more business insights

You’ve found that Batch Transcription is the key to solving the problems your call center is facing, especially once you’ve added in customization. Yet, you recently found that can get even more from your audio data by integrating with other Azure services, such as Text Analytics, or *Azure Cognitive Search* for **Knowledge Mining, to find the patterns in your data** that can lead to more positive outcomes for your staff and customers. Further, you’ve found that by integrating with *Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI)*, you can better visualize this data to create deeper understanding of the data and make it easier to share with your company. Overall, resulting in your company getting the most information from the audio data.

## Beyond Call Centers

We’ve focused heavily on our call-center scenario to illustrate key features of Batch Transcription. We’ve discussed how it can provide rapid and robust transcription of audio files and how it can be customized for specific languages and phrases. We’ve also looked at how the use of Batch Transcription can open a door to deeper AI-powered analyses that leverage audio data to improve business practices.

There are various situations outside of our call-center scenario where Batch Transcription can provide real commercial or social benefit. Considering these scenarios, you may come up with other ideas on how you might integrate Batch Transcription into your applications.

### Increasing accessibility

Creating equitable environments that include everyone in the conversation is important, and Batch Transcription can help with that. For example, using Batch Transcription, you can create more inclusive media for people with hearing impairments through subtitles for videos, which are of great importance as hearing impairments are increasing around the world.

In the classroom, teachers are able to increase accessibility, comprehension, and retention by recording their verbal lectures and having them transcribed after for students to read. Teachers can also introduce dictation for students with difficulties manually typing. Rather than writing a paper, students can enable punctuation and dictate their ideas, and use Batch Transcription to accurately transcribe, promoting independence and creativity.

### Modern work environments

Communication and teamwork are vital components to any organization and Batch Transcription can help create a collaborative work environment. Users can benefit from Batch Transcription, along with the diarization feature, to create more accessible and engaging meetings. Rather than spending time taking meeting notes, participants can focus on and engage with others in the meeting and know that they'll be given a copy of the meeting after, ensuring they remember decisions that were made.

Further, workplaces can make use of the dictation function for creating documents, which can result in a modern workplace that utilizes the best of people's abilities. Dictation and Batch Transcription can save time because once the transcription starts it's faster than the audio runtime, meaning you get results quicker. By implementing custom models, you can also be confident that your industry-specific terminology won’t be misheard.
