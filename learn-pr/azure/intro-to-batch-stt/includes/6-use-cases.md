Understanding there may be many scenarios where batch transcription is required, we present a few considerations here that offer insight into some applications of Batch Transcription. Using these scenarios, you may come up with other ideas on how you might integrate Batch Transcription into your applications.

## Increasing Accessibility

Creating equitable environments that include everyone in the conversation is important, and batch transcriptions can help with that. For example, using batch transcription, you can create more inclusive media for people with hearing impairments through subtitles for videos, which is of great importance as hearing impairments are increasing around the world.

Further, teachers can increase accessibility, comprehension and retention in classrooms by recording their verbal lectures and having them transcribed after for students to read. Teachers can also introduce dictation for students with difficulties manually typing. Rather than writing a paper, students can enable punctuation and dictate their ideas, and use batch transcription to accurately transcribe, promoting independence and creativity.

## Meeting Compliance Standards

Many corporations and government agencies must meet compliance standards when interacting with customers, which is typically done by recording and monitoring phone calls. Yet, to meet the standard would require massive amounts of manual intervention and be prone to errors because of the difficult nature of transcribing telephone data. By using batch transcription companies and government bodies can have their calls transcribed at a faster rate because once the transcription starts, it is faster than real-time transcription.  Meaning meeting compliance standards becomes easier, resulting in more accountability overall.

## Modern work environments

Communication and teamwork are vital components to any organization and batch transcription can help create a collaborative work environment. Users can benefit from batch transcription, along with the diarization feature, to create more accessible and engaging meetings. Rather than spending time taking meeting notes, participants can focus on and engage with others in the meeting and know that they will be given a copy of the meeting after, ensuring they remember decisions made.

Further, workplaces can make use of the dictation function for creating documents, which can result in a modern workplace that utilizes the best of people's abilities. Dictation and batch transcription can save time because once the transcription starts it is faster than the audio runtime, meaning you get results quicker. You can also be confident that your industry-specific terminology wonâ€™t be misheard by utilizing custom models to create your transcriptions.
