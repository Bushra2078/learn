  title: Introduction to Batch Transcription
  description: Batch Transcription is an Azure cognitive service that enables you to transcribe very large amounts of pre-recorded audio data asynchronously. Batch Transcription’s high throughput makes it ideal for call centers that have to transcribe hundreds or thousands of calls every day to ensure they meet regulations and compliance standards. Batch Transcription also enables additional data analyses that can let call centers ensure that customer feedback is taken into account, that staff are treated fairly, and to ensure that problems are dealt with quickly and properly.
