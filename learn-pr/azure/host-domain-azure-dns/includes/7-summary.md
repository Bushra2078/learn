Your company wanted to manage all their infrastructure and related domain name information in one place.

You've seen how easy it was to manage DNS information by using an Azure DNS zone. The first step is changing the NS records at your domain registrar to point to it. You also learned how you could use Azure aliases to override the static A/AAAA/CNAME record to provide a dynamic reference to your resources.

Using a DNS Zone has improved your companies administration of resources, with your staff only needing one place to manage DNS-related tasks. Compared to managing the information between two or more different companies.
