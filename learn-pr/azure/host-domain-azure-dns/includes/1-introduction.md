Azure DNS enables you to host your DNS records for your domains on Azure infrastructure. It uses the anycast networking routing methodology to choose a route to the closest available DNS server. Using Azure DNS, you can use the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

Your company recently bought the custom domain name wideworldimporters.com from a third-party domain name registrar. The domain name is for a new website your organization plans to launch. You need a hosting service for DNS domains. This hosting service would resolve the wideworldimporters.com domain to the IP address of your web server.

You're already using Azure to build your website. You decide to use Azure DNS to manage your domain.

This module will show you how to configure Azure DNS to host your domain. You'll also see how to add alias and other DNS record to successfully resolve your domain name to a working website.
