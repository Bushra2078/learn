Monitoring your database can provide valuable information about the types and frequency of queries being executed against your data, and who is running those queries. Data collected from monitoring can also help you troubleshoot and optimize your multitenant Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL cluster.

Tailspin Toys requested that you devise a solution to monitor activity in the database and provide a mechanism for identifying which tenants are most active and using more resources than others. Tailspin Toys is interested in learning more about:

- Which tenant is most active and using the most database resources?
- How many queries are spanning shards?
- Are any tenants creating load hot spots?

## Monitor per-tenant statistics

When you monitor activity in a multitenant SaaS database, it's crucial that you can view database usage and statistics on a per-tenant basis so that you understand the impact each tenant has on database performance. The `citus_stat_statements` view allows you to get clear insights into what your tenants are doing.

```sql
SELECT * FROM citus_stat_statements;
```

```text
-[ RECORD 1 ]-+---------------------------------------------------------
-
queryid       | -7719494451205117063
userid        | 16384
dbid          | 16385
query         | SELECT p.product_id, p.name FROM stores AS s
              |     INNER JOIN products AS p ON s.store_id = p.store_id
              |     WHERE s.store_id = $1
executor      | adaptive
partition_key | 336
calls         | 2
-[ RECORD 2 ]-+---------------------------------------------------------
-
queryid       | -5037935943477454275
userid        | 16384
dbid          | 16385
query         | SELECT p.product_id,
              |         p.name,
              |         SUM(l.quantity) AS total_ordered,
              |         COUNT(p.product_id) AS count_of_orders_containing_product
              |     FROM products AS p
              |     INNER JOIN line_items AS l ON p.store_id = l.store_id AND p.product_id = l.product_id
              |     WHERE p.store_id = $1
              |     GROUP BY p.store_id, p.product_id
              |     ORDER BY total_ordered DESC
              |     LIMIT $2
executor      | adaptive
partition_key | 5
calls         | 1
```

Inspecting the output, you can see that each record includes the query that was executed and the `parition_key` (that is, tenant ID) that executed the query. For cross-partition queries, the `partition_key` value is empty. This information allows you to write queries against the `citus_stat_statements` table specific to individual tenants.

## Identify "noisy" tenants

Due to the differences in store sizes in the Tailspin Toys multitenant SaaS application, you suspect some of the larger tenants are "noisier" than others, meaning they use a higher percentage of database resources and cause performance degradation for other, smaller tenants. By joining `citus_stat_statements` with `pg_stat_statements`, you can retrieve per-tenant statics and trace queries to originating tenants in the Tailspin Toys multitenant application.

```sql
SELECT partition_key as tenant_id, 
    count(*) as tenant_unique_queries, 
    sum(c.calls) as tenant_total_queries,
    sum(total_exec_time) as total_query_time 
FROM citus_stat_statements AS c
INNER JOIN pg_stat_statements AS p ON c.queryid = p.queryid
WHERE partition_key is not null
GROUP BY tenant_id
ORDER BY tenant_total_queries DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This information provided by this query can help identify tenants to isolate, showing which tenants are executing the highest number of queries and consuming the most query execution time.

```text
 tenant_id | tenant_unique_queries | tenant_total_queries | total_query_time
-----------+-----------------------+----------------------+------------------
 5         |                   148 |               159295 |        753142.54
 336       |                  2045 |                23846 |         12957.83
 147       |                    74 |                 9572 |          8492.05
 282       |                   175 |                12753 |          6876.11
 222       |                   375 |                 3653 |          6422.93
```

## Identify tenants that use the most storage space

Determining the amount of storage space used per tenant in the Tailspin Toys database requires using several built-in Citus functions. The following example query uses a common table expression (CTE) to calculate the percentage of the `orders` table size for by each tenant. The CTE is then referenced to retrieve the `shardid` associated with each store and calculate the percentage of storage space used as a function of the overall `orders` table size. In addition, the percentage of storage used in the shard is determined.

```sql
-- Get the percentage of table and shard size per tenant
WITH order_percentage AS (
    SELECT 
        store_id,
        COUNT(store_id) / SUM(count(*)) OVER() AS pct_of_orders
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY store_id
    ORDER BY pct_of_orders DESC
)
SELECT store_id,
    (SELECT get_shard_id_for_distribution_column('orders', store_id)) AS shardid,
    pg_size_pretty(pct_of_orders * citus_table_size('orders')) AS storage_space_used,
    ROUND(pct_of_orders, 4) AS percent_of_table_size,
    ROUND((
        SELECT (pct_of_orders * citus_table_size('orders'))/SUM(shard_size)
        FROM citus_shards
        WHERE shardid = (SELECT get_shard_id_for_distribution_column('orders', store_id))
    ), 4) AS percent_of_shard_size
FROM order_percentage
LIMIT 5;
```

The function references the shard information view (`citus_shards`) to retrieve the size of each shard hosting `order` table data, and the built-in `get_shard_id_for_distribution_column()` function to locate the specific shards hosting `order` table data.

Using this query, you can find tenants that occupy a high percentage of space in the shard in which they reside. Resource contention can often happen when one or a few tenants comprise a large portion of the data in an individual shard. This query provides information that can help identify tenants that are potential candidates for isolation or might indicate rebalancing is required.

## Monitor cross-shard versus single-shard queries

In the Tailspin Toys multitenant database, you would expect most queries to target a single tenant and run on a single shard. By using `citus_stat_statements`, you can query for the percentage of queries that span across shards. Seeing too many multitenant (that is, cross-shard) queries indicates the proper filters might not be applied to correctly match a single tenant, resulting in unnecessary network calls, slower performance, and possible security issues.

To view a breakdown of how many cross-shard versus single-shard queries are happening in the database, you can run the following code:

```sql
SELECT to_char((cross_shard * 100) / total, '99D99') as cross_shard, 
       to_char((shard * 100) / total, '99D99') as shard
FROM (
    SELECT 
       sum(calls) AS total, 
       sum(calls) FILTER (WHERE partition_key is NULL) AS cross_shard, 
       sum(calls) FILTER (WHERE partition_key is not null) AS shard 
    FROM citus_stat_statements
) AS t;
```

For multitenant SaaS applications, there are typically a few cross-tenant queries executed by the SaaS provider. These queries are commonly used to collect internal statistics about customers and how they use the application. However, the Tailspin Toys tenant stores are prohibited from viewing each other's data, so monitoring the percentage of cross-shard queries can be a valuable tool in validating application queries are working as expected. A noteworthy increase in this ratio might indicate that queries aren't filtering as expected.

```text
 cross_shard | shard  
-------------+--------
   7.14      |  92.86
```

This query provides a clear view into the percentage of queries executed in the database that are cross-shard and could potentially be optimized. From here, you can determine a baseline for the percentage of cross-shard queries coming from your SaaS application and analytics and monitoring solutions. If you see an increase in cross-shard queries after application updates, you should raise errors or send alerts on cross-shard application queries, and gradually start removing them from your app or modifying them accordingly.

## Monitor skewness and rebalance shards

In the Tailspin Toys multitenant SaaS application, some tenants are larger than others and receive many more orders, creating load hot spots. Over time, this uneven distribution of order data can result in some shards becoming skewed, meaning they contain more data and occupy more space than others. The nodes that store the largest shards ultimately do more work than nodes that have less data. This work distribution affects overall system and query performance.

By querying the `citus_shards` values, you can view and compare the total size of the shards on each node for your tables:

```sql
SELECT table_name, nodename, SUM(shard_size) AS size
FROM citus_shards
GROUP BY table_name, nodename 
ORDER BY table_name, size DESC;
```

If you view the shard size values for Tailspin Toys, you can see that one node for both `orders` and `line_items` is almost twice the size of the other nodes. This size difference is a good indicator of skewness. Here's example of the output:

```text
 table_name |                              nodename                               |   size    
------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
 stores     | private-c.learn-cosmosdb-postgresql-kb.postgres.database.azure.com  |     90112
 stores     | private-w0.learn-cosmosdb-postgresql-kb.postgres.database.azure.com |     90112

 orders     | private-c.learn-cosmosdb-postgresql-kb.postgres.database.azure.com  | 225689600
 orders     | private-w0.learn-cosmosdb-postgresql-kb.postgres.database.azure.com | 124985344
 orders     | private-w1.learn-cosmosdb-postgresql-kb.postgres.database.azure.com | 120225792
 line_items | private-c.learn-cosmosdb-postgresql-kb.postgres.database.azure.com  | 437911552
 line_items | private-w0.learn-cosmosdb-postgresql-kb.postgres.database.azure.com | 239124480
 line_items | private-w1.learn-cosmosdb-postgresql-kb.postgres.database.azure.com | 227508224
```

You can also use the Azure portal to inspect skewness and get a recommendation about whether rebalancing is recommended.

![Screenshot of the Shard rebalancer pane of the Azure CosmosDB for PostgreSQL Cluster, with the Shard rebalancer menu selected and highlighted. The Rebalancing is recommended header is highlighted, as are the node sizes for each cluster.](../media/cosmos-db-postgresql-shard-rebalancer.png)

Rebalancing moves shards between nodes, more evenly distributing data. The shard rebalancer handles this process without downtime or disruption to the database. You can run the rebalancer by executing the `rebalance_table_shards()` function.

```sql
SELECT rebalance_table_shards('orders', rebalance_strategy:='by_disk_size');
```

The function rebalances all tables in the same colocation group, so repeating the process for every distributed table is unnecessary.

After initiating the shard rebalancer, you'll see an output indicating which shards are being moved and to what node they're moving. Running the query against `citus_shards` again to view shard sizes per table reveals the total shard sizes on each node are more evenly distributed.

```text
 table_name |                              nodename                               |   size

```

It's important to note that standard shard rebalancing distributes shards to equalize node storage usage. It doesn't examine which tenants are allocated on each shard, so while it can improve overall performance, it might or might not enhance the mixing of large and small tenants.
