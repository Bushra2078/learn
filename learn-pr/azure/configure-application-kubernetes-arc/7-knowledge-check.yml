  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: You plan to create an AKS cluster and configure it with the App Service extension. Which operating system can you use for worker nodes?
    choices:
    - content: Linux only
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: App Service on Azure Arc support only Linux node pools in AKS clusters.
    - content: Linux or Windows
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: App Service on Azure Arc support only Linux node pools in AKS clusters.
    - content: Windows only
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: App Service on Azure Arc support only Linux node pools in AKS clusters.
  - content: You have an Azure Arc-enabled AKS cluster. You created a custom location and are planning to create an Azure web app on the cluster. What do you have to do first?
    choices:
    - content: Create an Azure App Service plan.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't have to explicitly create an App Service plan. If a plan doesn't exist, the platform will automatically provision it when you create the web app.
    - content: Register an App Service Kubernetes environment.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: An App Service Kubernetes environment must exist before you can create an App Service web app.
    - content: Install the Azure App Service extension.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Installation of the Azure App Service extension needs to take place before you create a custom location.
  - content: You created an AKS cluster and connected it to Azure Arc. You plan to install the App Service extension. You need to identify which resource group to use to host the public IP address resource associated with the AKS cluster's load balancer. Which resource group should you use?
    choices:
    - content: the infrastructure group of the AKS cluster
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You must create the public IP address resource in the cluster's infrastructure resource group so it'll bind to the cluster's load balancer.
    - content: the resource group containing the AKS cluster
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This resource group contains only the AKS cluster resource. You must create the public IP address resource in the cluster's infrastructure resource group so it'll bind to the cluster's load balancer.
    - content: the resource group that contains the Azure Arc resources
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This resource group doesn't contain the cluster's load balancer resource. You must create the public IP address resource in the cluster's infrastructure resource group so it'll bind to the cluster's load balancer.
  - content: You implemented the Azure App Service extension on your AKS cluster and created an App Service web app. Which method can you use for deploying your custom code to the web app?
    choices:
    - content: FTP publishing.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There are no plans for implementing support for FTP publishing for App Service on Azure Arc.
    - content: ZIP file deployment.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ZIP file deployment is a supported deployment method for App Service on Azure Arc.
    - content: A local workspace deployment by running `az webapp up`.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This method isn't currently.
