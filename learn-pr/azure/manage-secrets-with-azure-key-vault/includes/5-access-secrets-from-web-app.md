Now that you know how enabling-managed identities for Azure resources creates an identity for your app to use for authentication, you'll create an app that uses that identity to access secrets in the vault.

## Read secrets in an ASP.NET Core app

Azure Key Vault API is a REST API that handles all management and usage of keys and vaults. Each secret in a vault has a unique URL, and secret values are retrieved with HTTP GET requests.

The official Key Vault client for .NET Core is the `SecretClient` class in the Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets NuGet package; however, you don't need to use it directly. With ASP.NET Core's `AddAzureKeyVault` method, you can load all the secrets from a vault into the Configuration API at startup. This technique enables you to access all of your secrets by name using the same `IConfiguration` interface you use for the rest of your configuration. Apps that use `AddAzureKeyVault` require both **Get** and **List** permissions to the vault.

> [!TIP]
> Regardless of the framework or language you use to build your app, you should design it to cache secret values locally or load them into memory at startup unless you have a specific reason not to. Reading them directly from the vault every time you need them is unnecessarily slow and expensive.

`AddAzureKeyVault` only requires the vault name as an input, which we'll get from our local app configuration. It also automatically handles managed identity authentication &mdash; when used in an app deployed to Azure App Service with managed identities for Azure resources enabled, it will detect the managed identities token service and use it to authenticate. It's a good fit for most scenarios and implements all best practices, and we'll use it in this unit's exercise.

## Read secrets in a Node.js app

Azure Key Vault API is a REST API that handles all management and usage of keys and vaults. Each secret in a vault has a unique URL, and secret values are retrieved with HTTP GET requests.

The official Key Vault client for Node.js apps is the `SecretClient` class in the `@azure/keyvault-secrets` npm package. Apps that include secret names in their configuration or code will generally only need to use its `getSecret` method, which loads a secret value given its name. `getSecret` requires your app's identity to have the **Get** permission on the vault. Apps designed to load all secrets from a vault will also use the `listPropertiesOfSecrets` method, which loads a list of secrets and requires the **List** permission.

Before your app can create a `SecretClient` instance, it must get a credential object for authenticating to the vault. To authenticate, use the `DefaultAzureCredential` provided by the `@azure/identity` npm package. The `DefaultAzureCredential` is appropriate for most scenarios where the application is intended to ultimately be run in the Azure Cloud. This is because the `DefaultAzureCredential` combines credentials commonly used to authenticate when deployed, with credentials used to authenticate in a development environment. The `DefaultAzureCredential` will attempt to authenticate via the following mechanisms in order:

* Environment - The `DefaultAzureCredential` will read account information specified via environment variables and use it to authenticate.
* Managed Identity - If the application is deployed to an Azure host with Managed Identity enabled, the `DefaultAzureCredential` will authenticate with that account.
* Visual Studio Code - If the developer has authenticated via the Visual Studio Code Azure Account plugin, the `DefaultAzureCredential` will authenticate with that account.
* Azure CLI - If the developer has authenticated an account via the Azure CLI az login command, the `DefaultAzureCredential` will authenticate with that account.

For more information, see the [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/identity/identity/README.md#defaultazurecredential).

## Handle secrets in an app

After a secret is loaded into your app, it's up to your app to handle it securely. In the app you build in this module, you'll write your secret value out to the client response, and to demonstrate that it has been loaded successfully, you'll view it in a web browser. **Returning a secret value to the client is *not* something you'd normally do!** Usually, you'll use secrets to do things like initialize client libraries for databases or remote APIs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always carefully review your code to ensure that your app never writes secrets to any kind of output, including logs, storage, and responses.

## Exercise

::: zone pivot="csharp"

To load the secret from our vault, you'll create a new ASP.NET Core web API, and use `AddAzureKeyVault`.

### Create the app

In Azure Cloud Shell, to create a new ASP.NET Core web API app and open it in the editor, run the following command.

```console
dotnet new webapi -o KeyVaultDemoApp
cd KeyVaultDemoApp
code .
```

After the editor loads, add the NuGet package containing `AddAzureKeyVault` and restore all of the app's dependencies.
In Azure Cloud Shell, run the following commands.

```console
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
dotnet add package Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets
dotnet restore
```

### Add code to load and use secrets

To demonstrate good use of Key Vault, modify your app to load secrets from the vault at startup. You'll also add a new controller with an endpoint that gets your **SecretPassword** secret from the vault.

1. For the app startup, enter the following command to launch the editor

  ```console
  code .
  ```

1. Open `Program.cs`, delete the contents, and replace them with the following code.

  ```csharp
  using System;
  using Azure.Identity;
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore;
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
  using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
  using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

  namespace KeyVaultDemoApp
  {
      public class Program
      {
          public static void Main(string[] args)
          {
              CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
          }

          public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
              Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                  .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
                  {
                      webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
                  })
                  .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) =>
                  {
                      // Build the current set of configuration to load values from
                      // JSON files and environment variables, including VaultName.
                      var builtConfig = config.Build();

                      // Use VaultName from the configuration to create the full vault URL.
                      var vaultName = builtConfig["VaultName"];
                      Uri vaultUri = new Uri($"https://{vaultName}.vault.azure.net/");

                      // Load all secrets from the vault into configuration. This will automatically
                      // authenticate to the vault using a managed identity. If a managed identity
                      // is not available, it will check if Visual Studio and/or the Azure CLI are
                      // installed locally and see if they are configured with credentials that can
                      // access the vault.
                      config.AddAzureKeyVault(vaultUri, new DefaultAzureCredential());
                  });
      }
  }
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Make sure to save files when you're done editing them. You can do this either through the "..." menu, or the accelerator key (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux, <kbd>Cmd+S</kbd> on macOS).

  The only change from the starter code is the addition of `ConfigureAppConfiguration`. This is where we load the vault name from configuration and call `AddAzureKeyVault` with it.

1. For the controller, create a new file in the `Controllers` folder called `SecretTestController.cs`, and paste in the following code.

  > [!TIP]
  > To create a new file, use the `touch` command in Cloud Shell. In this case, run the `touch Controllers/SecretTestController.cs` command. To see it there, in the top right corner of the *Files* pane of the editor, select the Refresh icon.

  ```csharp
  using System;
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
  using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

  namespace KeyVaultDemoApp.Controllers
  {
      [Route("api/[controller]")]
      public class SecretTestController : ControllerBase
      {
          private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

          public SecretTestController(IConfiguration configuration)
          {
              _configuration = configuration;
          }

          [HttpGet]
          public IActionResult Get()
          {
              // Get the secret value from configuration. This can be done anywhere
              // we have access to IConfiguration. This does not call the Key Vault
              // API, because the secrets were loaded at startup.
              var secretName = "SecretPassword";
              var secretValue = _configuration[secretName];

              if (secretValue == null)
              {
                  return StatusCode(
                      StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError,
                      $"Error: No secret named {secretName} was found...");
              }
              else {
                  return Content($"Secret value: {secretValue}" +
                      Environment.NewLine + Environment.NewLine +
                      "This is for testing only! Never output a secret " +
                      "to a response or anywhere else in a real app!");
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

1. Run the `dotnet build` command in Azure Cloud Shell to make sure everything compiles. The app is ready to run &mdash; now let's get it into Azure!

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="javascript"

We'll create a new web API with Express.js and use the `@azure/keyvault-secrets` and `@azure/identity` packages to load the secret from our vault.

### Create the app

In Azure Cloud Shell, to initialize a new Node.js app, install the needed packages, open a new file in the editor, and run the following code.

```console
mkdir KeyVaultDemoApp
cd KeyVaultDemoApp
npm init -y
npm install @azure/identity @azure/keyvault-secrets express
touch app.js
code app.js
```

### Add code to load and use secrets

To demonstrate good use of Key Vault, your app will load secrets from the vault at startup. To demonstrate that your secrets have been loaded, you'll create an endpoint that displays the value of the **SecretPassword** secret.

1. To set up the app, paste the following code into the editor. This will import the necessary packages, set up the port and vault URL configuration, and create a new object to hold the secret names and values.

  ```javascript
  // Importing dependencies
  const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
  const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");
  const app = require('express')();

  // Initialize port
  const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

  // Create Vault URL from App Settings
  const vaultUrl = `https://${process.env.VaultName}.vault.azure.net/`;

  // Map of key vault secret names to values
  let vaultSecretsMap = {};
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Make sure to save files as you work on them, especially when you're finished. You can do this either through the "..." menu, or the accelerator key (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux, <kbd>Cmd+S</kbd> on macOS).

1. Next, you'll add the code to authenticate to the vault and load the secrets. You'll add this as two separate functions. Insert a couple of blank lines after the code you previously added, and then paste in the following code.

  ```javascript
  const getKeyVaultSecrets = async () => {
    // Create a key vault secret client
    let secretClient = new SecretClient(vaultUri, new DefaultAzureCredential());
    try {
      // Iterate through each secret in the vault
      listPropertiesOfSecrets = client.listPropertiesOfSecrets();
      while (true) {
        let { done, value } = await listPropertiesOfSecrets.next();
        if (done) {
          break;
        }
        // Only load enabled secrets - getSecret will return an error for disabled secrets
        if (value.enabled) {
          const secret = await client.getSecret(value.name);
          vaultSecretsMap[value.name] = secret.value;
        }
      }
    } catch(err) {
      console.log(err.message)
    }
  }
  ```

1. To test whether our secret was loaded, create the Express endpoint. Paste in this code.

  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/SecretTest', (req, res) => {
    let secretName = 'SecretPassword';
    let response;
    if (secretName in vaultSecretsMap) {
      response = `Secret value: ${vaultSecretsMap[secretName]}\n\nThis is for testing only! Never output a secret to a response or anywhere else in a real app!`;
    } else {
      response = `Error: No secret named ${secretName} was found...`
    }
    res.type('text');
    res.send(response);
  });
  ```

1. Lastly, you'll call our functions to load the secrets from our vault, then start the app. To complete the app, paste in this last snippet.

  ```javascript
  (async () =>  {
    await getKeyVaultSecrets();
    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
  })().catch(err => console.log(err));
  ```

1. You're finished writing code, so make sure to save the file.

The app is ready to run &mdash; now let's get it into Azure!
