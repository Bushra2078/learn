title: Manage secrets in your web apps with Azure Key Vault
summary: "Your application requires service passwords, connection strings and other secret configuration values to do its job. Storing and handling secret values is risky, and every usage introduces the possibility of leakage. Azure Key Vault, in combination with App Service’s Managed Service Identity feature, enables your Azure Web App to access secret configuration values easily and securely without needing to store any secrets in your source control or configuration."
cardDescription: Securely store secret configuration values in Key Vault and access it securely from your Azure web app with Managed Service Identity.
