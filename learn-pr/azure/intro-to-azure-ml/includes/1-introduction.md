Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a cloud-based environment where you can build and manage machine learning models. It’s designed to govern the entire ML life cycle, so you can train and deploy models without focusing on setup. The platform is suitable for any kind of machine learning, from classical to deep learning, to supervised and unsupervised learning.

Azure ML is structured to help teams of data scientists and ML engineers make the most of their existing data processing and model development skills. Whether you prefer _Python_ or _R_—or have previous experience with other open-source platforms such as _PyTorch_ and _TensorFlow_—Azure ML is flexible enough to support these platforms and accelerate your work.

With in-built services, like Azure ML Studio that provide a user-friendly interface, and Automated Machine Learning capabilities that assist you in model selection and training—Azure ML has tools and features to suit every level of experience.
