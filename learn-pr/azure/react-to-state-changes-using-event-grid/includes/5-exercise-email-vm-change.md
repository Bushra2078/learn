You're ready to perform an action based on your logic app receiving a published event.

In the previous exercise, you completed the initial setup of the logic app. Now, you now need the logic app to send an email notification that contains details whenever any change occurs to any virtual machine in your resource group.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to set up a condition that enables the logic app to inspect a published event, respond with a logic app action, and send an email.

## Add a condition

First, let's create a condition that runs the logic app whenever a certain event is published.

1. In the Azure portal, the Logic app you just created should be active. If not, select **Home**, and under **Recent resources**, select the Logic app you just created.

1. In the **Logic app** menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Logic app designer**. The **Logic app designer** pane for your logic app appears.

1. In the event grid under **When a resource event occurs**, select **New step**. The **Choose an operation** pane appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-choose-new-step-condition.png" alt-text="Icon for a new logic app step.":::

1. In the *Search connectors and actions* search box, enter *condition* as your filter, and the press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. From the results, select **Control**.- The control workflow dialog box appears. 

1. On the **Actions** tab, select **Condition** *Control*.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-select-condition.png" alt-text="Conditions for choosing an action.":::

    The Logic app designer adds an empty condition to your workflow, including action paths to follow, based on a true or false condition.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-empty-condition.png" alt-text="Empty condition.":::

1. In the **Condition** title bar, select the ellipsis icon and in the context menu, select **Rename**. Enter *If a virtual machine in your resource group has changed*.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-rename-condition.png" alt-text="Selections for renaming a condition.":::

1. In the condition work area, select **Choose a value**, and then select the **Expression** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-condition-choose-expression.png" alt-text="Selections for choosing an expression as a value.":::

1. In the function field, enter the value `triggerBody()?['data']['operationName']`, and select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-condition-add-data-operation-name.png" alt-text="Entered expression for a data operation.":::

1. Leave the middle box as **is equal to**, then select the remaining **Choose a value** box, and enter the value `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`, and then select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-complete-condition.png" alt-text="Completed condition.":::

1. In the **Logic app designer** command bar, select **Save**.

## Send an email notification

Now we can add an email action based on the logic app being triggered. The following steps use Office 365 Outlook. If you don't have an Office 365 account, you can also use Outlook.com or Gmail. The configuration steps for these email programs may differ, so you may need to adjust accordingly.

1. In your Logic app's **Logic app designer** pane, in the *When a resource event occurs" condition's **True** box, select **Add an action**. The **Choose an operation** pane appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-condition-true-add-action.png" alt-text="Add an action button.":::

1. In the *Search connectors and actions* search box, enter *send an email* as your filter, and then select the **Office 365 Outlook** provider.

1. From the results list, scroll down to and select **Send an email (V2)**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-logic-app-send-email.png" alt-text="Selections for sending an email action.":::

1. If you don't already have a connection for your email provider, you may be prompted to sign in to your email account. Select sign in and allow the authorization to complete.

1. On the action's title bar, select the ellipsis, and rename the *Send an email (V2)* to action to *Send email when virtual machine updates*.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-send-email-vm-update.png" alt-text="Screenshot for sending an email when vm updates.":::

1. Select each input box in the email form, and on the **Dynamic content** tab, search for and select the appropriate content type, adding text to label the items in the email body. In the *To* box, add your own email address to test the workflow in the next section.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-logic-app-empty-email-action.png" alt-text="Selection for adding a subject as a dynamic email field.":::

1. Your email action should look similar to the following. If you selected a different email account type (Outlook.com or Gmail), your inputs might differ.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-logic-app-send-email-details.png" alt-text="Email action view.":::

1. Your finished logic app should look similar to the following screenshot.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-logic-app-completed.png" alt-text="View of a finished logic app.":::

1. In the command bar, select **Save** to save your logic app.

## Test your workflow

You've created and configured a logic app to listen for virtual machine events and send an email notification. Event details are dynamically written into the body of the email.

The final step is to test the complete workflow.

1. In the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, search for **vm1**, and select the virtual machine in the results. Your **vm1** virtual machine pane appears.

1. In the left menu pane, under **Settings**, select **Size**.

1. Select a new size of **DS2_v2** for the virtual machine, and then select **Resize**. 

1. Wait to be notified that your virtual machine has been resized, allowing time for the email to be generated and processed. After a few minutes, you should receive an email that looks similar to the following:
