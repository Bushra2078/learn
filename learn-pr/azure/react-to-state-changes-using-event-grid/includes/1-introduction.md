In a complex cloud environment, you might need to respond to events from many different sources both automatically and manually.

Suppose, for example, you work on an operations team for a large healthcare organization. You have a set of dedicated client virtual machines that are under strict regulatory and change control to comply with regulation in your jurisdiction. You want to be notified of any changes to the configuration of these virtual machines in Azure by email. 

In this module, you'll create an app in the Azure Logic Apps service that sends emails. The app will use Azure Event Grid to intercept events that happen to virtual machines.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Event Grid to manage and route event notifications to the right destinations for your requirements.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Describe the capabilities and use cases for Event Grid
- Create an application that handles events with Event Grid and Logic Apps

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription
- An email account to receive notifications
