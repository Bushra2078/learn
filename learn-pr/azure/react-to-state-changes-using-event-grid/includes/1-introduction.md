In a complex cloud environment, you might need to respond to events from many different sources both automatically and manually.

Suppose you work on an operations team for a large healthcare organization. You have a system with virtual machines that are under strict regulatory and change control. You want to be notified of any changes to the configuration of these virtual machines in Azure by email. To accomplish this, you'll use Azure Event Grid to receive events that happen to virtual machines and an Azure Logic Apps to send emails alerting your team of any changes.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Event Grid to manage and route event notifications to the right destinations for your requirements.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Describe the capabilities and use cases for Event Grid
- Create an application that handles events with Event Grid and Logic Apps

## Prerequisites
