## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *React to state changes in your Azure services using Event Grid*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You work on an operations team for a large organization. You have a set of dedicated client virtual machines that are under strict regulatory and change control, and need to be notified if there are any changes to the virtual machines on Azure. You would like to receive emails if there are any changes to these virtual machines, so that you can address any issues as they arise.
