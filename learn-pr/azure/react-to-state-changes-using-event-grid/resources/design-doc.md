## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *React to state changes in your Azure services using Event Grid*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Trigger a logic app with Event Grid | "...and need to be notified if there are any changes to the virtual machines on Azure" | Exercise | Describe the capabilities and use cases for Event Grid | Yes |
| Build logic that responds to an event | "You would like to receive emails if there are any changes to these virtual machines..." | Exercise | Create an application that handles events with Event Grid and Logic Apps | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You work on an operations team for a large organization. You have a set of dedicated client virtual machines that are under strict regulatory and change control, and need to be notified if there are any changes to the virtual machines on Azure. You would like to receive emails if there are any changes to these virtual machines, so that you can address any issues as they arise.

1. **Trigger a logic app with Event Grid**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *Trigger a logic app with Event Grid*:

    - Use Event Grid to trigger a response in Azure
        - What is Event Grid?
        - Capabilities and use cases for Event Grid
        - Common event sources and event handlers
        - Topics and event subscriptions
    - Create a logic app triggered by Event Grid
        - What is Azure Logic Apps?
        - What are connectors and triggers?
        - The Azure Event Grid connector with its triggers and actions
        - The Logic Apps Designer

    > [!NOTE]
    > Focus on Event Grid. We are using the logic app only as something that can be triggered from Event Grid. Provide the students with enough information about Logic Apps to understand this process but the module is not about Logic Apps.

1. **Exercise - Trigger a logic app with Event Grid**

    List the steps, which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Create a virtual machine
        - Either in the portal or by running an Azure CLI command in the Cloud Shell
    1. Create a blank logic app
        - Complete **Create** page in Azure portal
        - Select a blank template for the logic app
    1. Add an Event Grid trigger
        - Sign into Event Grid
        - Subscribe to the event
        - Save the incomplete logic app

1. **Build logic that responds to an event**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *Build logic that responds to an event*:

    - Build logic using the Logic Apps designer
        - What are actions?
        - What are conditions, switches, loops, and branches?
    - Edit a logic app's JSON code
        - The Logic Apps code view editor
        - Using Visual Studio Code to edit a logic app
        - Editing JSON generated by the Event Grid connector

1. **Exercise - Email users when virtual machines change**

    List the steps, which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Add a condition
        - Check the event body for a data object where the operationName property is equal to Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write
    1. Send an email notification
        - Add the Send an Email action in the If true box of the condition
        - Full in the student's own email address with a subject and body
        - Examine the logic app JSON source code, including the Event Grid connector code.
        - Save the logic app
    1. Test the logic app
        - Resize the virtual machine
        - Examine the email received from the logic app
        - Review the trigger history for the logic app

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module? 

    Your organization needed to carefully control the configuration of its virtual machines in Azure to comply with regulations. You needed to ensure that, when virtual machines were modified, administrators were notified so they could check the new setup. By creating a logic app in Azure and using an Event Grid trigger, you ensured that Azure could respond to such configuration changes and send an email to administrators.

    By using an Event Grid trigger in Azure Logic Apps, you can complete this task without writing any code, unless to prefer to edit your logic app's JSON definition manually. By enabling administrators to intercept and respond to events without custom code, Event Grid makes it easy to ensure compliance with regulations.

## Notes

The [Email when VM changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/monitor-virtual-machine-changes-event-grid-logic-app) tutorial can be used as a basis for the steps. Will need to adjust it to our scenario.
