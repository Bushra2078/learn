Many organizations today work with big data. Because of the huge volume and variety of this data and the speed of data generation, you need systems that help you manage and control this data. In the past, organizations attempted data control by using relational databases management systems. However, it's the functionality of open-source software, combined with the benefits of hosted platforms, that have begun to reap success. Azure HDInsight is the perfect example. You can use HDInsight to process big data in many scenarios, either with historical or real-time data.

The following graphic depicts an overview of how you might use HDInsight. Various data sources are depicted, including IoT sensors, databases, and several Azure datastores. HDInsight processes the data from these locations, making it available in long-term storage, for real-time apps, and for additional analysis.

## Example scenario

Let's imagine you work for an organization that builds workloads that involve ingesting data for historical reporting and advanced analytics. Perhaps you also have streaming data that requires analysis. In this situation, you could consider HDInsight. Using HDInsight, all your data can be ingested into a single Data Lake location. You can then use the HDInsight to manage the following workloads:

- Batch processing
- Data Warehousing
- Data Science operations
- Streaming

## What will we be doing?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to evaluate whether HDInsight can help your organization process big data. You'll also be able to describe how HDInsight uses popular open-source frameworks that support numerous data scenarios.

## What is the main goal?

The main goal is to be able to determine if HDInsight is a suitable choice for your requirements for big-data processing.
