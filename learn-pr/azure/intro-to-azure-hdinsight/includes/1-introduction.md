## Example scenario

Let's imagine you work for an organization that builds workloads that involve ingesting data for historical reporting and advanced analytics. Perhaps you also have streaming data that requires analysis. In this situation, you could consider HDInsight. Using HDInsight, all your data can be ingested into a single Data Lake location. You can then use the HDInsight to manage the following workloads: 

- Batch processing
- Data Warehousing
- Data Science operations
- Streaming
