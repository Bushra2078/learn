  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your workload to scale performs cpu intensive photo transformation, which option should you choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "KEDA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can use KEDA to scale cpu intensive workloads, a HPA is the best choice."
    - content: "HPA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In this case, using a HPA is the best choice for cpu intensive workloads."
    - content: "Cluster Autoscaler"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cluster autoscaler is for scaling the number of nodes in a kubernetes cluster"
  - content: "Your cluster is getting close to utilizing all its available resources during peak times.  Which option should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "KEDA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using KEDA will not increase the total available resources for a cluster."
    - content: "HPA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using a HPA will not increase the total available resources for a cluster"
    - content: "Cluster Autoscaler"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Cluster autoscaler is for scaling the number of nodes in a kubernetes cluster"
  - content: "Your service processes messages from an Apache Kafka queue, which option should you choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "KEDA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using KEDA is the ideal choice to scale resources based on received events"
    - content: "HPA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can use a HPA to scale this service, it is not efficient and fails to measure the quantity of messages in the queue."
    - content: "Cluster Autoscaler"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cluster autoscaler is for scaling the number of nodes in a kubernetes cluster"
