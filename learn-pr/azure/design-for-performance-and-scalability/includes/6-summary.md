# Performance and Scalability - Summary

Congratulations, you have completed the module on Performance and Scalability. Let's recap what we have covered:

## Scaling up and Scaling out

* The difference between scaling up/down (the level of resource provisioned on an instance) and scaling in/out (increasing or decreasing the number of available instances). We also discussed examples in Azure of each
* The considerations to be made when scaling in/out around state management and application startup times
* Autoscale, and how it can help you scale the number of instances based on a schedule or the demand of an application (e.g. CPU utilization or queue depth)
* Discussed alternate technologies that may help with scalability including serverless (consumption based resources) and containers.

## Optimize network performance

## Optimize storage performance
