Imagine you're a Java developer working for a company that creates SpringBoot apps that currently run on on-premises servers. Your app also integrates to a relational database (in this case MySQL). You decide to migrate this Spring app to the Azure app service and want to make the migration as smooth as possible.

In this module, you will first create a Spring boot web app using the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) and configure it to run locally. You'll then deploy and host it as an Azure App Service.

By the end of this module, you'll learn to incorporate SpringBoot apps to Azure App Service and integrate with a relational database.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Develop a SpringBoot Web App
- Connect your App to a MySQL database
- Deploy the web app to Azure App services

## Prerequisites

- Experience writing Spring Apps in Java
- Experience working with MySQL databases
- Experience working with Azure Web Apps
