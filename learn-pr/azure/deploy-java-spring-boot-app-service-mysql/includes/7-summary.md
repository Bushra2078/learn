Congratulations! You've deployed to a Spring Boot Web application to Azure App Service.

Your company wanted to learn how they could migrate their existing Spring Boot Java web applications to Azure App Service. You used the following steps:

1. You created a sample Spring Boot web application.

1. You created a MySQL database, connected your Spring Boot web application, and tested it locally.

1. Once you verified that your application was working successfully, you added the Maven Plugin for Azure App Service to your project and configured it interactively.

1. You updated your web application, redeployed it to Azure App Service, and tested it in the cloud.

You're confident that you can recommend migrating your SpringBoot Java application code to Azure.

Learn how Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging in [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs/?WT.mc_id=java-10785-ropreddy) article.

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete the resource group from portal, or by running the following command in the Cloud Shell:

```bash
az group delete --name <your resource group name> --yes
```

This command may take a minute to run.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's important that you de-provision the Azure resources used in this module to avoid accruing unwanted charges.
