<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly summarize the key skill this unit will teach

    Heading: none

    Example: "Organizations often have multiple storage accounts to let them implement different sets of requirements."

TODO: add your topic sentences(s)
After enabling a registration campaign for Microsoft Authenticator, administrators want to validate the new sign-in experience works as expected before running the campaign production. 



<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that will be solved by the content in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "In the shoe-company scenario, we will use a Twitter trigger to launch our app when tweets containing our product name are available."
-->
TODO: add your scenario sub-task
You want to apply the new policy to a test user and confirm Microsoft Authenticator is the new default sign-in method. 

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what's covered in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will learn the policy factors that are controlled by a storage account so you can decide how many accounts you need."
-->
TODO: write your prose table-of-contents
You'll create a new user account in Azure AD and enable it for Microsoft Authenticator. Then you'll sign in, perform MFA, and set up Microsoft Authenticator. After you confirm the new user account has Microsoft Authenticator as the new default sign-in method, you will apply the policy to the remote employees group. 

<!-- 4. Visual element (highly recommended) ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Visual element, like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote. Ideally, you'll provide an image that illustrates the customer problem the unit will solve; it can use the scenario to do this or stay generic (i.e. not address the scenario).

    Heading: none
-->
TODO: add a visual element

<!-- 5. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to perform this sub-task.

    Structure: Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. 1-3 paragraphs of text
        3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote.

      - Perform MFA as a test user 
      - Confirm Microsoft Authenticator is the new default sign-in method
