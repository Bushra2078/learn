<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: orient the learner to the area covered in this module

    Heading: none

    Example: "Azure Logic Apps let you automate your business processes and run them in the cloud."

    Recommended: visual like an image, table, list, etc. that supports the topic sentence(s)

-->
You can improve sign-in security by helping users to set up Microsoft Authenticator whenever they sign in.


<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts

    Heading: "## Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company on the marketing team. You're launching a new basketball shoe created by a celebrity athlete. Previous launches resulted in a social media frenzy as people shared stories and photos of themselves wearing their new shoes. The marketing team wants to monitor hundreds of social media sites, blogs, and websites to determine consumer reaction. There will be more data than you can process manually. You would like a cloud-hosted system that automates monitoring, text analytics, database storage, and email notifications."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario, use the image markdown extension (https://review.learn.microsoft.com/help/contribute/markdown-reference?branch=main#images)

    Optional: a "scenario video" that visualizes the scenario

## Example scenario

You monitor security compliance for a manufacturer that uses Microsoft 365. In response to recent supply-chain attacks, senior leadership wants to strengthen sign-in security for the company. 

The company already requires MFA, but many remote employees use either a voice call or an SMS code for additional authentication after they sign-in with their username and password. With budgets already set for this year, leadership wants a low-cost solution that helps their remote employees switch to more secure authentication and gradually move to passwordless sign-in. 
   
You need to research the security differences between available authentication options and determine a way to help remote employees switch. Then you'll want to prepare your Microsoft 365 environment and validate the experience for users.

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Here, you'll create a business workflow using Azure Logic Apps to automate the processing of tweets:
                * **Launch**: when a new tweet is available
                * **Process**: determine if the sentiment of the tweet is positive or negative
                * **Route**: branch based on the sentiment score"

 -->
## What will we be doing?
You'll review the relative security strength of different authentication methods and prepare your environment by creating a policy for remote employees to set up Microsoft Authenticator. Then you'll create a test user and walk through the setup process on a phone. 

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: This is a restatement of the module title into a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to create workflows which route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its built-in connectors."

 -->
## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to explain why Microsoft Authenticator provides better security than authentication methods like SMS or voice call, enable users to register Microsoft Authenticator when they sign in, and confirm it's their default sign-in method.
