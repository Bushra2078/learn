    - content: "Automates Visual Studio build validation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "ARM templates are not part of Visual Studio or it's build validation workflow."
    - content: "Automates app distribution through PowerShell" 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While ARM templates are executed through PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt, they do not control app distribution."
  - content: "When setting up Azure services and using ARM templates, which of the following do you need to pay special attention too?"
    choices:
    - content: "Service availability by location"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes, Azure service availability varies by region.  Refer to the Products available by region to learn which services are available by region.  There may be extra fees associated with inter-region, inter-service transactions."

  - content: "What approach is the most efficient means to create assets in Unity that connect to ADT?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create one asset in the Scene and copy-paste it so that all parameters are transferred to the copy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although this can be a quick approach to duplicate assets, it's still a manual approach and requires manual manipulation after to copy-paste."
    - content: "Develop a ScriptableObject to create assets at runtime based on a core Prefab"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ScriptableObjects are the quickest way to create many assets, repeatedly.  ScriptableObjects use scripts to create assets based on a core Prefab and can be created and configured in mass, at runtime."
    - content: "Drag and drop Prefab assets in the Scene" 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a quick way to add assets to a Unity Scene, each will require manual configuration after dropping into the scene"
  - content: "True or false: A device simulator is always required for all Digital Twins to connect assets to ADT."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A device simulator isn't required for all Digital Twins to connect assets to ADT.  Often, when developers are creating digital representations of physical assets or processes, they have access to rich IoT, enterprise, and other data sources relevant to their Digital Twins."
