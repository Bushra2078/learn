Visualizing assets in an immersive setting permits users to experience the right data in the right context, at the right time.  Adding connectivity of your assets to operations data makes your assets more intelligent and reflective of physical assets or processes.  

## Example scenario

In this scenario, each of the wind turbines in your wind farm needs to be connected to a simulated data stream representing real-world IoT data feeds. You would like each turbine UI panel to react to events, display operational information, and have the map focus on the selected turbine in the scene.

## What will we be doing?

In this unit, you'll connect your wind turbines to a stream of Azure Digital Twins (ADT) data for visualization and interaction on the HoloLens 2.  This is the true power of the Digital Twins service.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to connect real-world operating data to digital assets (live or historic IoT data), which allows you to:

- Visualize operating conditions
- Identify anomalies in performance or equipment health / integrity
- Determine trends and patterns in data over time
- Simulate future conditions or operations situations
