Visualizing assets in an immersive setting permits users to experience the right data in the right context, at the right time.  Adding connectivity of your assets to operations data makes your assets more intelligent and reflective of physical assets or processes.  When real-world operating data is connected to digital assets (live or historic IoT data), users can:

- Visualize operating conditions
- Identify anomalies in performance or equipment health / integrity
- Determine trends and patterns in data over time
- Simulate future conditions or operations situations

In this unit, you'll connect your wind turbines to a stream of Azure Digital Twins (ADT) data for visualization and interaction on the HoloLens 2.  This is the true power of the Digital Twins service.
