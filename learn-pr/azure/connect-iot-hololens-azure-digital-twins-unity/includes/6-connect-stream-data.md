An Azure SignalR service has been exposed as part of the ARM template that you deployed. This service and associated setup enables you to connect to ADT.  A data pipeline has been created to retrieve data from ADT, which is abstracted from the client app that will be running on HoloLens 2.

## SignalR overview

Azure SignalR Service simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications over HTTP. This real-time functionality allows the service to push content updates to connected clients, such as a single page web or mobile application. As a result, clients are updated without the need to poll the server or submit new HTTP requests for updates.  Any scenario that requires pushing data from server to client in real time, can use Azure SignalR Service.  Traditional real-time features that often require polling from a server, can also use Azure SignalR Service.

The Azure SignalR Service can be easily integrated with other Azure services, opening up other possible scenarios. For example, an Azure Function can use the REST API to push notifications into the Azure SignalR Service, which then pushes data to connected clients in real time. Used together with IoT Hub, the Azure SignalR Service can enable real time sensor data to be transmitted to connected clients to support real time monitoring scenarios.

Real-time scenarios often come with high-frequency data flows and large quantities of concurrent connections between the client and server. They require non-trivial infrastructure setup to get the functionality up and running at scale. Doing this at scale is extremely difficult and usually requires application specific logic at various network layers.  The Azure SignalR Service handles those issues, so you can focus on the application logic that delivers real-time connected experiences. You can scale real-time functionality dynamically while paying only for what you use. The service also inherits SignalR’s capabilities for persistent connections over various transports.

Azure SignalR Service has been used in a wide variety of industries, for any application type that requires real-time content updates. We list some examples that are good to use Azure SignalR Service:

- **High frequency data updates:** gaming, voting, polling, auction.
- **Dashboards and monitoring:** company dashboard, financial market data, instant sales update, multi-player game leader board, and IoT monitoring.
- **Real-time location on map:** logistic tracking, delivery status tracking, transportation status updates, GPS apps.
- **Real time targeted ads:** personalized real-time push ads and offers, interactive ads.
- **Collaborative apps:** co-authoring, whiteboard apps and team meeting software.
- **Push notifications:** social network, email, game, travel alert.
- **Real-time broadcasting:** live audio/video broadcasting, live captioning, translating, events/news broadcasting.
- **IoT and connected devices:** real-time IoT metrics, remote control, real-time status, and location tracking.
- **Automation:** real-time trigger from upstream events.

For your wind turbine use case, the communication layer between the ADT wind turbine data and HoloLens 2 uses the Azure SignalR service and a SignalR client embedded in the HoloLens 2 app.

To expose the data to your client app via ADT, you need to connect to the Azure SignalR service. The HoloLens 2 app that you're building implements a SignalR client to connect to the SignalR service.  Establishing communication between the SignalR client and the Azure SignalR service requires the client to invoke the **negotiate** function in the SignalR service.

Configure your **DeviceSimulator** with your ADT connection parameters and authentication details captured in the previous exercise.  

## Get app credentials

1. Open **DeviceSimulator.sln** in Visual Studio and configure the DeviceSimulator with the Host name for the ADT resource type created by the ARM template
2. Open the **Azure_config_settings.txt** text file that you created in the last exercise containing the key Azure ADT configuration parameters, using a text editor.  Alternatively, if your PowerShell session remains active, look for the output from your **get-content** command.
3. From the **Azure_config_settings.txt** file or from the output of your **get-content** command in PowerShell, locate the key/value pair for the **adtHostName** key and copy the value.  It should look something similar to: 

    ```console
    https://myprojadtxxxxxxxxxx.api.eus.digitaltwins.azure.net
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="../media/query-azure-deployment-to-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command-line interface running the get-content command prompt." lightbox="../media/query-azure-deployment-to-file.png":::

4. In your Visual Studio **DeviceSimulator** solution, open the **AzureIoTHub.cs** file in the editor by double-clicking the file from the Solution Explorer pane, typically found on the right-hand side of the application screen.  Paste the value for your **adtHostName** key/pair copied from Step 2 above into the **adtInstanceUrl** string variable.

## Configure the DeviceSimulator with the Primary connection string for the IoT Hub created by the ARM template

1. From the **Azure_config_settings.txt** file or from the output of your **get-content** command in PowerShell, locate the key/value pair for the **connectionString** key and copy the value.  It should look something similar to: 

    ```console
    HostName=myprojHubxxxxxxxxxx.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey= xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx”
    ```

2. In your Visual Studio **DeviceSimulator** solution, open the **AzureIoTHub.cs** file in the editor and paste your connectionString value copied from Step 1 above into the **iotHubConnectionString** string variable.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/host-name-cs-expanded.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Device Simulator solution open in Visual Studio. The Azure IoT Hub dot cs file is open and iot hub connection string value is added." lightbox="../media/host-name-cs.png":::

## Configure the DeviceSimulator with the authentication keys created by the ARM template 

1. Open the **AppCredentials.txt** text file that you created in the previous exercise.  
2. In your Visual Studio **DeviceSimulator** solution, open the **PropUpdater.cs** file in the editor.  Copy and paste the Globally Unique IDs (GUIDs) from your text file to the .cs file based on the following mappings from the .cs variables to the JSON data output in your text file:

    | AppCredentials.txt | PropUpdater.cs |
    |---|---|
    | appId | clientId |
    | password | clientSecret |
    | tenant | tenantId |

    :::image type="content" source="../media/prop-updater-expanded.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Device Simulator solution in Visual Studio. The prop updater dot cs file is open and client, secret, and tenant I D values are added." lightbox="../media/prop-updater.png":::

3. Save your work in Visual Studio by selecting **File > Save All**

Connect your ADT Prefab in Unity to the ADT so that you can receive simulated telemetry data from the DeviceSimulator.

## Add the ADT Connection Prefab Asset to your Unity Scene and configure

1. Return to your Unity project
2. Select the **ADTConnection** game object in the Hierarchy.  If it’s missing from your hierarchy, drag the **Assets > ADTPrefabs > ADTConnection** Prefab asset to your **Scene** hierarchy

    :::image type="content" source="../media/hierarchy-adt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Unity Hierarchy with the main scene highlighted.":::

3. Open the text file that you created in the last exercise containing the key Azure ADT configuration parameters you **Azure_config_settings.txt** using a text editor.  Alternatively, if your PowerShell session remains active, look for the output from your **get-content** command.
4. From the **Azure_config_settings.txt** file or from the output of your **get-content** command in PowerShell, locate the key/value pair for the **signalRNegotiatePath** key and copy the value.  It should look something similar to 

    ```console
    https://myprojfuncappxxxxxxxxxx.azurewebsites.net/api/negotiate
    ```

5. Add this value to the **Url** parameter under the **ADT Data Handler (Script)** Component with the **Function Url** obtained in Step 3.  Include everything in the Url up to and including ```…/api```.  Don't include the last backslash nor the word “negotiate”.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/adt-function-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Unity editor with the ADT connection prefab selected and the ADT data handler script added. Main scene is in play mode and shows the terrain prefab.":::

7. **Save** the scene

Now that the Azure services are set up and the appropriate pointers are within your Unity Scene, you'll create a User Interface to visualize the operations data.
