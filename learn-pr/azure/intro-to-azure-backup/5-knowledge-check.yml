### General guidance (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)
###  - Questions are complete sentences ending with a question mark
###  - No true/false questions
###  - 3 answers per question
###  - All answers about the same length
###  - Numeric answers listed in sorted order
###  - No "All of the above" and/or "None of the above" as answer choices
###  - No "Not" or "Except" in questions
###  - No second person ("you") in the questions or answers
###  - Provide a meaningful explanation for both correct and incorrect answers
###
### Question content requirements:
###  - Write 5 questions
###  - Questions 1,2 must test this Learning Objective: "Describe how <attributes> of <product> work to <solve problem>"
###      Guidance: These two questions can be short, no need for a long scenario to analyze. Test if they understand how the product works.
###      Example: "What differentiates an action from a control action in an Azure Logic App?"
###  - Questions 3,4,5 must test this Learning Objective: "Evaluate whether <product> is appropriate to <general product use case>"
###      Guidance: Use scenario questions that ask the learner to analyze a situation with the "when to use" criteria presented in the module.
###      Example: "Suppose you work for a financial company. You're building a system to let your brokers trade financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you'll have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?"

quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which tier allows for quick restore operations on a backup?"
    choices:
    - content: "Snapshot Tier"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The snapshots of the VM/ Azure Files/ Azure Blobs/etc. are retained in the customer’s subscription itself in a specified resource group. This ensure restores are quick, since the backup/snapshot is available locally to the customer."
    - content: "Standard Tier"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Vault-Standard tier is an online storage tier that enables you to store an isolated copy of backup data in a Microsoft-managed tenant, thus creating an extra layer of protection."
    - content: "Archive Tier"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In most cases, the older backup data is rarely accessed and is only stored for compliance needs. This data is stored in the archive tier."
  - content: "What tool can you use to manage backups spanning multiple workload types, vaults, subscriptions, regions, and Azure Lighthouse tenants"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Monitor is a service for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments."
    - content: "System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: DPM is used on-premises for data backup. While you can back up data that is backed up by DPM, it doesn't support this scenario."
    - content: "Backup Center"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use Backup center to efficiently manage backups spanning multiple workload types, vaults, subscriptions, regions, and Azure Lighthouse tenants."
  - content: "What must be present before you can back up an entire VM or content on an Azure VM?"
    choices:
    - content: "Backup extensions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Backup is able to back up entire Windows and Linux VMs, using backup extensions."
    - content: "Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MABS is used for backing up on-premises Windows machines."
    - content: "Recovery point objective policies in an Azure vault."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Recovery point objective (RPO), is concerned with the amount of time it takes for recovery operations."
