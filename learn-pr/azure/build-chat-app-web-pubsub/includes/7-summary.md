In this module, you accomplished the following objectives to build and manage a real-time chat app:

- Created a Web PubSub instance
- Created and configure a Static Web App with backend Function APIs from code maintained in a GitHub repo
- Configured an event handler in Web PubSub to route events and messages to the app
- Tested your chat app
- Learned about continuous delivery (CD), to automatically building and deploying code changes to Azure from the GitHub repo

## Clean up

The sandbox automatically cleans up your resources when you're finished with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources that you leave running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
