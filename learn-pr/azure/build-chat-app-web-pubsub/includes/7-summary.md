In this module, you accomplished the following objectives to build and manage a real-time chat app:

- Created a Web PubSub instance
- Created and configure a Static Web App with backend Function APIs from code maintained in a GitHub repo
- Configured an event handler in Web PubSub to route events and messages to the app
- Tested your chat app
- Learned about continuous delivery (CD), to automatically building and deploying code changes to Azure from the GitHub repo
