Azure Web PubSub service helps you build real-time messaging web applications based on WebSocket connections. Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository. 

In this module, you'll learn how to use Web PubSub service, Azure Functions, and Static Web Apps to build a serverless, real-time chat room messaging application. When you change the code and commit the changes, GitHub Actions builds and deploy the changes to Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll accomplish the following objectives to build and manage a real-time chat app:

- Create a Web PubSub instance
- Create and configure a Static Web App with backend Function APIs from code maintained in a GitHub repo
- Configure an event handler in Web PubSub to route events and messages to the app
- Test your chat app
- Implement continuous delivery (CD), automatically building and deploying code changes to Azure from a GitHub repo

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
