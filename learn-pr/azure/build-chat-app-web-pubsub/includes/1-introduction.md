Azure Web PubSub service helps you build real-time messaging web applications based on WebSocket connections. Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository. 

In this module, you'll learn how to use Azure Web PubSub, Static Web Apps, and Functions APIs to build a serverless, real-time chat room messaging application. You'll deploy the static web app from code maintained in a GitHub repo.
