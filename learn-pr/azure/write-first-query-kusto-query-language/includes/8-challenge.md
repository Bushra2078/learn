Recall that in the storm events example, we've narrowed down events by time range, keywords, and values in a particular column. We've also sorted results and projected specific columns.

Now it's your turn to try writing a query from scratch.

Use the table we've been exploring up until now, *StormEvents*, to answer the following question:

In the month of April 2007, what were the top five damage-causing storm types in the state of Virginia? In this case, damage refers to both property and crop damage.

Use the operators `where`, `project`, and `top`.
