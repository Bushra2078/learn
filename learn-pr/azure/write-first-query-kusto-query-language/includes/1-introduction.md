Kusto Query Language (KQL) lets you explore your data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, and create statistical models. 

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a data analyst with a passion for meteorological data. You want to use the Kusto Query Language to explore a dataset for answers to basic questions about the kinds and locations of storms in the US.

## What will we be doing?

You'll write simple queries in Kusto Query Language (KQL) to explore and gain insights from a sample dataset. You'll learn how to:

- Return a specific number or rows by using the `take` operator
- Select columns to return by using the `project` operator
- Filter data by using the `where` operator
- Reorder returned data by using the `sort` operator
- Build a query by using these operators

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to write a query with the most commonly used operators count, take, project, where, and sort.
