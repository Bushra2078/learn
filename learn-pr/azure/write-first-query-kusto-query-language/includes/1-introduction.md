Kusto Query Language (KQL) lets you explore your data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, and create statistical modeling. 

TODO: add a visual element

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a data analyst with a passion for meteorological data. You want to use KQL to explore and prepare a dataset that will enable you to answer basic questions about the kinds and locations of storms in the US.

## What will we be doing?

You'll write simple queries in Kusto Query Language (KQL) to explore and gain insights from a sample dataset. You'll learn how to:

- Return a specific number or rows by using the `take` operator
- Select columns to return by using the `project` operator
- Filter data by using the `where` operator
- Count instances by using the `count` operator
- Reorder returned data by using the `sort` operator
- Build a query by using those five operators

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to write a KQL query with the most commonly used operators take, project, count, where, and sort.

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: This is a restatement of the module title into a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to create workflows which route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its built-in connectors."
