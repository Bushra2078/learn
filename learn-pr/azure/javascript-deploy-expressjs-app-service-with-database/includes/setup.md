In this unit, understand the sample application and Visual Studio code extensions.

## Required development tools

To develop an Express.js app, the following tools are used in this module:

* Node.js
* Visual Studio Code
* GitHub sample repository

## Express.js local development

The GitHub repository, for all Express.js apps in this Learn path, is provided for you. You need bring the sample repository from GitHub to your local computer then use the subdirectory `3-Add-cosmosdb-mongodb` for this module. 

You can choose to:

* Fork and clone the sample app GitHub repository.
* Download the zipped repository from GitHub.

Either method works, and one of the methods should be familiar to you already. The sample app includes the typical Express.js files along with some Visual Studio Code files to improve the developer experience.

## Visual Studio Code extensions

To create and manage Azure resources and your local MongoDB database, install Visual Studio Code extensions. These are not the only ways to manage Azure or MongoDB but they are conveniently located inside the development environment so you don't need to use other tools.
