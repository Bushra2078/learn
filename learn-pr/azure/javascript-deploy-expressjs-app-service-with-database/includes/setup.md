In this section, you need to setup the web app. 

## Use the Learn sandbox

This module uses the Learn sandbox with a *four-hour subscription*. The subscription and its resources are deleted after that time.  

With the Learn sandbox, you can create and use resources without creating your own subscription with a credit card. The subscription and resource group are already created for you. As part of the sandbox, you use that subscription to create the resources necessary to deploy your web app.


## Create resources from Visual Studio Code

In order to use Visual Studio Code with Azure, you need to:

* Install Azure extensions
* Sign in to Azure 

## Automate resource creation

This module requires two Azure resources before you begin:

* App Service
* Application Insights connected to the App Service

If you have these resources available, you can skip that part of the next exercise. If you don't have those resources available, you will need to create them. If you need to create them, that process is provided in the next exercise.
