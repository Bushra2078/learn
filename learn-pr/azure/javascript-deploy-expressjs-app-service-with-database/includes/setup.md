This module is a continuation of the JavaScript on Azure path. Some local and remote setup is required to use the sample app at this point in the path.

## Express.js local and remote development

The sample app is provided for you. You need to fork the GitHub repository, then clone your fork to bring a copy of the sample application to your local computer. 

## Learn sandbox 

The Learn sandbox allows you to create and use Azure resources with no cost to you and without any credit card. The Learn sandbox is contained in a separate tenant. Once you have access to that tenant, you can create the Azure resources used in this module. 

## Visual Studio Code extensions

To create and manage those Azure resources, install Visual Studio Code extensions. This allows you to manage those resources from within Visual Studio Code. 

## Azure App Service

This module setup requires the following services:

* App Service
* Monitor (Application Insights)

A script is provided for you to create those resources. If you need to learn what those resources are and how they are used and created in Visual Studio Code, complete the **[Deploy Express.js to Azure App Service](/learn/modules/javascript-deploy-expressjs-app-service/)** module then return to this module.
