In this Learn module, you'll integrate a web app with MongoDB and deploy to Azure. Azure CosmosDB API for MongoDB provides a MongoDB compatible layer. You can use your favorite npm client packages for MongoDB and store your data on Azure.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a web developer or DevOps engineer who needs to deploy a data web app to Azure. You're an experienced developer, but you're new to Azure.

You'll learn how to deploy and configure the Azure database resource you need to deploy a data web app. The data web app is a rental property app used by a company to help its employees relocate when needed. The app displays rental properties and property information.

:::image type="content" source="../media/rental-app-website-browser.png" alt-text="Web browser that shows the main listings of a rental app.":::

The rental property data web app is built with Express.js. The user interface is created with simple JavaScript and served from the Express.js server. 

The entire source code is provided as part of this module. You won't be required to change the code.

## What will you be doing?

You'll deploy an Express.js app which stores data in Cosmos DB for the MongoDB API, then configure the Azure App Service and deploy to Azure:

- Use the free Learn sandbox subscription - no credit card needed.
- Set up local development environment.
- Run the sample application on your local computer with local database.
- Create Azure Cosmos DB resource.
- Configure the Azure App Service to connect to your CosmosDB database.
- Deploy the Express.js app from your local computer with Visual Studio Code.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create and integrate a MongoDB database, using Cosmos DB API for MongoDB, into an Express.js web app and deploy to your own App Service resource.
