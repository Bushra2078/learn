In this Learn module, you'll deploy an Express.js (Node.js) data web app to Azure App Service from Visual Studio Code.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a web developer or DevOps engineer who needs to deploy a data web app to Azure. You're an experienced developer, but you're new to Azure.

You'll learn how to deploy and configure the Azure database resource you need to deploy a data web app. The data web app is a rental property app used by a company to help its employees relocate when needed. The app displays rental properties and property information.

The rental property data web app is built with Express.js. The user interface is created with simple JavaScript and served from the Express.js server. 

The entire source code is provided as part of this module. You won't be required to change the code.

## What will you be doing?

You'll deploy an Express.js app which stores data in Cosmos DB for the MongoDB API, then configure the Azure App Service and deploy to Azure:

- Use the free Learn sandbox subscription and resource group.
- Create a Cosmos DB database with Visual Studio Code
- Use the local emulator for Cosmos DB
- Upload JSON data into the database with Visual Studio Code
- Deploy the data web app from your local computer with Visual Studio Code.
- Analyze the database.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to deploy an Express.js data web app on your own App Service resource and know that it's running as expected.
