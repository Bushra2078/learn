In this unit, you'll use the Azure portal to verify your Event Hub is working according to expectations. You'll also test how Event Hub messaging works when it's temporarily unavailable, and use Event Hubs metrics to check the performance of your Event Hub.

## View Event Hub activity

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you activated the sandbox with.

1. Find your Event Hub using the Search bar, and open it as we did in the previous exercise.

1. On the Overview page, view the message counts.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal displaying the Event Hub namespace with message counts.](../media/6-view-messages.png)

1. The SimpleSend and EventProcessorSample applications are configured to send/receive 100 messages. You'll see that the Event Hub has processed 100 messages from the SimpleSend application and has transmitted 100 messages to the EventProcessorSample application.

## Test Event Hub resilience

Perform the following steps to see what happens when an application sends messages to an Event Hub while it's temporarily unavailable.

1. Resend messages to the Event Hub using the SimpleSend application. Run the following command in Cloud Shell.

    ```azurecli
    cd ~
    cd azure-event-hubs/samples/Java/Basic/SimpleSend
    java -jar ./target/simplesend-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    ```

1. When you see **Send Complete**, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Return to the Azure portal. On the **Overview** page of your **Event Hubs Namespace** pane, select your Event Hub from the list at the bottom. This will show details specific to the Event Hub. You can also get to this pane with the **Event Hubs** entry from the namespace page. The **Event Hubs Instance** pane appears.

1. In the left menu pane, under **Settings**, select **Properties**. The **Properties** pane appears for your Event Hubs Instance.

1. Under **EVENT HUB STATUS**, select **Disabled**, and in the top menu bar, select **Save changes**.

    ![Disable Event Hub.](../media/7-disable-event-hub.png)

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >Wait for a minimum of five minutes before proceeding.

1. Select **Active** under **EVENT HUB STATUS** to re-enable your Event Hub, and in the top menu bar, select **Save changes**.

1. In Cloud Shell, rerun the EventProcessorSample application to receive messages. Run the following command.

    ```azurecli
    cd ~
    cd azure-event-hubs/samples/Java/Basic/EventProcessorSample
    java -jar ./target/eventprocessorsample-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    ```

1. When messages stop being appearing on the console, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Back in the Azure portal, go back to your Event Hub Namespace. If you're still on the Event Hub page, you can use the breadcrumb on the top of the screen to go backwards. Or you can search for the namespace, and select it.

1. In the middle menu pane, under **Monitoring**, select **Metrics**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Event Hub Metrics with number of incoming and outgoing messages displayed.](../media/7-event-hub-metrics.png)

1. From the **Metric** dropdown list, select **Incoming Messages**, and in the taskbar, select **Add metric**.

1. From the **Metric** dropdown list, select **Outgoing Messages**, and in the taskbar, select **Add metric**.

1. At the top right of the chart, select **Last 24 hours (Automatic)**, and in the dialog box that appears, change the time period to **Last 30 minutes** to expand the data graph. Select **Apply**.

You'll see that though the messages were sent before the Event Hub was taken offline for a period, all 100 messages were successfully transmitted.

## Summary

In this unit, you used the Event Hubs metrics to test that your Event Hub is successfully processing the sending and receiving messages.
