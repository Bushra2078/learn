Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Kubernetes would be a good choice as a container orchestration platform for your business. We looked at several features that enhance the AKS Kubernetes offering. We saw how these features could help you decide if Kubernetes is a good fit for new projects, or convince you to move to Kubernetes to orchestrate current container deployments.

You saw how Kubernetes provides for:

- The deployment of containers

- Self-healing of containers

- Dynamically scaling container count up or down

- Automated rolling updates and rollbacks of containers

- Management of storage

- Management of network traffic

- The store and manage sensitive information such as usernames and passwords

You were looking for a container orchestration platform to deploy and manage your drone tracking solution into new customer regions. Kubernetes allows you to manage your container environment and makes it simple to develop, deploy, and manage containerized applications.
