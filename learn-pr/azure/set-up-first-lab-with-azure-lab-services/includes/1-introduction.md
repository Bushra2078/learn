Azure Lab Services lets you create labs whose infrastructure is managed by Azure. The service itself handles all the infrastructure management, from spinning up VMs to handling errors and scaling the infrastructure. The service provides a virtual desktop environment with a virtual machine behind it. You can use Azure Lab Services for classes such as cybersecurity, machine learning, programming, network and systems administration, data sciences, and media and the arts. You can also use the service for various non-classroom scenarios such as Hackathons.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for an educational institution. You deliver classes on cybersecurity and data sciences software. Also, you provide practice environments after each class, where students develop and test code to consolidate their learning. Both classes and practice environments are currently hosted in your on-premises classrooms. You want to migrate these systems into the cloud.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll configure a lab and connect to it so you can install required classroom software. From the lab plan, you'll create a lab using a template virtual machine.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create a lab plan and a lab by using Azure Lab Services.
