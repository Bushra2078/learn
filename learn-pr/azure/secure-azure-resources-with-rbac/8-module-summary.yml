### YamlMime:ModuleUnit
# YML code for unit
uid: learn.secure-azure-resources-with-rbac.8-module-summary
# `uid`s are manually created by the writer and should follow the format <repo>.<module-short-name>.<unit-short-name>. Keep it easy on yourself and keep the module-short-name the same as the unit YAML file name.
metadata:
# Search engine metadata
  title: Module Summary
  description: Module Summary
  displayType: one-column
  # Text-only units use the one-column option, which drives a single-column layout, similar to a normal article, with no interactive component.
title: Module Summary
# `title` appears in the header, ToC, and breadcrumbs
durationInMinutes: 11
# `durationInMinutes` is manually created by the writer
# Even though there is only one markdown (MD) file and this is a text-only unit, keep the Markdown separate in the includes folder so that viewing the source content is a consistent experience.
