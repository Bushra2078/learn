## Motivation

Access management for cloud resources is a critical function for any organization that is using the cloud. Role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and where they have access to.

RBAC is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management of resources in Azure.

As an example, suppose you work for First Up Consultants, which is an engineering firm that specializes in circuit and electrical design. They have moved their workloads and assets to Azure to make collaboration easier across several offices and other companies. You work in the IT department at First Up Consultants where you are responsible for keeping the company's assets secure, but still allowing users to access the resources they need for their job. You've heard that RBAC can help you manage resources in Azure.

In this module, you will learn how to use RBAC to manage access to resources in Azure.
