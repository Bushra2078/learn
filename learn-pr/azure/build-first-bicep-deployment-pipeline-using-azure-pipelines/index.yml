title: Build your first Bicep deployment pipeline by using Azure Pipelines
summary: |
  Build a basic deployment pipeline for Bicep code. Use a service connection to securely identify your pipeline to Azure. Configure when the pipeline runs by using triggers.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
    - Automate Bicep deployments by using a pipeline in Azure Pipelines
    - Configure a service connection to authenticate a pipeline to Azure
    - Select an appropriate pipeline trigger and set of tasks for a Bicep deployment
prerequisites: |
  You should be familiar with:

  - Creating and deploying basic Bicep files.
  - Azure, including the Azure portal, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.
