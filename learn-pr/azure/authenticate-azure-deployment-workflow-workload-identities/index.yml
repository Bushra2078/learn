title: Authenticate your Azure deployment workflow by using workload identities
summary: |
  Workload identities enable your deployment workflows to authenticate securely with Azure without you managing any passwords, keys, or secrets.
  In this module, you'll learn what workload identities are, how they work, and how to create them.
  You'll also learn how to grant them permission to your Azure resources so that your pipelines can deploy your Bicep files.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  - Explain what a workload identity is, how it works, and how it compares to a service principal and managed identity
  - Create a workload identity and link it to a GitHub Actions deployment workflow
  - Configure the appropriate authorization for a workload identity to deploy Azure resources
prerequisites: |
  You should be familiar with:
  - Creating and deploying basic Bicep templates.
  - Azure, including the Azure portal, subscriptions, resource groups, and resource definitions.

  To follow along with the exercises in the module, you'll need:
  - An Azure account, with the ability to create resource groups and to create Azure Active Directory applications and service principals.
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), installed locally.  
  - The [Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep), installed locally.
