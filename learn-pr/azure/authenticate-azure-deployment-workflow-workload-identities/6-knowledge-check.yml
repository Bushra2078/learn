  questions:
  - content: Which of these statements about workload identities is true?
    choices:
    - content: When you use workload identities, you must carefully manage their secrets.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Federated credentials enable deployment workflows to securely authenticate to Azure Active Directory without you storing any secrets.
    - content: Workload identities use federated credentials to authenticate.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Federated credentials enable deployment workflows to securely authenticate to Azure Active Directory without you storing any secrets.
    - content: Workload identities must be created by using the Azure portal.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Workload identities and federated credentials can be created by using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.
  - content: You need to create a deployment workflow that deploys your infrastructure to three environments - development, test, and production. Each environment is in a dedicated resource group in three different subscriptions. What should you do?
    choices:
    - content: Create a single workload identity and grant it access to the tenant root management group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Although this will work, it's not a good practice to use a single workload identity for all of your environments. Additionally, granting access to your tenant root management group will allow the workload identity to modify resources anywhere in your Azure environment, which is unnecessarily permissive.
    - content: Create a single workload identity and grant it access to each of the resource groups in the three subscriptions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Although this will work, it's not good practice to use a single workload identity for all of your environments. At the very least, you should separate production and non-production environments by using two workload identities, but a dedicated workload identity for each environment is ideal.
    - content: Create three workload identities, one per environment, and grant each access to a single resource group in a single subscription.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. When you work with multiple environments, it's best to use dedicated workload identities for each environment so that your pipeline can't accidentally change anything in another environment.
  - content: You're creating a workload identity to run a pipeline. The pipeline deploys a Bicep file that creates a single storage account. Which of the following options has the least privileged access that you need for your pipeline?
    choices:
    - content: |
        **Role definition:** Contributor<br />
        **Scope:** Subscription
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Contributor role is a good one to use. However, you should avoid granting it over the subscription scope unless you need to. In this case, you don't.
    - content: |
        **Role definition:** Contributor<br />
        **Scope:** Resource group
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The Contributor role is a good one to use. Additionally, it's a good practice to grant it over the resource group, which is all that this pipeline needs.
    - content: |
        **Role definition:** Owner<br />
        **Scope:** Resource group
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This role assignment is too permissive. You should avoid granting the Owner role unless it's required. In this example, it's not.
