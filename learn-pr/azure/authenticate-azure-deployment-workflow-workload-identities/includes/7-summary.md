You're planning your first deployment workflow for your toy company. Before you started building it, you needed to plan how the workflow would securely identify itself to Azure.

In this module, you learned what service principals are and why you use them in a deployment workflow. You also learned about the two types of credentials that you can use with a service principal (certificates and keys), and that managed identities don't require you to work with credentials. Then, you learned how to grant a service principal access to your Azure environment by using the principle of least privilege.

By using service principals, you can start to build deployment workflows that support the automation of your infrastructure. Service principals enable you to create tightly scoped identities that represent a single workflow, and you can grant them access to do exactly what they need to do.
