In this module, you explored the native Azure monitoring tools and gained a better understanding of how everything fits together from a tooling perspective. You then deployed 2 virtual machines and a Log Analytics workspace. From there, you connected both virtual machines and onboarded them to Virtual Machine Insights.

Next, you explored log queries, which are a great way to drill deeper into log data generated by Azure resources. You learned how to take simple queries and add additional operators that help filter data in a meaningful way. From there, you experimented with a query in the query pane surrounding logical disk space consumed and analyzed the results. Afterward, you tweaked the existing query and added a few different components to turn it into a log alert for disk space under a 10% threshold.

By learning about Azure Monitor Logs and Virtual Machine Insights, you now have a better understanding on how to help your firm out as they continue to provision resources in Azure.
