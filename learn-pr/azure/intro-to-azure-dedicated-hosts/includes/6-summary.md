In this module, we learned about Azure Dedicated Hosts. Dedicated hosts enables you create and manage private virtual machine environments on a single-tenant physical host. This ensures isolation from other customers, greater control of maintenance schedules, and provides increased security at the hardware level.

You looked at using Azure Dedicated Hosts for your IT organization to provide cloud-based services to your customers when there are requests for a more private and controlled infrastructure. To make the process easier, you saw how using the dedicated host service can allocate dedicated hardware resources to a customer's Azure environment, ensuring that their virtual machines remain isolated from others. Without Azure Dedicated Hosts, customers would have to rely on shared hosting environments, which might not provide the desired level of control and privacy. With Azure Dedicated Hosts, you can streamline the process of setting up private environments in the cloud, which can have a significant business impact by reducing the time and effort required to create secure and isolated local virtual machine environments.
