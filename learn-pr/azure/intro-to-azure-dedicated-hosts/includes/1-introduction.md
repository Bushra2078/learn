Suppose you work for an IT organization that provides cloud-based services to a wide range of customers. One of the customers wants to migrate their local infrastructure to the cloud. The customer emphasized the importance of having a completely private environment. They don't want their virtual machines to run on hosts that other customers are using due to their data security requirements in their organization. Additionally, theyâ€™ve requested a higher degree of control over the locations of VMs on said hosts to further tailor their infrastructure to their specific requirements.
 
- You will need to ensure the hosts are configured correctly.
- The administration experience should be similar to standard Azure VM deployments.
- All data must remain secure and private within the host environment.

To fulfill these requirements, you decide to use Azure Dedicated Hosts. With Azure Dedicated Hosts, you can allocate dedicated physical servers to host your customer's virtual machines for improved performance, control, and data isolation.
