  questions:
  - content: "What are the extra configuration layers required to run VMs on a dedicated host? "
    choices:
    - content: "Host reservations, Hosts, Size sets, Instances"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Host reservations and Size sets don't exist"
    - content: "Host groups, Scale reservations, Size families, Cores"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scale reservations don't exist. Cores are a layer of standard virtual machines."
    - content: "Host groups, Hosts, Size families, Instances"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All these layers are required to run a virtual machine on a dedicated host."
  - content: "How do dedicated hosts compare to reserved instances?"
    choices:
    - content: "They're the same feature"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Reserved instances are a feature to reserve multi-tenant VMs and save money on scalable workloads."
    - content: "Reserved instances functionality is included in dedicated hosts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With Dedicated hosts you reserve the whole host server. There's no need to reserve VM space on said host."
    - content: "Reserved instances are a different type of dedicated host"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Reserved instances are a feature to reserve multi-tenant VMs and save money on scalable workloads. They don't guarantee a specific host or present the same feature set as dedicated hosts. "  
  - content: "How many VMs can run on a single dedicated host?"
    choices:
    - content: "As many as you can fit"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. As long as the sum of the sizes is less than the host's resources, you can run as many VMs as you want."
    - content: "As many as you want as long as they're identical sizes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can mix as many sizes as you want as long as they're in the same size family and the sum of the sizes is less than the host's resources."
    - content: "A dedicated host is a single VM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a single size can encompass an entire host's resources, you can run as many smaller sizes as you can fit within the host's resources."
