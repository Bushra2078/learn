  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You need to iterate through an array of items to find one that matches a certain criteria.  Which is the best iteration statement for this purpose?"
    choices:
    - content: "foreach"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  It's possible to perform this operation using any of these iteration statements, however you should probably use `foreach`."
    - content: "for"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's possible to use the `for` statement, but the `foreach` statement was created for working with sequences."
    - content: "do-while"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's possible to use the `do-while` statement, but the `foreach` statement was created for working with sequences."
    - content: "while"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's possible to use the `while` statement, but the `foreach` statement was created for working with sequences."
  - content: "You need to capture a list of items from the user.  They'll use the keyboard combination `ctrl + Esc` to exit.  Which is the best iteration statement for this purpose?"
    choices:
    - content: "foreach"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's remotely possible to use the `foreach` statement for this purpose, but it wouldn't be straight forward."
    - content: "for"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's possible to use the `for` statement, but the `do-while` will allow the code to iterate indefinitely until the user to check for the special keyboard combination without using a `break` statement."
    - content: "do-while"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  The `do-while` will allow you to check each entry by the user until they enter the special keyboard combination to exit."
    - content: "while"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's possible to use the `while` statement, but the `do-while` will allow the user to enter a value first before you begin checking for the special keyboard combination."
