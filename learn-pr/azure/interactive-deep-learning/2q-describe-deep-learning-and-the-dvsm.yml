  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following best describes the difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning?
    choices:
    - content: In traditonal machine learning we use all kinds of models - graph, algebraic and probablistic. In deep learning, we only use linear models.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Deep learning finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output, whether it's a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship. 
    - content: In traditional machine learning, features are handcrafted. In deep learning, they're learned.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: In Deep Learning (DL), the process of feature extraction is learned through representing inputs as vectors and transforming them, with a series of clever linear algebra operations, into a given output.
    - content: In traditional machine learning, the algorithms are modeled after the heart. Deep learning is modeled after the brain.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Deep learning is concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. However, machine learning is not modeled after the heart. 
  - content: What happens if you deploy the Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) image to a CPU-based Azure VM?
    choices:
    - content: Everything breaks, because you can only deploy the DSVM to a GPU-based Azure VM.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: The DSVM works seamlessley with both GPU- and CPU-based VMs. 
    - content: Everything works fine because the deep learning frameworks will fallback to CPU mode. 
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: The DSVM works seamlessley with both GPU- and CPU-based VMs. 
    - content: You need to update the pre-installed deep learning frameworks to run on the CPU.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: The DSVM works seamlessley with both GPU- and CPU-based VMs. 
  - content: Why are GPUs often used for deep learning?
    choices:
    - content: The matrix algebra in deep learning requires lots of parallel computation and GPUs are very well suited to that kind of computation.
      correctExplanation: The series of matrix operations that we compute as part of the linear algebra component tend to be computationally expensive and are often heavily parallelizable, requiring specialized compute such as Graphics Processing Units GPUs to compute efficiently.
      isCorrect: true
    - content: GPUs make deep learning models converge during gradient decent.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Convergence of a deep learning model during gradient descent is independent of the processing unit that is used. 
    - content: GPUs are needed to evaluate a loss function. 
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: GPUs are not needed to evaluate a loss function. 
# Removed the following question because the lesson doesn't go into enough detail about VM sizes. 
# - content: 'What is the difference between an N-Series and D-Series machines on Azure?'
# choices:
# - content: D series are for deep learning where as N series are for Normal compute.
# isCorrect: false
# - content: D series are for general compute where as N series contain GPUs.
# isCorrect: true
# - content: D series are for high preformance compute where as N series contain GPUs.
# isCorrect: false
