  questions:
  - content: Which of the following describes CUDA?
    choices:
    - content: It's a parallel computing platform and API.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels.
    - content: It's a super powerful CPU.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: CUDA is a software layer and is designed for GPUs. 
    - content: It's a deep learning model used for image classification.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: CUDA-enabled GPUs can greatly improve compute performacne when training neural networks, but that is only one of its uses.
  - content: Which of the following describes Docker?
    choices:
    - content: Docker is a specialized piece of hardware for training neural networks.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Docker is actually software that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization". 
    - content: Docker is an open platform for distributed applications.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud. It's a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization".
    - content: Docker is a library for web apps.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Docker is a software platform, but it's not a library for helping you to create web apps.
  - content: What's the main benefit of using NVIDIA Docker?
    choices:
    - content: It allows you to build and run Docker containers on Windows.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: NVIDIA Docker only runs on Linux.
    - content: It allows you to build and run Docker containers that leverage NVIDIA GPUs.
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: NVIDIA developer nvidia-docker as an open-source project to support driver-agnostice CUDA image and as a wrapper around the Docker command-line wrapper that knows how to mount the right GPU components into the container at launch. 
    - content: It allows you to containerize CPU-accelerated applications.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: NVIDIA Docker allows you to containerize your GPU-accelerated apps.
