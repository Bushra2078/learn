  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following best describes the dependency challenges faced when using the DSVM for deep learning?
    choices:
    - content: The DSVM is sandboxed and doesn't provide direct support for installing new packages.
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: The DSVM is a virtual machine. It comes with lots of pre-installed software to help with data science and AI project, but you are free to install whatever you want. 
    - content: The DSVM only supports CNTK and Cognitive Service dependencies.
      incorrectExplanation: DSVMs provide out of the box support for many popular frameworks such as PyTorch, Chainer, and Tensorflow.
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Certain deep learning frameworks and packages require different enviorments, GPU drivers and binary packages
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Managing the dependencies between all the frameworks you are using for deep learning can be a challenge. Running a Docker container to group and isolate these dependencies can help with this challenge.
  - content: Suppose you've been experimenting with deep learning in a Docker container. Your DSVM is running on a Linux virtual machine that also has GPUs. Which of the followign commands to you run to provision a container with the necessary components to execute code on the GPU. 
    choices:
    - content: docker run --useGPU
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: The docker run command does not have a parameter called --useGPU
    - content: nvidia-docker run
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: This command can be used to execute a container that uses GPUs. 
    - content: docker-nvidia run
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: This command doesn't exist.
