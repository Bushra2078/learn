You have successfully completed the assessment of the role of Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Blob Storage for storing IoT telemetry data. You have also explored the options for integrating your cloud-native applications with Azure Cosmos DB. You are confident that this integration will allow you to extend the scope of your solution to incorporate IoT telemetry collected from smart appliances.

In this module, you learned about integration of IoT pipelines with a range of Azure services, including Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Blob Storage. Throughout its course, you provisioned an Azure Cosmos DB account, set up an Azure IoT Central application and an Azure Function to process telemetry data and store it in a designated Cosmos DB container, and accessed the content of that container by using a Next.js application.

Now that you have completed this module, you should be able to:

* Create and configure Azure Cosmos DB-based data store.
* Implement Azure IoT Central-based telemetry processing by using Azure Functions.
* Connect Next.js applications to Azure Cosmos DB.
