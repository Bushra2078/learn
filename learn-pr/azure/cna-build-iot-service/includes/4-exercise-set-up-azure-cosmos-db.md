This exercise provides an overview of setting up an Azure Cosmos DB account and database. 

In this exercise, you'll:

- Create an Azure Cosmos DB account.
- Create an Azure Cosmos DB database.

## Prerequisites

To perform this exercise, you need:

- An Azure subscription
- A Microsoft account or an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account with the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription and with the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription.

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB account

1. Start a web browser, refer to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true), and sign in to access the Azure subscription you'll be using in this module.
1. Use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the beginning of the Azure portal page to search for **Azure Cosmos DB**, and in the list of results, select **Azure Cosmos DB**.
