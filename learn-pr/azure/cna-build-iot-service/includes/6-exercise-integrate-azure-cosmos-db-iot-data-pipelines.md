   * Leave the **Partition key** entry blank. When choosing an optimal partition key, it is important to consider the usage patterns and the 20 GB logical partition size limit. In this case, you could, for example, create a synthetic partition key consisting of a combination of **deviceId** and **date**.

1. Back on the **HttpTrigger1 \| Integration ** blade, in the vertical menu bar on the left side, in the **Developer** section, select **Code + Test**.
1. On the **HttpTrigger1 \| Code + Test** blade, replace the existing code with the following content and select **Save** to save your changes:

   ```csharp
   #r "Newtonsoft.Json"

   using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
   using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
   using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

   public static void Run(HttpRequest req, out object outDoc, ILogger log)
   {
     log.LogInformation($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {req.Body}");

     string requestBody = new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEnd();
     dynamic iotData = JObject.Parse(requestBody);

     log.LogInformation($"{iotData}");

     outDoc = new {
       pk = iotData.device.id + "-" + iotData.timestamp.ToString("yyyyMMdd"),
       timestamp = iotData.timestamp
       deviceId = iotData.device.id,
       temperature = iotData.device.telemetry.Thermostat_1o.temp.value
     };
   }
   ```

   ![Screenshot that shows the Add function blade of the Azure Function app in the Azure portal](../media/6-azure-function-app-function-code-test.png)

   * The function logs the JSON-based payload of the HTTP request and constructs individual JSON elements to be stored in an individual document of the target Cosmos DB collection corresponding to the function output you configured. The pk element, consisting of the concatenated deviceId property and date of the collected telemetry data point could be used as the partition key.

1. On the **HttpTrigger1 \| Code + Test** blade, select **Get function URL** and record its value.

   ![Screenshot that shows the second part of the sample Azure IoT Central application rule.](../media/3-iot-custom-application-rule-2.png)

   * The value of the temperature telemetry is intentionally artificially low in order to invoke the webhook functionality and trigger the function. In real-life scenarios, you would adjust it in order to correspond to the condition that warrants collection of data that you intend to store in the target Cosmos DB collection.

1. On the **Rules** page, select **Done** and then select **Save**.
1. Switch back to the web browser window displaying the **HttpTrigger1 \| Code + Test** blade in the Azure portal, in the vertical menu on the left side, in the **Developer** section, select the **Monitor** entry, and on the **HttpTrigger1 \| Code + Test** blade, select the **Logs** tab.
1. Verify that the logs pane displays the messages generated in response to the HTTP trigger originating from the Azure IoT Central application webhook you configured earlier in this task.
