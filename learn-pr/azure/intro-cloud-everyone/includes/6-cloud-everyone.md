## Cloud for Everyone 

The Cloud for Everyone perspective guides us to harness the diverse attributes and needs of our customers to shape new experiences for businesses and individuals alike. The core tenets that guide our philosophy ensure:

- Development of products and services that minimize the level of ability required for usage.

- We provide the best possible coverage for the population, seeking to close the gaps between aspirations and access.

- We represent every person and community that could benefit from our cloud technologies.

You might have heard some of these themes before. It's easy to declare support for good ideas and intentions. But there's a difference between intentions and actions, and between intent and results. Microsoft is committed to the power of technology for everyone, and to Cloud for Everyone. This enables every person and every organization to achieve more. And perhaps most importantly, we’re aligned to action. We’re committed to converting our intentions and ideas into tangible actions with long-lasting positive impacts. We will measure success with meaningful outcomes that affect lives.

While we want to move quickly and drive results, it's important to remember we're on a journey. This requires a long-term approach combined with hard work. Real growth and progress towards empowering everyone can only happen when we embrace the "not knowing" and realize that what we don't know will be what truly drives change. We welcome this commitment with a growth mindset, one where even the most significant challenges are not impossible to solve; they just haven't been solved yet. This belief will be a core aspect of how Microsoft embraces this commitment. Empowering everyone with the might of technology will never be "done." Still, with time and permission to explore, learn, adapt, improve, and evolve, we see the possibility of amazing results ahead.

Imagining what’s possible with the power of technology inspires us. Everyone brings infinitely diverse perspectives and backgrounds. It follows that there are equally infinite, diverse, and surprising innovations and ideas that technology can power when it's in the hands of each individual. We can't wait to see how the power of our cloud technologies will amplify the inspirations, ideas, and impact for all concerned.
