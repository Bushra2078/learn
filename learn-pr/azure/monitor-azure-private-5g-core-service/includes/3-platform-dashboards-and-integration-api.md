In addition to Azure Log Analytics, Azure Private 5G Core offers a list of platform dashboards, which provides you visualized views of network health metrics. For example, you can check metrics such as idle UEs connected or session establishment failures through the platform dashboards.

Azure Private 5G Core also offers you the capability to use other applications to monitor a private mobile network. From the applications, you can use the Azure Monitor REST API to retrieve the health metrics that Azure Private 5G Core shares.

## Platform dashboards

Azure Private 5G Core displays the platform dashboards on the **Overview** page of the Azure site resource that you use to manage the relevant site, as shown below:
