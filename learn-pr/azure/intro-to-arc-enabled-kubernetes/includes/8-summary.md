In this module, you learned how Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters can help customers like Contoso to optimize and simplify their operations. 

While Contoso will need to continue to operate in a hybrid environment for the foreseeable future, its IT staff will be able to minimize management overhead of their containerized workloads with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes technology. This will allow them to extend the scope of such services as Azure Policy and Azure Monitor to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. By embracing the GitOps approach, Contoso will streamline updates to cluster configuration across their entire environment and minimize the risks associated with configuration drift.
