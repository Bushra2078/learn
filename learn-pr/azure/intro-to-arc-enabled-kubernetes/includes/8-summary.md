In this module, you learned how Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters can help organizations optimize and simplify their operations. While Contoso continues to operate in a hybrid environment, its IT staff can minimize management overhead for their containerized workloads with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes. Contoso can extend the scope of services like Azure Policy and Azure Monitor to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. By embracing GitOps, Contoso can streamline updates to cluster configuration across their environment, and minimize the risk of configuration drift.
