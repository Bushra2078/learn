## Notes

This should be an overview module of what Azure AD is, differentiating it from traditional AD, and what the different features (B2C, B2B, etc.) are. If we can add in a hands on exercise that adds value, then great, but this may be more topical in nature. Need to have a section on licensing, and would like to ensure we clarify terminology, and the architecture of AAD tenants/subscriptions/etc.
