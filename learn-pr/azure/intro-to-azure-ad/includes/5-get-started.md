Your organization has decided to use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to manage secure access. Users include doctors, external healthcare partners, and all internal staff members. You've been asked to look into implementing secure access for your organization.

Here, you'll learn how to take a phased approach to deploying Azure AD for your organization. You'll learn how to lay a foundation, deploy Azure AD by creating a tenant, and associate a subscription with it.

## Deploy in phases

A good way to deploy Azure AD is in phases. Your deployment is split into several stages. Each stage addresses a key aspect of Azure AD. A phase includes tasks that you'll need to complete before you go to the next stage. This approach lays a secure foundation for your Azure AD instance.

### Stage 1: Build a secure foundation

In the first stage, build a foundation of security for your Azure AD. The doctors, internal staff members, and external healthcare partners all need the most secure access you can provide. Configure baseline security features before you add or create user accounts. The work you do here helps ensure your Azure AD instance is in a secure state from the start. The following table describes your tasks.

| Task                                                         | Description                                                       | License needed   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Assign more than one global administrator.**| Give at least two Azure AD accounts the global administrator role. Make sure you don't use these accounts daily. Ensure the accounts have long and complicated passwords.| Free       |
| **Use regular administrative roles where possible.**|Administrators who aren't global administrators should never have more permissions than they need to do their work. Use these regular administrator roles by default. Avoid using the global administrator roles unless you need to. | Free       |
| **Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to track administrators.**| Use PIM to monitor how your administrator roles are used. This action helps you improve your governance and compliance.| Azure AD Premium P2 |
| **Configure self-service password reset.**| Let internal users reset their passwords through policies that you configure. This action reduces the number of help desk tickets for password resets.  |Free |
| **Create a list of banned passwords.** | Use this list to prevent users from using passwords that are common phrases or words in your organization. Your list can include your company name or headquarters location, for example. |Free |
| **Warn users to not reuse credentials.** | When someone reuses the same credentials on multiple platforms, an attacker can use the credentials to access all of those platforms if a single platform is compromised.  | Free       |
| **Set passwords to never expire for cloud-based user accounts.** | Routine password resetting tempts users to increment their existing passwords. For example, they might change their password from `R4ndom1Strong` to `R4ndom2Strong`, and so on. In this case, because most of the password remained the same it increases the risk of using already exposed credentials to gain access to an account. | Free       |                    |
| **Enforce multi-factor authentication through conditional-access policies.** | Configure conditional-access policies to require users to pass multiple authentication challenges before they can access an application. | Azure AD Premium P1 |
| **Configure Azure Active Directory Identity Protection (AADIP).** | Flag and block suspicious sign-ins and compromised user credentials for your organization's users. You can also use AADIP to automatically trigger multi-factor authentication or a password reset, depending on the severity of the detected risk. | Azure AD Premium P2 |
| | |

### Stage 2: Add users, manage devices, and configure synchronization

Now you can add users and plan how to handle external guest-user access. The following table describes your tasks in this stage.

| Task                                                         | Description                                                       | License needed                                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|**Install and configure Azure AD Connect.**| Use Azure AD Connect to synchronize users from your on-premises instance of Active Directory to Azure. | Free                                                |
|**Use password hash synchronization.**| You can synchronize password changes and detect and fix bad passwords. You get reports about leaked user credentials. | Free                                                |
|**Use password writeback.**| Configure password writeback so any changes to passwords in Azure are written to your on-premises instance of Active Directory. | Azure AD Premium P1                                          |
|**Use Azure AD Connect Health.**|  Use Azure AD Connect Health to monitor the health statistics for your Azure AD Connect environment. | Azure AD Premium P1                                          |
|**Give users the licenses they need at a group level.**| When you assign licenses at a group level, you control licensing for many users simultaneously. This action saves your organization time and reduces complexity.|Free|
|**Use Azure AD B2B Collaboration for guest-user access.**| Use this resource to ensure that external healthcare partner users can use their own work or social identities to access your applications and services. You don't need to manage their credentials for them. | Required licenses depend on which features you want the guest users to access|
|**Prepare a device-management strategy.** | Put together a plan based on which devices your company allows. For example, will you permit Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), or will the company accept only devices that it has given to users? |Free|
|**Provide authentication methods that don't require passwords.**| Make authentication more convenient. For example, if users have installed Microsoft Authenticator on their phones, they can receive a notification that provides a code to enter at sign-in, along with a PIN or a biometric attribute like their fingerprint. | Azure AD Premium P1

### Stage 3: Manage your applications

You can now integrate your applications with Azure AD. The following table describes your tasks in this stage.

| Task                                                         | Description                                                       | License needed    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Identify applications.**                                   |  Investigate the applications in your organization. Your organization could, for example, have applications on-premises or software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications in the cloud. Choose applications that you want to manage in Azure AD. | N/A |
|**Use SaaS applications in the Azure AD gallery.**|  Your organization probably uses SaaS applications that are already in the gallery and that you find in the Azure portal. Use these applications from the gallery whenever you can. You can save time by integrating your applications and Azure AD.  | Free       |
| **Integrate your on-premises applications by using Application Proxy.**| You can let Azure AD users sign in to your on-premises applications by using their Azure AD account. |Free

### Stage 4: Monitor your administrators, do access reviews, and automate user life cycles

Now you can address how much privilege your administrators should have, and you can complete access reviews. In this stage, you also configure how to automate common user life-cycle tasks. The following table describes your tasks in this stage.

| Task                                                         | Description                                                       | License needed    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
|**Use PIM to control administrator access.** | Ensure that administrators can use their account only after they pass a multi-factor authentication challenge or receive approval from an accepted approver. | Azure AD Premium P2 |
|**Complete access reviews for Azure AD directory roles in PIM.**| Configure access review policies in PIM so you can regularly review administrative access based on your organization's requirements for privileged roles.  | Azure AD Premium P2 |
|**Configure dynamic group membership policies.**| Save time and effort by automatically adding users to specific groups based on known profile information, like department or region. For example, you can automatically add all users who are part of the human resources department to a user group called Human Resources. |Free |
| **Use group-based application assignment.**| Use group-based access management to give all group members access to an application. When you use dynamic groups, users who are removed from a group automatically lose access to the application. This action helps keep your applications secure. |Free |
| **Configure automated user account provisioning and deactivation.** | Automatically create application-specific accounts to allow users to use SaaS applications, based on existing Azure AD users and groups. You can also automatically deprovision user accounts when a user leaves the organization. This action keeps your organization protected from unauthorized access. | Free|

## Create a tenant

After you lay the groundwork for your instance of Azure AD, you can begin to configure and start using it. You need to create a tenant, which is considered a resource in Azure.

Use the Azure portal to create a tenant and a new Azure AD resource.
