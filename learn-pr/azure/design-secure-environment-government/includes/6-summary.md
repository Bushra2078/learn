Multi-tenant cloud services such as Azure give government customers access to the resiliency and flexibility of the cloud while maintaining strict data protections essential for the public sector. Combining these features with private and hybrid cloud options allows agencies to design solutions for data at all classification levels. All data is protected through strict residency and encryption requirements. 

Now that youâ€™ve reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Explain the basic concept and benefits of public multi-tenant cloud services.
* Describe a conceptual architecture that protects data at various classification levels.
* Explain how residency and encryption features keep data of all classification levels safe.
