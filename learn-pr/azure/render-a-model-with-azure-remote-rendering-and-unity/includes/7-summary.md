The automotive engineering team needed a solution for rendering a 3D model of a truck engine at full detail on an untethered device. You created a Remote Rendering resource and then configured a remote rendering object in Unity. After completing those steps, you were able to load and render the truck engine model at full detail. If you have a HoloLens device, you can build the Unity project and deploy to view the model in your real-world environment.

## Clean up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
