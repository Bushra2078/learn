## Exercise 1 - Configuring readable secondaries

In this exercise, we will be looking at how to configure and use readable secondaries to take advantage of the secondary replica for our read-only workloads.

1. Open Azure Data Studio.
2. Expand the Connections Tab.
3. Expand Azure Arc Controllers.
4. Expand the data controller.
5. Setup the following details for the Business Critical Tier Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance:

    ```powershell
    $Env:SQLMIName = 'enter Business Critical Tier SQL Managed Instance Name here'
    $Env:MyNamespace = 'enter data controller namespace here'
    $Env:MyReadableSecondaries = 2
    ```

6. Execute the following command to review the current Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance configuration. Search for replicas to review the current configuration:

    ```powershell
    az sql mi-arc show -n $Env:SQLMIName `
        --k8s-namespace $Env:MyNamespace `
        --use-k8s

     "replicas": [
        {
          "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
          "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
          "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-0",
          "role": "PRIMARY",
          "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
          "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
        },
        {
          "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
          "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
          "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-1",
          "role": "SECONDARY",
          "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
          "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
        },
        {
          "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
          "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
          "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-2",
          "role": "SECONDARY",
          "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "NO",
          "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
        }
      ]
    ```

7. Execute the following command to configure 2 readable secondaries:

    ```powershell
    az sql mi-arc update --name $Env:SQLMIName `
        --readable-secondaries $Env:MyReadableSecondaries `
        --k8s-namespace $Env:MyNamespace `
        --use-k8s
    ```

![Screenshot of configure readable secondaries.](../media/exercise1-configure-readable-secondaries-1.png)

8. Re-execute step 6 to view the new configuration. You can see that both `ae-msl-sqlmi2-1` and `ae-msl-sqlmi2-2` are now configured as readable secondaries.

    ```
    "replicas": [
        {
          "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
          "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
          "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-0",
          "role": "PRIMARY",
          "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
          "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
        },
        {
          "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
          "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
          "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-1",
          "role": "SECONDARY",
          "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
          "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
        },
        {
          "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
          "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
          "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-2",
          "role": "SECONDARY",
          "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
          "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
        }
      ]
    ```

9. Search the results from the CLI command executed in step 8. Search for endpoints. Retrieve the secondary endpoint value.
10. In the connections Tab, select New Connection. Enter the connection details for your secondary endpoint. Select Connect.

![Screenshot of Managed Instance secondary endpoint connection.](../media/exercise1-managed-instance-secondary-endpoint-1.png)

11. Open a new query window for the new secondary endpoint connection and execute the following commands. Your servername should not be the current primary replica:

  ```sql
  Select @@ServerName;

  Use AdventureWorks2019
  GO

  Select *
  From HumanResources.Employee;
  ```

For this exercise, we will be simulating the failure or loss of the Kubernetes pod hosting and running the General Purpose Tier Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance container. 

1. Open Azure Data Studio.
2. Expand the Connections Tab.
3. Right-click on your General Purpose Tier SQL Managed Instance and select New Query.
4. Execute the following query to show access to the Instance of SQL Server and the AdventureWorks2019 database:

  ```sql
  Select @@ServerName;

  Use AdventureWorks2019
  GO

  Select *
  From HumanResources.Employee;
  ```

![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance General Purpose Tier high availability connectivity 1.](../media/exercise2-manage-general-purpose-high-availability-1.png)

5. Open the Terminal window.
6. Execute the following commands to view the Kubernetes pods:

  ```powershell
  $Env:MyNamespace = 'enter your data controller namespace here'
  kubectl get pods -n $Env:MyNamespace
  ```

![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance General Purpose tier high availability pods kubectl results for this namespace.](../media/exercise2-manage-general-purpose-pods-1.png)

7. Simulate a pod failure by executing the following command:

  ```powershell
  $Env:MyGPPod = 'enter SQL Managed Instance Name here-0'
  kubectl delete pod $Env:MyGPPod -n $Env:MyNamespace 
  ```

![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance General Purpose Tier HA Pods 2.](../media/exercise2-manage-general-purpose-pods-2.png)

8. Execute the following command to view the status of the pods:

  ```powershell
  kubectl get pods -n $Env:MyNamespace
  ```

![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance General Purpose Tier HA Pods 3.](../media/exercise2-manage-general-purpose-pods-3.png)

9. Re-execute step 8 to monitor the redeployment of the pod. Once the pod is back in a running state, you can perform standard checks to ensure the Instance of SQL Server is available and functioning as required.

   ![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance General Purpose tier high availability pods 4.](../media/exercise2-manage-general-purpose-pods-4.png)

10. Re-execute step 4 to see if the instance is available again. This proves your instance is back available and accessible.

## Exercise 3 - Discovering Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance Business Critical Tier High Availability

For this exercise, we will be simulating the failure or loss of the Kubernetes pod hosting and running the Business Critical Tier Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance container.

1. Open Azure Data Studio.
2. Expand the Connections Tab.
3. Right-click on your Business Critical tier SQL Managed Instance and select New Query.
4. Execute the following query to show access to the Instance of SQL Server and the AdventureWorks2019 database:

   ```sql
   Select @@ServerName;
 
   Use AdventureWorks2019
   GO

   Select *
   From HumanResources.Employee;
   ```

   ![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance Business Critical Tier high availability connectivity 1.](../media/exercise2-manage-business-critical-high-availability-1.png)

5. Open the Terminal window.
6. Execute the following commands to view the Kubernetes pods:

   ```powershell
   $Env:MyNamespace = 'enter your data controller namespace here'
   kubectl get pods -n $Env:MyNamespace
   ```

   ![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance Business Critical Tier high availability pods 1.](../media/exercise2-manage-business-critical-pods-1.png)

7. Simulate a pod failure by executing the following command:

   ```powershell
   $Env:MyBCPod = 'enter SQL Managed Instance Name here-0'
   kubectl delete pod $Env:MyBCPod -n $Env:MyNamespace 
   ```

   ![Screenshot of delete pod command.](../media/exercise2-manage-business-critical-pods-2.png)

8. Execute the following command to view the status of the pods:

   ```powershell
   kubectl get pods -n $Env:MyNamespace
   ```

   ![Screenshot of pods, showing newly started pod.](../media/exercise2-manage-business-critical-pods-3.png)

9. Re-execute step 4 to see if the instance is available, running on 'SQLMI-1'. Service disruption should be minimal, and your applications need re-connect functionality.

   ![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance Business Critical tier high availability successful query.](../media/exercise2-manage-business-critical-high-availability-2.png)

10. Execute the following command to view the status of the Contained Availability Group:

   ```powershell
   $Env:MyResource-group = 'enter your resource group name here'
   az sql mi-arc list --k8s-namespace $Env:MyNamespace --use-k8s
   ```

   ![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance Business Critical tier high availability failed query.](../media/exercise2-manage-business-critical-availability-group-status-1.png)

11. Check the status of all replicas in the Contained Availability Group with the following command. Search for `highAvailability` in the output:

  ```powershell
  $Env:SQLMIName = 'enter your SQLMI name here'
  az sql mi-arc show --name $Env:SQLMIName --resource-group $Env:MyresourceGroup

  "highAvailability": {
          "healthState": "Healthy",
          "lastUpdateTime": "2022-06-07T00:39:38.927189Z",
          "mirroringCertificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n \n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
          "replicas": [
            {
              "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
              "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
              "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-0",
              "role": "SECONDARY",
              "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
              "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
            },
            {
              "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
              "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
              "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-1",
              "role": "PRIMARY",
              "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
              "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
            },
            {
              "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
              "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
              "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-2",
              "role": "SECONDARY",
              "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
              "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
            }
          ]
        }
  ```

12. Prepare for a manual failover from the existing primary replica - `'your sqlmi name-1'` back to the original primary replica - `'your sqlmi name-0'.` In the terminal window, execute the following commands to set the preferred primary replica:

   ```PowerShell
   $Env:MyPreferredPrimaryReplica = 'your sqlmi name-1'
   az sql mi-arc update --name $Env:SQLMIName `
     --k8s-namespace $Env:MyNamespace `
     --use-k8s `
     --preferred-primary-replica $Env:MyPreferredPrimaryReplica
   ```

   ![Screenshot of SQL Managed Instance Business Critical tier high availability manual failover.](../media/exercise3-manage-business-critical-manual-failover-1.png)

13. Run the `az sql mi-arc update` CLI command from step 12 again to perform the actual failover.

14. Run step 11 again to confirm the changed primary replica roles.

   ```
   "highAvailability": {
           "healthState": "Healthy",
           "lastUpdateTime": "2022-06-07T00:39:38.927189Z",
           "mirroringCertificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n \n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
           "replicas": [
             {
               "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
               "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
               "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-0",
               "role": "PRIMARY",
               "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
               "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
             },
             {
               "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
               "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
               "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-1",
               "role": "SECONDARY",
               "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
               "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
             },
             {
               "availabilityMode": "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT",
               "connectedState": "CONNECTED",
               "replicaName": "ae-msl-sqlmi2-2",
               "role": "SECONDARY",
               "secondaryRoleAllowConnections": "ALL",
               "synchronizationState": "HEALTHY"
             }
           ]
         }
   ```

  ```PowerShell
  Kubectl config use-context $Env:MyPrimaryCluster
  ```

   ![Screenshot of Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance Primary Site Cluster Context.](../media/exercise5-prepare-primary-site-cluster-context-1.png)

5. Retrieve the mirroring certificate for the primary site. This is required to be accessible to both sites. In this example, we are using the local user account home location. Ensure you set this appropriately for your environment. You can confirm the creation of the `sqlprimary.pem` certificate file in your configured local location.

  ```PowerShell
  az sql mi-arc get-mirroring-cert --subscription $Env:MySubcriptionID `
    --name $Env:MyPrimaryInstance  `
    --cert-file "$Env:MyCertFullPath\$Env:MyPrimaryCertFile" `
    --k8s-namespace $Env:MyPrimaryNamespace `
    --use-k8s
  ```

6. Retrieve the SQL Managed Instance Mirroring Endpoint IP address for the primary site:

  ```PowerShell
  $PrimaryMirroringEndpoint = $(
    az sql mi-arc show -n $Env:MyPrimaryInstance `
        --resource-group $Env:MyPrimaryResourceGroup `
        -o tsv `
        --query 'properties.k8SRaw.status.endpoints.mirroring'
  )

  $Env:MyPrimaryMirroringIP = "tcp://$PrimaryMirroringEndpoint"
  ```

7. Prepare your Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance secondary site parameter values:

    --cert-file "$Env:MyCertFullPath\$Env:MySecondaryCertFile" `
    --k8s-namespace $Env:MySecondaryNamespace `
    --use-k8s
  ```

10. Retrieve the SQL Managed Instance Mirroring Endpoint IP address for the secondary site:

  ```PowerShell
  $SecondaryMirroringEndpoint = $(
    az sql mi-arc show -n $Env:MySecondaryInstance  `
        --resource-group $Env:MySecondaryResourceGroup `
        -o tsv `
        --query 'properties.k8SRaw.status.endpoints.mirroring'
  )

  $Env:MySecondaryMirroringIP = "tcp://$SecondaryMirroringEndpoint" 
  ```

11. Ensure you are connected to your primary site Kubernetes Cluster.

  ```PowerShell
  Kubectl config use-context $Env:MyPrimaryCluster
  ```

12. Create the Azure Failover Group Primary resource on the primary site.

  ```PowerShell
  az sql instance-failover-group-arc create --shared-name $Env:MyAFG `
    --name $Env:MyPrimaryDAG  `
    --mi $Env:MyPrimaryInstance `
    --role primary `
    --partner-mi $Env:MySecondaryInstance  `
    --partner-mirroring-url $Env:MySecondaryMirroringIP `
    --partner-mirroring-cert-file "$Env:MyCertFullPath\$Env:MySecondaryCertFile" `
    --k8s-namespace $Env:MyPrimaryNamespace `
    --use-k8s

    ## The output should display: Deploying $Env:MyPrimaryDAG in namespace $Env:MyPrimaryNamespace
    ## $Env:MyPrimaryDAG is Ready

  ## Confirm primary resource has been created
  az sql instance-failover-group-arc show --subscription $Env:MySubcriptionID `
    --name $Env:MyPrimaryDAG `
    --k8s-namespace $Env:MyPrimaryNamespace `
    --use-k8s

  ## The output should have similar to this:
    "sharedName": "aemsldag",
    "sourceMI": "ae-msl-sqlmi2",
    "partnerMI": "ae-msl-sqlmi3",
    "partnerMirroringURL": "tcp://20.70.91.199:5022"
  ```

13. Ensure you are connected to your secondary site Kubernetes Cluster.

  ```PowerShell
  Kubectl config use-context $Env:MySecondaryCluster
  ```

14. Create the Azure Failover Group Secondary resource on the secondary site.

  ```PowerShell
  az sql instance-failover-group-arc create --shared-name $Env:MyAFG `
    --name $Env:MySecondaryDAG `
    --mi $Env:MySecondaryInstance `
    --role secondary `
    --partner-mi $Env:MyPrimaryInstance `
    --partner-mirroring-url $Env:MyPrimaryMirroringIP `
    --partner-mirroring-cert-file "$Env:MyCertFullPath\$Env:MyPrimaryCertFile" `
    --k8s-namespace $Env:MySecondaryNamespace `
    --use-k8s

    ## The output should display: Deploying $Env:MySecondaryDAG in namespace $Env:MySecondaryNamespace
    ## $Env:MySecondaryDAG is Ready

  ## Confirm secondary resource has been created
  az sql instance-failover-group-arc show --subscription $Env:MySubcriptionID `
    --name $Env:MySecondaryDAG `
    --k8s-namespace $Env:MySecondaryNamespace `
    --use-k8s 

  ## The output should have similar to this:
    "sharedName": "aemsldag",
    "sourceMI": "ae-msl-sqlmi3",
    "partnerMI": "ae-msl-sqlmi2",
    "partnerMirroringURL": "tcp://20.92.195.233:5022"
  ```

15. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the primary external endpoint for the primary site instance. Expand the Always On High Availability Tree. You should now see the newly created Azure Failover Group.

   ![Screenshot of Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance Primary Site Distributed AG - SQL Server Management Studio.](../media/exercise5-primary-site-distributed-availability-group.png)

16. In SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the primary external endpoint for the secondary site instance. Expand the Always On High Availability Tree. You should now see the newly created Azure Failover Group.

   ![Screenshot of Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance Primary Site Distributed AG.](../media/exercise5-secondary-site-distributed-availability-group.png)

17. Expand the database tree on the secondary site instance. You should see the AdventureWorks2019 database that was restored to your primary site instance previously. Notice you did not have to perform any tasks to get your primary site database onto your secondary site instance. With the creation of the Azure Failover Group (Distributed Availability Group), all databases on the primary instance will automatically be seeded to the secondary site. Depending on the size of the database, the network bandwidth between the primary and secondary sites will dictate the time for the databases to be synchronized.
