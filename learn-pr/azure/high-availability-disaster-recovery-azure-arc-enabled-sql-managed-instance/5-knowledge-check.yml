quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Through which mechanism does Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance provide High Availability for the General Purpose service tier?"
    choices:
    - content: "Kubernetes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With the General Purpose tier, high availability option is provided by Kubernetes."
    - content: "Contained Availability Groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Kubernetes provides the ability to provide high availability for General Purpose tier deployments, while Contained Availability Groups provide high availability for Business Critical tier deployments. The service tier will impact the amount of time taken to perform a failover and be up and functional again."
    - content: "Azure Container Instances"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With the General Purpose tier, high availability option is provided by Kubernetes."
  - content: "Which option is valid for recovering a database prior to an issue being experienced, allowing for recovering maliciously damaged or corrupt data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Performing a manual failover to a secondary replica in the primary site."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This will not recover a database to a point in time prior to the identified issue."
    - content: "Performing a point in time restore to just before the identified incident."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Doing so will revert the state of the data to what it was prior to the identified issue."
    - content: "Performing a manual failover to a secondary site."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This will not recover a database to a point in time prior to the identified issue."
  - content: "Which command performs a failover to the secondary site when the primary site Kubernetes cluster is lost?"
    choices:
    - content: "az sql instance-failover-group-arc update --role secondary"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command can only be executed if the primary site kubernetes cluster is available."
    - content: "az sql instance-failover-group-arc update --role force-primary-allow-data-loss"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This command forces the chosen secondary to become the primary and allows data loss to occur to bring the new primary replica online."
    - content: "az sql mi-arc update --preferred-primary-replica"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command is used to set the new primary replica in the primary site. This does not allow for failover to a secondary site."
