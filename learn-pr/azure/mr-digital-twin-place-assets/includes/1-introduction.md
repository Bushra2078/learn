A well-designed user experience in Unity for the HoloLens involves designing and creating a Unity Scene.  A Scene is like a blank canvas where you will set up an experience for your end user. Providing some context for your user is important, which can be achieved by adding supportive information such as satellite imagery or other, typically lower fidelity, supportive information (e.g., surrounding warehouse infrastructure).  

Once the context has been established for the Scene, you need to create and add the 3D assets or models you intend to use for your Digital Twin.  In your case, you will add the wind turbine assets to your scene that have been created for you.  It is these 3D assets that you can be connected to cloud services such as Azure Digital Twin to operationalize your Digital Twins.â€ƒ
