### General guidance (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)
###  - Questions are complete sentences ending with a question mark
###  - No true/false questions
###  - 3 answers per question
###  - All answers about the same length
###  - Numeric answers listed in sorted order
###  - No "All of the above" and/or "None of the above" as answer choices
###  - No "Not" or "Except" in questions
###  - No second person ("you") in the questions or answers
###  - Provide a meaningful explanation for both correct and incorrect answers
###
### Question content requirements:
###  - Write 5 questions
###  - Questions 1,2 must test this Learning Objective: "Describe how <attributes> of <product> work to <solve problem>"
###      Guidance: These two questions can be short, no need for a long scenario to analyze. Test if they understand how the product works.
###      Example: "What differentiates an action from a control action in an Azure Logic App?"
###  - Questions 3,4,5 must test this Learning Objective: "Evaluate whether <product> is appropriate to <general product use case>"
###      Guidance: Use scenario questions that ask the learner to analyze a situation with the "when to use" criteria presented in the module.
###      Example: "Suppose you work for a financial company. You're building a system to let your brokers trade financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you'll have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?"

quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "If an Azure NetApp Files volume will be accessed by both Windows and Linux machines, which is the best file protocol option to assign to the volume?"
    choices:
    - content: "NFSv4"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Azure NetApp Files volumes that use only the NFSv4 protocol can be readily accessed by Linux machines, mounting NFS volumes in Windows is a complex task."
    - content: "SMB3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NetApp Files volumes that use only the SMB3 protocol can be accessed by Windows machines. However, mounting SMB volumes in Linux requires additional configuration."
    - content: "NFSv3 and SMB3"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NetApp Files supports creating volumes that use NFSv3 and SMB3 simultaneously, which enables both Linux and Windows machines to mount the volume without extra configuration."
  - content: "If an enterprise app requires 128 MiB/s throughput and a 2 TiB volume size, which Azure NetApp Files service tier should you select when you create the capacity pool, assuming the pool uses automatic QoS?"
    choices:
    - content: "Premium"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Premium tier provides up to 64 MiB/s of throughput per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned, so provisioning 2 TiB for the volume gives you up to 128 MiB/s throughput."
    - content: "Ultra"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Ultra tier provides up to 128 MiB/s of throughput per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned, so provisioning 2 TiB for the volume gives you up to 256 MiB/s throughput, which is more than you need."
    - content: "Standard"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Standard tier provides up to 16 MiB/s of throughput per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned, so provisioning 2 TiB for the volume gives you up to 32 MiB/s throughput, which is less than you need."
  - content: "Suppose your a VDI administrator responsible for thousands of virtual desktops. A key consideration for your infrastructure is the capability of rolling back the profile of any user to an earlier configuration, which is useful for troubleshooting. You also require the capability of reverting an entire volume to an earlier state, which can help your company recover from a ransomware attack. When considering migrating your VDI deployment to Azure, which of the following Azure NetApp Files features gives you the above capabilities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Quality of Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Quality of Service is a method for assigning throughput to a capacity pool (Auto or Manual). You can't use this setting to revert Azure NetApp Files data to an earlier state."
    - content: "NetApp Cloud Sync"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NetApp Cloud Sync is a third-party service for transferring NAS data between on-premises and cloud storage. You can't use this service to revert Azure NetApp Files data to an earlier state."
    - content: "Snapshots"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A snapshot is a point-in-time image of a volume that enables you to roll back files and directories to an earlier state and to revert the entire volume to an earlier configuration."
  - content: "Suppose you're an IT administrator and you've been asked to research the viability of moving the company's enterprise apps to Azure and using Azure NetApp Files for the apps' shared storage. The main constraint you face is that you have only a minimal budget to perform the actual migration, which means the migration must be performed with little or no modifications to the app code, data, or configuration. Which of the following best describes this type of migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Low latency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Latency is the time required to access a particular storage location and has nothing to do with migrating workloads to the cloud."
    - content: "Lift and shift"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A lift-and-shift migration is one where you transition your workload into the cloud without having to change the components, configuration, or code of your application."
    - content: "Subnet delegation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A delegated subnet is a subnet configured with permissions to create resources that are specific to a service, such as Azure NetApp Files."
  - content: "Suppose you're an administrator who is evaluating Azure NetApp Files as a shared storage solution. Which of the following best describes a scenario where you would counsel against using Azure NetApp Files?"
    choices:
    - content: "You have a small-scale, low-performance workload that consists mostly of static content with relatively constant demand."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NetApp Files is best used with large-scale, high-performance workloads with elastic content and demand."
    - content: "You have a high-performance computing simulation application that requires very high IOPS and very low latency."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NetApp Files supports up to 450,000 IOPS and sub-millisecond latency, so it is ideal for this type of application."
    - content: "You have a massive Microsoft SQL Server deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The high throughput and very low latency offered by Azure NetApp Files makes it well suited as a shared storage container for even the largest databases."
