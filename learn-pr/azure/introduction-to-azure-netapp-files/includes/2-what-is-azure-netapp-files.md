<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) ---------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly state that this unit will define the product.

    Heading: none

    Example: "Let's start with a few definitions and a quick tour of the core features of Logic Apps. This overview should help you see whether Logic Apps might be a good fit for your work."
-->
TODO: add your topic sentences(s)

<!-- 2. Background-concept definitions (optional) ----------------------------------------

    Goal:
        Define any needed underlying concepts or terms the learner must know to understand the product.
        Repeat this pattern multiple times if multiple concepts are needed.

    Heading:
        "## What is <concept>?"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that gives a definition "<concept> is..." (ensure this is a definition, do not give use cases like "<concept> lets you...").
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-3 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        (Note: the product "Logic Apps" implements business processes in the cloud; therefore, "business process" is a background concept.)
        Heading: "What is a business process?
        Lead sentence: "A business process or _workflow_ is a sequence of tasks that produce a specific outcome. The result might be a decision, some data, or a notification...."
-->

<!-- 3. Define the product -------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        Give a formal and precise definition of the product.

    Heading:
        "## <product> definition"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that gives a definition "<product> is..." (ensure this is a definition, do not give use cases like "<product> lets you...").
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-3 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        Heading: "Azure Logic Apps definition"
        Lead sentence: "Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that automates the execution of your business processes."
-->

## Azure NetApp Files definition

Widest choice of file protocols (NFSv3, NFSv4.1, SMB3) in the public cloud
On-premises class availability and performance with multiple tiers (Ultra, Premium, Standard)
Most advanced enterprise data management (Snapshots, Clones, Replication)
Azure consistent experience, support, and billing â€”Azure portal, not marketplace!

Programmable via API or CLI

cloud:
agility
scalability
flexibility
elasticity
simplicity
cost

apps, data, services

core enterprise apps
SAP, Oracle, SQL

un-migratable

the bottleneck for business-critical workloads is storage. If your enterprise workload relies on a external storage systems that are file-based
performance: low latency, high throughput
reliability: high availability
security:
enterprise data management: snapshots, clones, cross-region replication

workloads
enterprise file workloads
database
containerized apps
HPC (high performance computing) - some use cases here: https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/high-performance-computing/what-is-hpc/
  HPC in the cloud is cheaper because you only use it when you need it
VDI

verticals and industries:
semiconductor EDA
e-commerce

you want to "lift and shift" your workload that is, you want to transition your workload into the cloud without having to change the components, configuration, or code of your application.
This minimizes the risk that your workload will have problems once it starts running in the cloud and it minimizes the costs, effort,and time required to migrate your workload.

<!-- 4. Solve the scenario -------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        At a high level, describe how the <product> solves one of the customer tasks in your <scenario>.
        Avoid teaching how to actually do the work (you're not teaching how-to-use in this module).

    Heading:
        "## How to <solve scenario>"

    Pattern:
        1. H2 heading.
        2. Lead sentence that summarizes how the <product> solved the <scenario>.
        3. Additional text as needed (typically 1-2 paragraphs total, integrate the lead sentence into the first paragraph).
        4. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).

    Example:
        Heading: "How to implement a Twitter monitor"
        Lead sentence: "To implement a Twitter monitor, you map each task to a Logic Apps component and connect them with conditional logic."
-->

<!-- 5. Additional content (optional, as needed) ------------------------------------------------

    Goal:
        The section is a catch-all for any information not covered in the sections above.
        Repeat the pattern here as many times as needed.

    Possible topics:
        - Key feature(s).
        - Example use case in addition to the scenario.
        - High-level of how practitioners use the product (e.g. there's an API and a web UI to support multiple use cases).
        - Business value (e.g. it lets you do something that would be difficult to achieve without <product>).

    Pattern:
        Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
            1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk.
            2. 1-3 paragraphs of text, with a strong lead sentence in the first paragraph.
            3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote (image preferred).
