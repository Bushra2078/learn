As part of the Security Operations Center team, you need to protect Contoso's environment. To accomplish this goal, you first need to detect any threats to the environment.

In this module, you learned how to hunt for threats by using the tools available in Azure Sentinel. That activity included proactively identifying threat behaviors by using Azure Sentinel queries. You also learned to continue the hunt by using bookmarks and livestreams to identify specific account-usage patterns for Contoso's Azure environment.

Now, you should be able to lead your team in using Azure Sentinel to help protect Contoso's environment through threat detection.
