Imagine you're building a large mission-critical application. Your application comprises multiple microservices that must work coherently to provide your customers a seamless experience.

Having these microservices communicate over REST presents a bottleneck that can be solved by embracing asynchronous programming concepts. Using a queue helps you decouple different aspects of your application so that you can develop, maintain, and scale them as your workload adapts.

You decide to create an Azure Service Bus namespace to act as a message broker to bring the advantages of asynchronous programming to your Java applications. You plan to use your familiarity with Java and Spring ecosystems and use the familiar Java Message Service (JMS) 2.0 API to communicate with Service Bus.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Learn about JMS 2.0 and how to use it to interact with Service Bus.
* Write a Spring Boot application to send messages to Service Bus.
* Write a Spring Boot application to receive messages from Service Bus.
