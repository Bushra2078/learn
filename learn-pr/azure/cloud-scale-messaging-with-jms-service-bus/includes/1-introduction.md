Imagine you are building a large mission critical application. Your application comprises of multiple microservices that must work coherently to provide your customers a seamless experience.

Having these microservices communicate over REST presents a bottleneck that can be solved by embracing asynchronous programming concepts. This helps you decouple different aspects of your application so as to develop, maintain and scale them as your workload adapts.

You decide to create an Azure Service Bus namespace to act as a message broker to bring the advantages of asynchronous programming to your Java applications. You plan to use your familiarity with Java and Spring ecosystems and leverage the familiar Java Message Service (JMS) 2.0 API to communicate with Azure Service Bus.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

   * Learn about Java Message Service (JMS) 2.0 and how to use it to interact with Azure Service Bus.
   * Write a Spring Boot application to send messages to Azure Service Bus.
   * Write a Spring Boot application to receive messages from Azure Service Bus.
   *
