In this exercise, you will use the Microsoft Authentication Library for Java (MSAL4J) to add authentication in a sample Java web application and enable users to sign in with their Azure Active Directory accounts.

The sample application used in this exercise is a Java servlet application that allows users to sign in and displays the user name and basic profile information. It also allows you to call the Microsoft Graph API to show some user information.

## Create a Java web application

From your shell or command line:

1. Create a folder for the application.

    ``` 
    mkdir ~/javawebapp
    ```

2. Clone the sample application from the GitHub repository into the new folder.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-java-servlet-webapp-authentication.git ~/javawebapp
    ```

3. Change into the folder where the sample application for this exercise is located.

    ```
    cd ~/javawebapp/2-Authorization-I/call-graph
    ```

## Configure the application

To configure the code, open the application project in your preferred IDE like IntelliJ or VS Code.

1. Open the `./src/main/resources/authentication.properties` file.

2. Find the string `{enter-your-tenant-id-here}`. Replace the existing value with the **Azure Active Directory tenant ID** (as shown in the image below), since the app was registered with the **Accounts in this organizational directory only** option.

3. Find the string `{enter-your-client-id-here}` and replace the existing value with the **application ID** (clientId) of the registered application copied from the Azure portal.

4. Find the string `{enter-your-client-secret-here}` and replace the existing value with the **key** you saved during the creation of the app in the Azure portal.

## Run the application

1. Make certain that your Tomcat server is running and you have privileges to deploy a web app to it. Make certain that your server host address is `http://localhost:8080`.

2. Compile and package the project using **Maven**:

    ```Shell
    cd ~/javawebapp/2-Authorization-I/call-graph
    mvn clean package
    ```

3. Find the resulting `.war` file in `./target/msal4j-servlet-graph.war`. To deploy to Tomcat, copy this `.war` file to the `/webapps/` directory in your Tomcat installation directory and start the Tomcat server.

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/msal4j-servlet-graph/`. You will be redirected to login with Azure Active Directory. On successful login, you should see a page as shown in the below image.

5. Click on the **ID Token Details** button to see some of the ID token's decoded claims.

## Overview of authentication code

Most of the authentication code in the sample application can be found under the `java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j/` directory of the project. It contains multiple servlets that provide the authentication endpoints in the application for sign in, sign out and handling the redirect callback from Azure Active Directory. These servlets use the helper classes in the directory `java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j/helpers/` to call the authentication methods provided by MSAL. There is a servlet filter defined in `AuthenticationFilter.java` which redirects unauthenticated requests to protected routes to a 401 unauthorized HTTP error page.
To add authentication to your application, you will need to include the servlet classes under `java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j/authservlets` and `java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j/authwebapp` directories, the helper classes in the directory `java/com/microsoft/azuresamples/msal4j/helpers/` and the authentication servlet filter `AuthenticationFilter.java` in your projects. Here are more details of the MSAL authentication code.
  
1. MSAL4J is available on Maven. You will need to add MSAL4J as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of the project.

    ```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
        <artifactId>msal4j</artifactId>
        <version>1.9.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

1. The first step of the sign-in process is to send a request to the `/authorize` endpoint of the Azure AD Tenant. The MSAL4J `ConfidentialClientApplication` instance is leveraged to construct an authorization request URL. The app redirects the browser to this URL, which is where the user will sign in.

    ```Java
    final ConfidentialClientApplication client = getConfidentialClientInstance();
    AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters parameters = AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters
                                                        .builder(Config.REDIRECT_URI, Collections.singleton(Config.SCOPES))
                                                        .responseMode(ResponseMode.QUERY).prompt(Prompt.SELECT_ACCOUNT).state(state).nonce(nonce).build();

    final String authorizeUrl = client.getAuthorizationRequestUrl(parameters).toString();
    contextAdapter.redirectUser(authorizeUrl);
    ```

    - **AuthorizationRequestUrlParameters**: Parameters that must be set in order to build an AuthorizationRequestUrl.
    - **REDIRECT_URI**: The redirect URI is the URI the identity provider will send the security tokens back to. Azure Active Directory will redirect the browser (along with auth code) to this URI after collecting user credentials. It must match the redirect URI in the Azure Active Directory app registration.
    - **SCOPES**: Scopes are permissions requested by the application. Normally, the three scopes `openid profile offline_access` suffice for receiving an ID token response for a user sign in and are set by default by MSAL.

1. The user is presented with a sign-in prompt by Azure Active Directory. If the sign-in attempt is successful, the user's browser is redirected to our app's redirect endpoint with a valid **authorization code** in the endpoint. The ConfidentialClientApplication instance then exchanges this authorization code for an ID Token and Access Token from Azure Active Directory.

    ```Java
    // First, validate the state, then parse any error codes in response, then extract the authCode. Then:
    // build the auth code params:
    final AuthorizationCodeParameters authParams = AuthorizationCodeParameters
                                                        .builder(authCode, new URI(Config.REDIRECT_URI)).scopes(Collections.singleton(Config.SCOPES)).build();

    // Get a client instance and leverage it to acquire the token:
    final ConfidentialClientApplication client = AuthHelper.getConfidentialClientInstance();
    final IAuthenticationResult result = client.acquireToken(authParams).get();
    ```

    - **AuthorizationCodeParameters**: Parameters that must be set in order to exchange the Authorization Code for an ID and/or access token.
    - **authCode**: The authorization code that was received at the redirect endpoint.
    - **REDIRECT_URI**: The redirect URI used in the previous step must be passed again.
    - **SCOPES**: The scopes used in the previous step must be passed again.

1. If `acquireToken` is successful, the token claims are extracted. If the nonce check passes, the results are placed in `context` (an instance of `IdentityContextData`) and saved to the session. The application can then instantiate this from the session (by way of an instance of `IdentityContextAdapterServlet`) whenever it needs access to it:

    ```Java
    // parse IdToken claims from the IAuthenticationResult:
    // (the next step - validateNonce - requires parsed claims)
    context.setIdTokenClaims(result.idToken());

    // if nonce is invalid, stop immediately! this could be a token replay!
    // if validation fails, throws exception and cancels auth:
    validateNonce(context);

    // set user to authenticated:
    context.setAuthResult(result, client.tokenCache().serialize());
    ```
