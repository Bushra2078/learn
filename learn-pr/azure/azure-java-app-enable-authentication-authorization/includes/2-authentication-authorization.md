Azure AD provides authentication and authorization service by supporting modern authentication protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in a standards-compliant way. This allows you to use open-source libraries such as Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and other standard-compliant libraries with Azure AD. Here is a brief summary of the distinction between authentication and authorization.

## Authentication

Authentication refers to the process of establishing and verifying the identity of the end-user who is accessing an application. Azure AD uses the OpenID Connect protocol to handle authentication. OpenID Connect allows applications to obtain basic information about the authenticated user and session.

## Authorization

Authorization is the process of ensuring that an authenticated user has the permission to perform some operation or access some data. The OAuth 2.0 protocol is used to provide authorization flows for different application in Azure AD.
