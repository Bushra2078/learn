  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What do you find in the selected area of the Microsoft Bonsai platform?"
    choices:
    - content: "A carousel with the Bonsai samples."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can select from the Bonsai samples offered in the Bonsai platform from this carousel."
    - content: "All the brains that have been created in your workspace and its versions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Names of the implemented brains and its versions are listed on the left side of the Bonsai UI."
    - content: "All the simulators available in your workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The available simulators are listed on the left side of the Bonsai UI."
    - content: "Exported brains."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exported brains are listed on the left side of the Bonsai UI."
  - content: "Select what the highlighted area represents in the authoring user interface of the Microsoft Bonsai platform:"
    choices:
    - content: "State space or sensors"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The state space is an input to the brain, because it needs to know the current state of the environment in the simulation before it can decide on an action."
    - content: "Control actions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Control actions would not be an input to the brain, nor are they outputs coming from the simulator. Control actions are the output of the brain."
    - content: "Module"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In this monolithic brain, the single module is synonymous with the brain itself."
    - content: "Goals"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Goals are hard-coded into the brain using Inkling, they would not be inputs to the brain, outputted from the simulator."
    - content: "Simulator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The highlighted area is the OUTPUT of the simulator. Don't confuse the simulator with the thing it outputs."
  - content: "Select what the highlighted area represents in the authoring user interface of the Microsoft Bonsai platform:"
    choices:
    - content: "State space or sensors"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The state space is an input to the brain, the four square dots at the top of the selected area."
    - content: "Control actions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Control actions are the output of the brain, the two square dots at the bottom of the selected area."
    - content: "Brain"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In this monolithic brain, the single module is synonymous with the brain itself."
    - content: "Goals"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Goals are hard-coded into the brain using Inkling, they are part of the brain."
    - content: "Simulator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The highlighted area is not the simulator."
  - content: "The Moab sample is a:"
    choices:
    - content: "Modular brain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A modular brain would have more than one module. MOAB only uses a single module, so it is not a modular brain."
    - content: "Hybrid brain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a term related to brain design patterns. It is called a hybrid brain when you combine one or more design patterns. It is not possible to create a hybrid between monolithic and modular brain, it needs to be one or the other."
    - content: "Monolithic brain"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Monolithic brains are characterized as having one module. Since MOAB only uses a single module it is monolithic."
    - content: "None of the above"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is a right answer above."
  - content: "What would happen if we change the goal “Move to center” by “Avoid the center”:"
    choices:
    - content: "It is an impossible task to learn, the brain will not converge."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is a region on the plate that the brain will learn to remain."
    - content: "The brain will constantly throw the ball off the plate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Off the plate is not the region that the brain will learn to remain with these two goals."
    - content: "The brain will keep the ball within a donut area between the center and the periphery of the plate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These two goals guide the brain to learn to remain in a donut of the plate."
    - content: "The brain will keep the ball in the periphery of the plate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. That is not the region that the brain will learn to remain with these two goals."
