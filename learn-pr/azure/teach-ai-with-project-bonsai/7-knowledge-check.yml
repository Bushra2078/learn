quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What do you find in the selected area of the Microsoft Bonsai platform?"
    choices:
    - content: "A carousel with the Bonsai samples."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can select from the Bonsai samples offered in the Bonsai platform from this carousel."
    - content: "All the brains that have been created in your workspace and its versions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Names of the implemented brains and its versions are listed on the left side of the Bonsai UI."
    - content: "All the simulators available in your workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The available simulators are listed on the left side of the Bonsai UI."
    - content: "Exported brains."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exported brains are listed on the left side of the Bonsai UI."
  - content: "The Moab sample is a:"
    choices:
    - content: "Modular brain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A modular brain would have more than one module. MOAB only uses a single module, so it isn't a modular brain."
    - content: "Hybrid brain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a term related to brain design patterns. It's called a hybrid brain when you combine one or more design patterns. It isn't possible to create a hybrid between monolithic and modular brain, it needs to be one or the other."
    - content: "Monolithic brain"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Monolithic brains are characterized as having one module. Since MOAB only uses a single module, it's monolithic."
    - content: "None of the above"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's a right answer above."
  - content: "What would happen if we change the goal “Move to center” by “Avoid the center”:"
    choices:
    - content: "It's an impossible task to learn, the brain won't converge."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's a region on the plate that the brain will learn to remain."
    - content: "The brain will constantly throw the ball off the plate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Off the plate isn't the region that the brain will learn to remain with these two goals."
    - content: "The brain will keep the ball within a donut area between the center and the periphery of the plate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These two goals guide the brain to learn to remain in a donut of the plate."
    - content: "The brain will keep the ball in the periphery of the plate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. That isn't the region that the brain will learn to remain with these two goals."
