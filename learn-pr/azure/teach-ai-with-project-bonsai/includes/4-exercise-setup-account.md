2. Then, sign in to your account or click "Create one!" if you need to create an account.

3. Grant Bonsai access to your account if prompted.

## Enable Azure cloud services

1. When you sign in for the first time, the Bonsai UI looks for a valid Azure subscription. If you need an Azure services subscription, click the Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) button and follow the prompts to sign up for an Azure free trial. You can use the free trial for 12 months.

2. If you already have a valid Azure subscription but haven't created a Bonsai workspace, the UI will prompt you to visit the Azure portal and create a workspace. Otherwise, you'll be automatically directed to the Azure portal after subscription sign-up.

## Provision of a Bonsai workspace

After signing in to the Azure portal, you must provision a Bonsai workspace as a resource.

1. Search for "Bonsai" in the Marketplace and click on Bonsai service.

2. Click Create Bonsai to open the Create Bonsai page and provide the following information.

    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
    - **Resource group**: Select your resource group or create a new resource group if you don't have one.
    - **Name**: Enter a name for the Bonsai workspace
    - **Location**: Select your location.

3. Click Review + create and confirm the listed information is correct to complete your deployment. Note that Bonsai will provision the following resources:

    - **Azure Container Registry** (basic tier) for storing exported brains and instanced simulations.
    - **Azure Container Instances** for running simulations.
    - **Azure Storage** for storing uploaded simulators as zip files.

4. When provisioning completes, open the Bonsai UI and select your subscription and workspace from the available dropdowns to complete setup.
