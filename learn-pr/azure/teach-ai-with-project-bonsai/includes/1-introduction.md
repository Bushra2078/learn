An innovation leader of an engineering team is looking for new ways to optimize machines, production lines or processes, reduce waste or energy consumption. He has heard of the benefits of Autonomous AI using Machine Teaching for industrial applications and wants to explore it for different challenges at their plant.

His team engineers have subject matter expertise that he can capture to train autonomous systems. After going through the Bonsai overview, the engineers can use Machine Teaching to design Autonomous AI brains to solve high-value industrial challenges. Additionally, they can select winning use cases and write their corresponding AI specification document that includes all essential aspects to communicate with subject matter experts, business owners, and Machine Teaching engineers.

For the team to learn and practice the concepts of Machine Teaching, and the Bonsai platform, they get their hands on the Moab device which shows the Bonsai workflow from beginning to end. In addition, the device/platform can illustrate the mechanism of bridging the gap between how humans learn and how AI learns.

Through a combination of Project Bonsai and Project Moab, any engineer is able to understand how an Autonomous AI brain learns. This understanding accelerates the design of autonomous systems based on intelligent control mechanisms using Project Bonsai.
