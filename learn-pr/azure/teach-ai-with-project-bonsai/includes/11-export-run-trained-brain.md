Now that you've successfully trained a brain to balance the ball and get a good result for brain performance, you're ready to deploy the AI brain in the real world. To extract the value of Autonomous AI brains, it's essential to be able to seamlessly deploy them into the production environment.

When your training is completed, you'll export your trained Brain. Exported brains are docker containers. You'll use the function of exported brain as a containerized service that can run anywhere Docker is installed, including your local machine.

After you train and export the Brain, you're ready for deployment. The options available include deploying on-premises, in the cloud, to the IoT Edge, or in embedded devices. Currently, Bonsai supports two main paths for deployment:

- ACR deployment
- IoT integration

In this module, we'll be focusing in ACR deployment.
