So far, you have explored Bonsai UI and Visual Authoring with the Moab sample. The default Inkling file we just reviewed is translated into the brain design from the Moab AI Spec document into the Bonsai platform. Thus far, you have seen the relationship between AI spec and Moab brain.

These are the overall steps to train a Bonsai brain and evaluate the training progress. Implementation of the steps will be explained in the next unit.

1. Begin training
    a. Explore the training performance chart
    b. Explore the brain graph
    c. Explore simulation visualization
2. Evaluate training progress
3. Export and deploy your Brain

By the end of the module, you'll have a trained Bonsai brain. If you have a physical Moab device, you could export your trained Brain and deploy it to the device.
