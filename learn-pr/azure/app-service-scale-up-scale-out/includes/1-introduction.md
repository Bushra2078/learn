The ability to scale a web app is important for the following reasons:

- It enables the web app to remain responsive during periods of high demand.
- It helps to lower costs by reducing the resources required when demand drops.

Azure App Service enables you to meet these goals by providing scale up and down, and scale in and out.

Imagine that you work for a large chain of hotels. You have a web site that customers can visit to make bookings, and retrieve the details of bookings that they have previously made. At certain times of the year, the volume of traffic grows considerably as customers are browsing hotels for summer vacations. At other times, traffic declines. These patterns are predictable.

In this module, you'll use Azure App Service to scale a web app to match planned seasonal throughput requirements, and also meet demand during short-term peak events. This module also describes how to scale up a web app onto more powerful hardware to meet future requirements.
