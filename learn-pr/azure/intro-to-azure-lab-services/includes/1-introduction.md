You can use Azure Lab Services to create and manage classroom lab environments in the cloud. The service provides a virtual desktop environment with a virtual machine behind it. You can use Azure Lab Services for classes such as cybersecurity, machine learning, programming, network and systems administration, data sciences, and media and the arts. You can also use the service for various non-classroom scenarios such as Hackathons.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for an educational institution. You deliver classes on cybersecurity and data sciences software. Also, you provide practice environments after each class, where students develop and test code to consolidate their learning. Both classes and practice environments are currently hosted in your on-premises classrooms. You want to migrate these systems into the cloud.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, weâ€™ll analyze the capabilities of Azure Lab Services to help you decide when to use it:

- Lab plans to apply policies across labs and assign role-based permissions.
- Labs consisting of Windows or Linux-based virtual machines and assigned to users (students).
- Schedules and quotas to manage users and limit costs.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to evaluate whether Azure Lab Services is appropriate to your lab requirements.
