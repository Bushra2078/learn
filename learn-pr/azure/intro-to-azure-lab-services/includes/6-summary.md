In your educational institution, you wanted to host both classroom and learning environments in the cloud. Because you needed to minimize the management time for classrooms, you chose Azure Lab Services to host environments used in instructor-led training. For the learning environments, you wanted to use Azure Pipelines for regular updated software builds, so you selected Azure DevTest Labs. 

It's possible to host lab environments in Azure using only virtual machines. You could, for example, create classrooms using Resource Manager templates. However, with Azure Lab Services, many administration tasks associated with classroom environments are automated. You can run classes with the minimum of work.
