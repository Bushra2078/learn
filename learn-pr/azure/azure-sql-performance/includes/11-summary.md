In this module you did learned about the performance capabilities of Azure SQL compared to SQL Server. You also learned fundamental performance tasks such as configuration and maintenance.

Monitoring and troubleshooting are important so in this module you learned the various methods and tools to monitor and troubleshoot performance with hands-on activities for a CPU scaling scenario. You then learned how to improving CPU scaling for your workload without any migration required for your database. Improving application performance does not always require a new scale in Azure so you learned a common performance bottleneck scenario that you improved by tuning the query workload.

Finally you learned the unique capabilities of Intelligent Performance in Azure SQL including a bonus hands-on activity to see how Automatic Tuning for indexes work in Azure SQL.

Keep in mind the following key points about Azure SQL Performance:

Fixed capacities to choose from for CPU, memory, and I/O.
Tools exist like DMVs and Extended Events like SQL Server.
Query Store on by default and powers query tuning.
New Azure functionality exists to replace existing functionality like Azure Metrics.
DMVs exist that are new and designed for Azure.
New wait types exist specific to Azure.
Resource governance is specific to Azure.
Scale up and down without need to migrate.
Intelligent Performance to get faster with no code changes.
