You've been responsible for getting your SQL Server fast, keeping it fast, and making it fast again when something is wrong. In this module, we'll show you how to leverage your existing performance skills, processes, and tools and apply them to Azure SQL, including taking advantage of the intelligence in Azure to deliver consistent performance for your application.

This is the fourth module of the Azure SQL Fundamentals learning path. The recommendation is to complete the first three modules before continuing.

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Identify and use the performance capabilities of Azure SQL
- Configure and maintain performance for Azure SQL
- Monitor and troubleshoot performance in Azure SQL
- Accelerate and tune performance in Azure SQL
- Improve performance with Intelligent Performance

## Prerequisites for exercises

A sandbox environment is provided for you to deploy Azure resources. However, you do need to do a few things on your local machine to complete the exercises:

- Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)
- Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true)
- Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?azure-portal=true)
- Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access lab files.
- Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.  

If you cannot complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
