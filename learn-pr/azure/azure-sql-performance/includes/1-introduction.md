You've been responsible for getting your SQL Server fast, keeping it fast, and making it fast again when something is wrong. In this module, we'll show you how to leverage your existing performance skills, processes, and tools and apply them to Azure SQL, including taking advantage of the intelligence in Azure to keep your database tuned.

This is the fourth module of the Azure SQL Fundamentals learning path. The recommendation is to complete the Azure SQL introduction module before continuing.

Throughout the exercises, it's important to also read the accompanying text to the steps, but know that you can always come back to this page to review what you did at a later time.

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand what are the Azure SQL performance capabilities<br>
- Configure and Maintain for Performance<br>
- Monitor and troubleshoot performance in Azure SQL<br>
- Accelerate and Tune Performance in Azure SQL<br>
- Improve performance with Intelligent Performance<br>

### Prerequisites for exercises

If you intend to complete the exercises (recommended), a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, you do need to do a few things on your local machine to complete the exercises:

- Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)
- Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals) to access lab files. 
- Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.  

If you cannot complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
