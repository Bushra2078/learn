In this exercise, you will take the problem you encountered in the first exercise and improve performance by scaling more CPUs for Azure SQL Database. You will use the database you deployed in the previous exercise.

All scripts for this exercise can be found in the folder *04-Performance\monitor_and_scale* in the GitHub repository or zip file you downloaded.

## Scale up Azure SQL performance

To scale performance for a problem that appears to be a CPU capacity problem, you should decide what your options are and then proceed to scale CPUs using provided interfaces for Azure SQL.

1. Decide options on how to scale performance. Since the workload is CPU *bound*, one way to improve performance is to increase CPU capacity or speed. A SQL Server user would have to move to a different machine or reconfigure a VM to get more CPU capacity. In some cases, even a SQL Server administrator may not have permission to make these scaling changes, the process could take time, and even require a database migration.
  
    For Azure, we can use ALTER DATABASE, Azure CLI, or the portal to increase CPU capacity with no database migration on the part of the user.
  
1. Using the Azure portal we can see options for how you can scale for more CPU resources. Using the Overview blade for the database, select the Pricing tier current deployment. The Pricing tier allows you to change the service tier and number of vCores.

1. Here you can see options for changing or scaling compute resources. For General Purpose, you can easily scale up to something like 8 vCores.
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-azure-portal-compute-options.png" alt-text="Azure_Portal_Compute_Options":::
  
    Instead of using the portal, I'll show you a different method to scale your workload.

1. For this exercise, so that we can see proper differences in reports, you must first flush the query store. In SSMS click on the AdventureWorks database and use the File/Open menu to open the script in SSMS **flushhquerystore.sql** in the context of the AdventureWorks database. Your query editor window should look like the following text:
  
    ```sql
    EXEC sp_query_store_flush_db;
    ```

    Execute this T-SQL batch.

1. Open the script  **get_service_objective.sql** in SSMS. Your query editor window should look like the following text:

    ```sql
    SELECT database_name,slo_name,cpu_limit,max_db_memory, max_db_max_size_in_mb, primary_max_log_rate,primary_group_max_io, volume_local_iops,volume_pfs_iops
    FROM sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance;
    GO
    SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX('AdventureWorks', 'ServiceObjective');
    GO
    ```

    This is a method to find out your service tier using T-SQL. The Pricing or service tier is also known as a *service objective*. Execute the T-SQL batches.
  
    For the current Azure SQL Database deployment, your results should look like the following image:
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-service-objective-results.png" alt-text="service_objective_results":::
  
    Notice the term **slo_name** is also used for service objective. The term **slo** stands for *service level objective*.
  
    The various slo_name values are not documented but you can see from the string value this database uses a General Purpose service tier with 2 vCores:

    > [!NOTE]
    > SQLDB_OP_... is the string used for Business Critical.

    When you view the ALTER DATABASE documentation, notice the ability to click on your target SQL Server deployment to get the right syntax options. Click on SQL Database single database/elastic pool to see the options for Azure SQL Database. To match the compute scale you found in the portal, you need the service objective **'GP_Gen5_8'**.

1. Modify the service objective for the database to scale more CPUs. Open the script **modify_service_objective.sql** in SSMS and execute the T-SQL batch. Your query editor window should look like the following text:
  
    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks MODIFY (SERVICE_OBJECTIVE = 'GP_Gen5_8');
    ```
  
    This statement comes back immediately but the scaling of the compute resources takes place in the background. A scale this small should take less than a minute and for a short period of time the database will be offline to make the change effective. You can monitor the progress of this scaling activity using the Azure portal.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-azure-portal-update-progress.png" alt-text="Azure_Portal_Update_In_Progress":::

1. Right click the master database in Object Explorer under the System Databases folder and select New Query. Run this query in the SSMS query editor window:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_operation_status;
    ```

    This is another way to monitor the progress of a change for the service objective for Azure SQL Database. This DMV exposes a history of changes to the database with ALTER DATABASE to the service objective and will show active progress of the change.

    Here is an example of the output of this DMV after executing the above ALTER DATABASE statement:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>session_activity_id</th>
        <th>resource_type</th>
        <th>resource_type_desc</th>
        <th>major_resource_id</th>
        <th>minor_resource_id</th>
        <th>operation</th>
        <th>state</th>
        <th>state_desc</th>
        <th>percent_complete</th>
        <th>error_code</th>
        <th>error_desc</th>
        <th>error_severity</th>
        <th>error_state</th>
        <th>start_time</th>
        <th>last_modify_time</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>97F9474C-0334-4FC5-BFD5-337CDD1F9A21</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>Database</td>
        <td>AdventureWorks</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>ALTER DATABASE</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>IN_PROGRESS</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>[date time]</td>
        <td>[date time]</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    During a change for the service objective, queries are allowed against the database until the final change is implemented so an application cannot connect for a very brief period of time. For Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, a change of tier will allow queries and connections but prevents all database operations like creation of new databases (in these cases operations like these will fail with the error message "**The operation could not be completed because a service tier change is in progress for managed instance '[server]' Please wait for the operation in progress to complete and try again**")

1. When this is done use the queries listed above from **get_service_objective.sql** in SSMS to verify the new service objective or service tier of 8 vCores has taken affect.

## Run the workload after scale up

Now that the database has more CPU capacity, let's run the workload we did in the previous exercise to observe whether there is a performance improvement.

1. Now that the scaling has complete, we need to see if the workload duration is faster and whether waits on CPU resources has decreased. Run the workload again using the command **sqlworkload.cmd** that you executed in the previous exercise.

1. Using SSMS, execute the same query from the first exercise of this module to observe results from the script **dmdbresourcestats.sql**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_db_resource_stats;
    ```

    You should see the average cpu resource usage has dropped lower from the almost 100% usage in the previous exercise.

1. Using SSMS, execute the same query from the first exercise of this module from the script **dmexecrequests.sql**.

    ```sql
    SELECT er.session_id, er.status, er.command, er.wait_type, er.last_wait_type, er.wait_resource, er.wait_time
    FROM sys.dm_exec_requests er
    INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions es
    ON er.session_id = es.session_id
    AND es.is_user_process = 1;
    ```

    You will see there are more queries with a status of RUNNING (less RUNNABLE although this will appear some). This means our workers have more CPU capacity to execute.

1. Observe the new workload duration. The workload duration from **sqlworkload.cmd** should now be much less and somewhere ~25-30 seconds.

## Observe Query Store reports

Let's look at the same Query Store reports as we did in the previous exercise.

1. Using the same techniques as the first exercise in this module, look at the **Top Resource Consuming Queries** report from SSMS:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-ssms-top-query-faster.png" alt-text="SSMS_QDS_Top_Query_Faster":::

    You will now see two queries (query_id). These are the same query but show up as different query_id values in Query Store because the scale operation required a restart so the query had to be recompiled. You can see in the report the overall and average duration was significantly less.

1. Look also at the **Query Wait Statistics** report as you did in the previous exercise. You can see the overall average wait time for the query is less and a lower % of the overall duration. This is good indication that CPU is not as much of a resource bottleneck when the database had a lower number of vCores:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-ssms-top-wait-stats-query-faster.png" alt-text="SSMS_Top_Wait_Stats_Query_Faster":::

1. You can close out all reports and query editor windows but leave SSMS connected as you will need this in the next exercise.

## Observe changes from Azure Metrics

1. Navigate to the AdventureWorks database in the Azure portal and look at the Overview blade again for the Compute Utilization:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-azure-portal-compute-query-comparison.png" alt-text="Azure_Portal_Compute_Query_Comparison.png":::

    Notice the duration is shorter for high CPU utilization which means an overall drop in CPU resources required to run the workload.

1. This chart can be somewhat misleading. If you use Azure Metrics from the Resource menu and do a CPU comparison the chart looks more like

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-azure-metrics-query-comparison.png" alt-text="Azure_Metrics_Compute_Query_Comparison.png":::

> [!TIP]
> If you continue to increase vCores for this database you can improve performance up to a threshold where all queries have plenty of CPU resources. This does not mean you must match the number of vCores to the number of concurrent users from your workload. In addition, you can change the Pricing Tier to use **Serverless** *Compute Tier* instead of **Provisioned** to achieve a more "auto-scaled" approach to a workload. For example, for this workload if you chose a min vCore value of 2 and max vCore value of 8, this workload would immediately scale to 8 vCores.

You will now go through another exercise where you observe a performance problem and resolve it by applying best practices for application performance.
