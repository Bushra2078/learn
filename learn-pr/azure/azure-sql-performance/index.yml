  For the exercises, a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, you need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

  - Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)  
  - Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true)
  - Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?azure-portal=true)
  - Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises. iconUrl: /learn/achievements/azure-sql-performance.svg
