Visual Studio Code is the preferred code editor for many software developers around the world due to it's features and extensible architecture.  Git is the preferred source code management tool used by most open source projects and large corporations due to it's flexibility and distributed nature.  Visual Studio Code provides tight source control integration with Git by default, both accellerating developers' git workflows and providing rich feedback at a glance to understand the state of the source code.

Imagine you want to make a contribution to an open source project hosted on GitHub.  You would need to get a local copy of the code, create a branch for your changes, edit source code files and push your changes to your forked repository hosted online, then create a pull request to the open source project's manager.  While all of this could be performed using two separate tools, such as Visual Studio Code and Git Bash and a lot of typing, you can also accomplish many of these common tasks directly from within Visual Studio Code with less typing and more clarity.

In this module, you'll use Visual Studio Code's tight integration with Git to obtain a local clone, create a branch, make changes to source code files, stage changes and push those changes to your fork -- all without leaving Visual Studio Code.  You'll learn about the ways Visual Studio Code provides at-a-glance feedback to help you understand the state of your code.  You'll use special views to stage and unstage changes, and create commits with detailed messages.  Finally, you'll use short cuts to access functionality to perform tasks like pushing your changes to GitHub.

By the end of this module, you will have mastered your use of Git inside of Visual Studio Code.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:
- Utilize Visual Studio Code's Command Pallet to perform many Git tasks like cloning repositories and creating branches
- Take visual cues from Visual Studio Code to understand the status of your work
- Harness Visual Studio Code's Source Control view to stage and unstage changes and create commits
- Uncover numerous time saving short cuts tucked into the Visual Studio Code user interface

## Prerequisites

- You must have Git installed.
- You must have Visual Studio Code installed.
- You should have a basic understanding of Git concepts and commands, such as working with repositories, forks, clones, branches, staged and unstaged changes, commits, and pushing commits.
- You will need a GitHub account.
