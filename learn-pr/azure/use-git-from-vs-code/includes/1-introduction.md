The features and extensible architecture of  Visual Studio Code make it the preferred code editor for many software developers around the world. And the flexibility and distributed nature of Git make it the preferred source-code management tool for most open-source projects and large corporations.  Visual Studio Code provides tight source control integration with Git by default, both accelerating developers' Git workflows and providing rich feedback at a glance to help them understand the state of the source code.

Imagine that you want to contribute to an open-source project that's hosted on GitHub.  Ordinarily, you need to get a local copy of the code, create a branch for your changes, edit the source code files, push your changes to your forked repository hosted online, and then create a pull request to the open-source project's manager.  Although you could perform these source control activities by using two separate tools, such as Visual Studio Code and Git Bash, you can do these common tasks directly from within Visual Studio Code with less typing and more clarity.

In this module, you'll use the tight integration of Visual Studio Code with Git to obtain a local clone, create a branch, change source code files, stage those changes, and push them to your fork, all without leaving Visual Studio Code.  You'll learn how Visual Studio Code provides at-a-glance feedback that can help you understand the state of your code.  You'll use special views to stage your changes, unstage them, and create commits with detailed messages.  Finally, you'll learn shortcuts to performing key tasks, such as pushing your changes to GitHub.

By the end of this module, you will have mastered your use of Git inside of Visual Studio Code.
