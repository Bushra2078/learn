Our goal was to exercise Visual Studio Code's Git tools by simulating a contribution to an open-source project.

Utilizing Visual Studio Code's Git tools, we cloned a remote repository to our local machine, created a branch, made changes, staged those changes and create a commit with a message, then pushed our changes back to the remote repository all without leaving Visual Studio Code!

Without tight integration with Git, Visual Studio Code would still be a powerful editor.  You would need an additional tool to help manage your changes in source control, or type git commands from the integrated Terminal.  However, if you learn to harness the Git tools, you can accelerate your source control activities from within Visual Studio Code.
