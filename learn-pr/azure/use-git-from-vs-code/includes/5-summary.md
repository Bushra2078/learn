Our goal in this module was to exercise Visual Studio Code's built-in Git functionality by simulating a contribution to an open-source project.

By taking advantage of the Git tools in Visual Studio Code, you cloned a remote repository to your local machine, created a branch, made changes, staged those changes, created a commit with a message, and then pushed your changes back to the remote repository. And you did all this without leaving Visual Studio Code!

Without such tight integration with Git, Visual Studio Code would still be a powerful editor.  You would need an additional tool to help manage your changes in source control, or type Git commands from the integrated terminal. If you continue to learn how to harness the Git tools, you can accelerate your source-control activities from within Visual Studio Code.
