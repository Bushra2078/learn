quiz:

  questions:
  
  - content: "The image has six network segments allocated across two sites and zones. If site 2 has two network segments with the same IP addresses from different production lines, how many zones should you have between the two sites?"
    choices:
    - content: "1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sites are divided into zones. One site could have one zone but it may not be shared across two sites."
    - content: "2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Site 1 may have one zone. However, Site 2 shouldn't have one zone or devices with recurring IP addresses may be consolidated incorrectly, and are identified as separate and unique devices in the device inventory."
    - content: "3"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Site 1 can have one zone. Site 2 should be separated into two zones. That way devices in the segments with recurring IP addresses can consolidate correctly, and are identified as separate and unique devices in the device inventory."

  - content: "What Zero Trust solutions does Defender for IoT take for OT environments?"
    choices:
    - content: "OT security takes advantage of general Zero Trust security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "OT security relies on Zero Trust procedures of its own."
    - content: "Defender for IoT supports Zero Trust access segmentation with sites and zones."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Defender for IoT supports Zero Trust with sites and zones, among other security strategies."
    - content: "OT security uses Endpoint behavioral sensors for Zero Trust security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "OT security relies on Zero Trust procedures of its own."
