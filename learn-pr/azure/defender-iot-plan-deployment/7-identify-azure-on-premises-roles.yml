quiz:

  questions:
  
  - content: "What role should be assigned to a team member reviewing sensor data but not making any changes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Security Reader"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Security Reader role is the right level of access for a team member who only needs read-access to sensor data."
    - content: "Security Admin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Zero Trust least-priviledged access idea suggests that Security Admin permissions are too high for someone who needs only read access to the sensor data."
    - content: "Admin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Zero Trust least-priviledged access idea suggests that Security Admin permissions are too high for someone who needs only read access to the sensor data."

  - content: "Suppose you have a group of users who are onboarding OT sensors. What Active Directory group could you assign them to?"
    choices:
    - content: "OT Security Reader" 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An OT Security Reader group presumably has read-only access to sensor data, which isn't enough to onboard OT sensors."
    - content: "OT Security Admin"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An OT Security Admin group has sensor onboarding permissions but still has permission limits."
    - content: "OT Owner"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An OT Owner group presumably has all permissions and can create users. Creating users exceeds the permissions needed by the onboarding users."
