## Summary

This course provides the user an understanding of developing the mixed reality application with Stereokit. StereoKit is basically a code-first library aimed particularly at engineers and others using Visual Studio and NuGet's extensive functionality.

Stereokit is better fit for people developing more traditional applications. unlike game engines, StereoKit's asset pipeline operates at runtime rather than build time allowing faster computation.
