StereoKit is an easy-to-use open-source mixed reality library for building HoloLens and VR applications using C# and OpenXR.

StereoKit is the collection of tools that allows you to build Mixed Reality applications. However, physics, user interface are some challenging problems and we require game engines to access them; thus, the main objective of StereoKit is to create a comfortable environment for developers.

In this module, you'll learn how to configure, install the visual studio community and StereoKit's Visual studio template into your application or project.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to set up, create, build an application and work across OpenXR platforms like HoloLens 2, Windows Mixed Reality, Monado Linux and so on.

## Learning objectives

* Configure visual studio to develop the Mixed Reality application using Steoreokit.

* To Integrate the simplified finger-painting sample application.

* To build and test the applications in Desktop and in HoloLens 2.

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2019 - the Community version.

* StereoKitâ€™s Visual Studio Template.

* Any OpenXR platforms: Windows MR, Oculus, SteamVR, Varjo, Monado, HoloLens or an Oculus Quest.
