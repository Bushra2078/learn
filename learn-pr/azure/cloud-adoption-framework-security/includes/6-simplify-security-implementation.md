Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) are a logical construct that captures everything that must be true to enable application migrations and development at scale in Azure. Landing zones consider all platform resources that are required to support a customer's application portfolio. Azure landing zones provide cloud adoption teams with a well-managed environment for their workloads.

Landing zones help with cloud adoption by creating better ways to organize resources, not just by type, but by organization, cost, and security.

When designing and implementing an Azure Landing Zone, security should be a consideration throughout the process. The security design area focuses on considerations and recommendations for landing zone decisions. Azure Security Benchmarks are built into Azure Landing Zones to make adopting a strong security stance easier.  

The security design area creates a foundation for security across Azure, hybrid, and multicloud environments. The design considerations for security within the Azure Landing Zones focus on providing visibility into what's happening within the technical cloud estate. Security monitoring and audit logging of Azure platform services is a key component of a scalable framework. The security operations design considerations have in scope Security alerts, Security logs, Security controls, Vulnerability management, Shared responsibilities, and Encryption and keys. The foundation can later be enhanced with security guidance outlined in the CAF Secure methodology.

Continue to learn about implementation options for Azure landing zones by reviewing the best practices in the [Ready methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) of the Cloud Adoption Framework. Those practices help you to choose how and when to refactor your landing zone to better fit your needs.

## Security implementation best practices

There are several key steps that can help mitigate or avoid the business risk from cybersecurity attacks and help you rapidly establish essential security practices in the cloud and integrate security into your cloud adoption process. Adhering to these steps will help you integrate security at critical points in the process. The goal is to avoid obstacles in cloud adoption and reduce unnecessary business or operational disruption.

These steps include:

- Establish essential security practices
- Modernize the security strategy
- Develop a security plan
- Secure new workloads
- Secure existing cloud workloads
- Govern to manage and improve security posture

This [getting started guide](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/security) outlines the key steps in detail and can help you rapidly establish essential security practices in the cloud and integrate security into your cloud adoption process.
