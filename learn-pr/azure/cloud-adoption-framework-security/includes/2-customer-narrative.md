In earlier Microsoft Learn modules for the Cloud Adoption Framework, we shared the narrative of Tailwind Traders. This module is the next step toward Tailwind's cloud adoption journey. The Tailwind team is evaluating its security posture.

The Tailwind Traders innovation team is rapidly deploying new products and services and migrating out of their data centers. The company's CISO is concerned that the company's risk profile is growing quickly and has become larger than originally anticipated. The company has not yet encountered a breach, but the CISO recognizes that it's only a matter of time now that adoption is ramping up quickly.

Tailwind Traders previously completed the [CAF Ready](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/) module, but the company wants to be proactive to prevent future security issues. They also want to operationalize security practices across their portfolio to improve their overall security posture. As pointed out in previous Tailwind Traders narratives, the company chose a "Start Small" implementation of Azure Landing Zones. This means they don't have all the rich security tools that come with the Azure Landing Zone Accelerator. (Note: If Tailwind Traders had deployed Azure Landing Zones at an enterprise scale from the beginning, they'd already have many of these tools in place, which would accelerate their security journey.)

The CISO wants to add proper layers of protection to reduce risk and prepare for inevitable breach situations.

She wants to:

**Reduce risk from major incidents.**  
The CISO wants to prevent as many incidents as possible, limit the damage of successful attacks, and rapidly detect, respond to, and recover from incidents. She also wants to be able to restore business processes without paying a ransom.

**Identify and protect sensitive business data.**  
The CISO wants to clearly identify what business assets are important to the organization, map those into technical assets, and protect those assets appropriately whether they are structured data, unstructured data, or any types of applications/systems that enable business critical processes.

**Rapidly modernize her existing security program.**  
The CISO wants to modernize her security program with well-planned initiatives that prioritize quick wins and incremental progress across all security disciplines.  

**Show the company has a strong security posture to build confidence with employees, partners, customers, and stakeholders.**  
The CISO wants to provide the right level of details on Tailwind Trader's security posture to organization leadership, oversight, and business partners. She wants to carefully balance the ability to provide enough information to build trust while limiting risk from disclosing too much data.  

**Proactively meet regulatory and compliance requirements.**  
The CISO wants to rapidly discover, understand, meet, and report compliance with external requirements.  

**Reduce the cost and complexity of doing business.**  
The CISO wants to simplify security processes and reduce friction in business processes from security by modernizing workloads and applying modern security intelligence, automation, monitoring, and defense approaches.  

Finally, the CISO also wants to gain insights into the company's security posture that will help build confidence and help the company prioritize what work needs to be done next; empower people (employees, contractors, business partners) to do their job securely from anywhere; and ensure monitoring and policy enforcement for all access to the organization's resources (a full end-to-end lifecycle approach).

The CISO has decided to add a series of tools, controls, architectures, security operations, and administration practices to improve the security posture of Tailwind Traders' cloud implementations.
