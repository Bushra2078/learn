The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework Secure methodology provides a vision of the complete end state to guide the improvement of your security program over time. The Cloud Adoption Framework Secure methodology provides a bridge between your business digital transformation and your security program and strategy. It also provides structured guidance for modernizing your security disciplines. 

Watch the following video to learn more about the Secure methodology and how it helps guide continuing security improvements over time.

The following infographic provides a visual mapping of the key ways security integrates with the larger organization and the disciplines within security.

## Business alignment

Your security program should focus heavily on business alignment in three categories:

- **Risk insights**: Align and integrate security insights and risk signals/sources to the business initiatives. Ensure repeatable processes educate all teams on the application of those insights and hold teams accountable for improvements.
- **Security integration**: Integrate security knowledge, skills, and insights deeper into daily operations of the business and IT environment via repeatable processes and deep partnership at all levels of the organization.
- **Business Resilience**: Focus organizational resilience by preventing as many attacks as possible, limiting the damage of those attacks, ensuring you can continue operations during an attack (even if at a degraded state), and ensuring the organization rapidly bounces back to full operations.

## Security disciplines

Cloud migration will affect each security discipline differently. Each of these disciplines is extremely important and requires continuous investment and continuous improvement as you adopt the cloud:

- **Access control**: Application of network and identity create access boundaries and segmentation to reduce the frequency and reach of any security breaches.
- **Security operations**: Monitor IT operations to detect, respond, and recover from a breach. Use data to continuously reduce risk of breach.
- **Asset protection**: Maximize protection of all assets (infrastructure, devices, data, applications, networks, and identities) to minimize risk to the overall environment.
- **Security governance**: Monitor decisions, configurations, and data to govern decisions made across the environment and within all workloads across the portfolio.
- **Innovation security**: Integrate security into your DevOps models to increase the security and safety assurances as you increase the pace of innovation in your organization. To avoid expensive security incidents and late-stage mitigations, security must become an integral part of a DevSecOps process where workload teams are empowered to quickly identify and mitigate security risks.
