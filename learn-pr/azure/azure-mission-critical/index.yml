title: Challenge Project - Design a mission-critical workload
summary: |
  You want to design a highly reliable, available, and resilient workload that uses Azure capabilities. The architecture is for an example workload for a fictitious company. You'll start with an existing architecture, given the high-level specifications, design principles, example solutions to complete the project.
  > [!NOTE]
  > This module is a **_Challenge Project_** module where you complete an end-to-end project using high-level guidance; there are no step-by-step instructions for the actual implementation. A recommended approach is given for each exercise to make sure you're aligned with the specification of the target architecture.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll demonstrate your ability to:
   - Extend the current application to have a new API for health checks
   - Define key strategies for multi-region deployment
   - Design an overall health model
prerequisites: |
  - Experience designing a workload that includes core infrastructure technology such as data storage, compute, and networking
  - Experience designing a workload that's deployed to multiple regions
  - Good understanding of the design principles and design areas of a mission-critical workload provided in the Azure Well-Architected Framework
