The key to the success of the application lies in its user interface. it's the first layer of the encounter between your application and the user; creating a good impact through the user interface will help outreach your application. In this module

Suppose say you're working at a tech company in the UI/UX designing team. Your company is planning to launch a holographic application. Your job is to improve the application's user experience by providing components that will assist the user in better interaction with the holograms.

This module shows you how to build a mixed reality user experience with MRTK using NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover hologram model. Here, you'll:

* Create a simple user interface using MRTK's button and menu prefabs.
* Add dynamic tooltip UI elements.
* Add bounds control around 3D objects

By the end of the module, you can add UI elements to your project using MRTK.
