Previously, we used multiple if statements to implement the rules of our game.  However, when we left off in the previous unit, there was opportunity for improvement -- improvement to the expressiveness of the code, and improvement to fix a subtle bug in our code.  We'll use variants of the if statement to improve our code.

## Step 1 - Use the if-else statement instead of two separate if statements

Instead of performing two checks to display the "You win!" or "Sorry, you lose" message, we'll use the `else` keyword.  Modify your code to match the following code listing:

```csharp-interactive
Random dice = new Random();

int roll1 = dice.Next(1, 7);
int roll2 = dice.Next(1, 7);
int roll3 = dice.Next(1, 7);

int total = roll1 + roll2 + roll3;

Console.WriteLine($"Dice roll: {roll1} + {roll2} + {roll3} = {total}");

if ((roll1 == roll2) || (roll2 == roll3) || (roll1 == roll3))
{
    Console.WriteLine("You rolled doubles!  +2 bonus to total!");
    total += 2;
}

if ((roll1 == roll2) && (roll2 == roll3))
{
    Console.WriteLine("You rolled triples!  +6 bonus to total!");
    total += 6;
}

if (total >= 15)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You win!");
}
else 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Sorry, you lose.");
}
```

Here, if `total >= 15` is false, then the code block below the `else` keyword will execute.  Since these two options are related opposites, this is a perfect scenario for the `else` keyword.

## Step 2 - Modify the code to remove the stacking bonus for doubles and triples using nesting.

In the previous unit, we saw how we introduced a subtle logic bug into our application.  Let's fix that using nesting.  

Nesting allows us to place code blocks inside of code blocks.  In this case, we'll nest an if-else statement (the check for triples) inside of another if statement (the check for doubles) to prevent them both from happening.

We'll nest the check for triples inside of the check for doubles.  Modify the code to match the following code listing:

```
int roll1 = 6;
int roll2 = 6;
int roll3 = 6;

int total = roll1 + roll2 + roll3;

Console.WriteLine($"Dice roll: {roll1} + {roll2} + {roll3} = {total}");

if ((roll1 == roll2) || (roll2 == roll3) || (roll1 == roll3))
{
    if ((roll1 == roll2) && (roll2 == roll3))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You rolled triples!  +6 bonus to total!");
        total += 6;
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You rolled doubles!  +2 bonus to total!");
        total += 2;
    }
}

if (total >= 15)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You win!");
}
else 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Sorry, you lose.");
}
```

To test the code without having to run the application dozens of times, you can temporarily hardcode the values of the three roll variables by adding the following code before the line where `total` is declared and initialized.

To test that doubles works:

```csharp
roll1 = 6;
roll2 = 6;
roll3 = 5;
```

When you run the code, you should see:

```output
Dice roll: 6 + 6 + 5 = 17
You rolled doubles!  +2 bonus to total!
You win!
```
To test that triples work, modify the value of `roll3` like so:

```csharp
roll1 = 6;
roll2 = 6;
roll3 = 6;
```
When you run the code, you should see:

```output
Dice roll: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18
You rolled triples!  +6 bonus to total!
You win!
```

# Step 3 - Use the if-elseif-else statement to give a prize instead of a win-lose message.

To make the game more fun, let's change the game from win-or-lose to award fictitious prizes for each score.  We'll offer four prizes.  The player should only win one prize.

- If the player scores greater or equal to 16, they'll win a new car.
- If the player scores greater or equal to 10, they'll win a new laptop.
- If the player scores exactly 7, they'll win a trip.
- Otherwise, the player wins a kitten.

Modify the code from the previous steps to the following code listing:

```csharp-interactive
Random dice = new Random();

int roll1 = dice.Next(1, 7);
int roll2 = dice.Next(1, 7);
int roll3 = dice.Next(1, 7);

int total = roll1 + roll2 + roll3;

Console.WriteLine($"Dice roll: {roll1} + {roll2} + {roll3} = {total}");

if ((roll1 == roll2) || (roll2 == roll3) || (roll1 == roll3))
{
    if ((roll1 == roll2) && (roll2 == roll3))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You rolled triples!  +6 bonus to total!");
        total += 6;
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You rolled doubles!  +2 bonus to total!");
        total += 2;
    }
}

if (total >= 16)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You win a new car!");
}
else if (total >= 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You win a new laptop!");
}
else if (total == 7)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You win a trip for two!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You win a kitten!");
}
```

> [!Note]
> Use the technique of temporarily hard coding the roll variables to test each message.

The `if-elseif-else` statement allows you to create multiple exclusive conditions as boolean expressions.  In other words, when you only want one outcome to happen, but you have several possible conditions and results, then use as many `else if` statements as you want.  If none of the `if` and `else if` statements apply, then the final `else` code block will be executed.  The `else` is optional, but must come last. 

## Recap

- The `if-else` allows you to test for a condition and perform code when a boolean expression is true, and different code with the boolean expression is false.
- You can nest if statements to narrow down a possible condition.  However, you should consider using the `if-elseif-else` statement instead.
- Use `elseif` to create multiple exclusive conditions.
- An `else` is optional, but it must always come last.
