Defining your infrastructure as code provides you with the most benefit when you deploy all of your infrastructure from code, and use pipelines to run your deployments. In this module, you learned how to enforce the deployment of Azure infrastructure as code, and how to apply controls and governance to secure your environment in the process.

You learned how to plan your environments so that you can strategically target your controls where they’ll have the highest impact. Then, because deployment pipelines are so important, you learned how to apply controls to your pipelines and repositories. Finally, you learned how to restrict your Azure environment to ensure that all changes are deployed by using your approved process, with the exception of emergency situations.

Now, you’re able to increase your confidence in, and the security of, your Azure deployments by ensuring that changes follow a consistent process, are audited and logged, and can only be performed by authorized users.
