There may be many scenarios where content moderation is required. We present a few examples here that offer insight into some applications of Content Moderator. Using these scenarios, you may come up with other ideas on how you can integrate the Content Moderator API into your applications.

## Community support forums

Your company may sell products and/or services that require support options. Perhaps you host support forums online, you may want to ensure that the content, posted on these forums, is family-friendly and doesn't contain objectionable content. You could use Content Moderator to scan the text of posts before you publish them. If you allow uploading of images, Content Moderator can also scan the images to ensure they're appropriate.

You might even decide to create a custom list of terms that could help identify online bullying. Use of moderation here, can help you maintain a friendly and supportive forum for your products and services, and increase customer satisfaction with your company.

## Chat rooms

Perhaps you operate online chat rooms for your gaming platforms. You may want to moderate the content that is posted in these rooms to ensure it meets your acceptable use policies. These policies can dictate acceptable content that isn't rude, not racist, doesn't contain sexually explicit material, etc.

## Online company review sites

You may host an independent review site that permits posts that review companies, organizations, and products. Review sites that aren't moderated, could contain objectionable material that isn't appropriate for all audiences. Reviews that contain objectionable material could also result in your company being held liable for the material that is posted there.
