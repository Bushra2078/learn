Users need to authenticate whenever they're accessing protected resources. In our scenario, the bank requires the customer to sign in before they're able to access information. The bank uses Django as its web app development framework. In this unit, you'll learn how to sign in users to a Django web app registered in an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.

## OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow

When the application needs a user to sign in, or needs an access token to act on their behalf, it redirects the user over to Azure ADâ€™s authorization endpoint to authenticate. Azure AD redirects the user upon a successful sign-in back to a specific URL in the app and includes an authorization code that only Azure AD can read. The web app takes this authorization code, which is valid for a short time, and includes it in a request to the Azure AD token endpoint. This flow is the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow.

Azure AD issues your app with an ID token once the user is signed-in. The header and signature of the ID token are used to verify the authenticity of the token, while the payload contains the information about the user requested by your client.

## Sign-in process

The first step of the sign-in process is to send a request to the `/authorize` endpoint on Azure AD. The user is presented with a sign-in prompt by Azure AD. If the sign-in attempt is successful, the user's browser is redirected back to this app's `/redirect` endpoint. In our case, the redirect endpoint is `/auth/redirect`. A successful request to this endpoint will contain an authorization code. The web app uses this authorization code to acquire an ID token and an access token from Azure AD. It's the application's responsibility to store these tokens securely.

## Sign-in to a Django web app

When signing in users to a Django web app, we use the Microsoft identity web Python library. This library acts a wrapper of the MSAL for Python library and handles much of the required MSAL for Python configurations. In the *aad.config.json* file, we configure the following endpoints to be used during the auth flow.

```json
    "auth_endpoints": {
        "prefix": "auth",
        "sign_in": "sign_in",
        "edit_profile": "edit_profile",
        "redirect": "redirect",
        "sign_out": "sign_out",
        "post_sign_out": "post_sign_out"
    }
```

We register these urls as MSAL urls in the projects *urls.py* file.

```python
    from ms_identity_web.django.msal_views_and_urls import MsalViews
       
    msal_urls = MsalViews(settings.MS_IDENTITY_WEB).url_patterns()

    path(f'{settings.AAD_CONFIG.django.auth_endpoints.prefix}/', include(msal_urls)),
```

This code sets up middleware and hooks up all necessary endpoints for the authentication process into your Django app under a route prefix (*/auth* by default). For example, the redirect endpoint is found at */auth/redirect*.

When a user navigates to */auth/sign_in* and completes a sign-in attempt, the resulting identity data is put into the session. This data can be accessed through the request object at *request.identity_context_data*. When an endpoint is decorated with `@ms_identity_web.login_required`, the application only allows requests to the endpoint from authenticated (signed-in) users. If the user isn't signed-in, a `401: unauthorized` error is thrown, and the browser is redirected to the 401 handler.
