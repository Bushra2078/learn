The Microsoft identity platform helps you build applications that your users and customers can sign in to. Users can sign in by using accounts provisioned through Microsoft Entra ID.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a banking company as a developer. Your company wants to develop a web application to help customers access services and information. These services include checking their account balances, making transactions, and applying for loans.

To meet security requirements, users need to authenticate before they can access these resources. Your company uses Python Django as the web framework to build its web apps. You've been tasked with building a mechanism to authenticate users.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll create a Django web app that authenticates users by using Microsoft Entra ID:

- Register a Django web application in a Microsoft Entra tenant.
- Configure a Django web application to use its tenant registration details.
- Sign in users to a Django web app by using Microsoft Entra ID.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to register a Django web application in a Microsoft Entra tenant and sign in users to the Django web app by using Microsoft Entra ID.
