      isCorrect: false
    - content: Database files, log files, and backup files
      isCorrect: true

  - content: 'An Azure SQL database firewall rule can filter which IP addresses?'
    choices:
    - content: Azure-only IP addresses 
      isCorrect: false
    - content: IP addresses of other databases
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Networks created on an Azure virtual network
      isCorrect: false
    - content: Any IP address or IP address range
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Azure SQL database firewalls have no restrictions and can define filters for IP addresses and IP address ranges.

  - content: 'Is encrypted communication turned on automatically when connecting to an Azure SQL Server?'
    choices:
    - content: Yes
      isCorrect: false
    - content: No
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: The encryption options are defined in the connection string of the database. The connection string should be set to use encryption and to not trust the certificate. This can help reduce the likelihood of a man-in-the-middle attack.
