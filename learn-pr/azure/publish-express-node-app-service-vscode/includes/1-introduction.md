Express.js is a popular framework that you can use to create websites with server-side code in JavaScript. It's easy to host Express.js websites in Azure App Service.

Suppose you work as a web developer for a video game studio. Your organization is launching a brand new video game they have been developing in secret. This year's biggest video game expo is happening in just a few weeks. The studio wants a brand new website to be ready for the launch as soon as possible to maximize exposure. The site must have a live countdown to the date of the studio's on-stage announcement where they'll finally reveal their new video game. The studio isn't sure about the exact details they want to put up on the website, but they'll know closer to the day of their announcement. You must be able to easily and rapidly update the site with the details when the time comes.

In this module, you'll install the Express.js framework and use it to build a website with a countdown on it. Then, you'll use Visual Studio Code to publish it to Azure. You'll also examine how new versions of the website are managed.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to publish and update websites built in Express.js in Azure App Service.
