## Chunk your content into subtasks

| Subtask                                           | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet?  | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
