Imagine that you work as a SOC Analyst for an organization that is looking to advance their security management capabilities. The business has already started moving some workloads to the public cloud, and you've been asked to evaluate *security information and event management* (SIEM) solutions that can help in both an on-premises and multi-cloud environment. You've heard about Azure Sentinel and want to see whether this could potentially be the right SIEM for your business.

Ideally, you'd select a service that provides the features and functionality that you need, with minimal administration and a flexible pricing model.

This is exactly what we can do with Azure Sentinel.
