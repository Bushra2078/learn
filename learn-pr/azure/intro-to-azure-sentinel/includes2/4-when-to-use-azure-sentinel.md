Azure Sentinel provides you with a solution to perform security operations on our cloud and on-premises environments.

Azure Sentinel should be used if you are looking to collect event data from various sources and you wish to perform security operations on that data to identify suspicious activity. Security operations could include:

* Visualization of log data
* Anomaly detection
* Threat hunting
* Security incident investigation
* Automated response to alerts and/or incidents

Azure Sentinel offers some other capabilities that could help you make the decision as to whether it is the right fit for you:

* Cloud-native SIEM - No servers to provision, effortless scale.
* Integration with Azure Logic Apps and its hundreds of connectors for integration.
* Leverage Microsoft research and machine learning.
* Key log sources provided for free.
* Support for hybrid cloud and on-premises.
* SIEM and a data lake all in one.

Your organization had some clear requirements when you began investigating if Azure Sentinel would be the right fit for them:

* Support for data from multiple cloud environments
* Features and functionality required of a SOC, without too much administrative overhead

You have found that by leveraging data connectors for syslog, AWS and others as well as the  ability to achieve effortless scale without provisioning servers, that Azure Sentinel could be a good fit for them. During your analysis, you also realized that they should make automation a key part of their SOC strategy and will be looking to leverage playbooks too. This was something they had not considered before. 

If you are collecting infrastructure or application logs for performance monitoring purposes, then you should also consider using Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for that purpose.

If you are looking to understand the security posture of your environment, ensure you're compliant with policy and check for security misconfigurations, you should also leverage Azure Security Center. You can ingest Azure Security Center alerts as a data connector for Azure Sentinel.
