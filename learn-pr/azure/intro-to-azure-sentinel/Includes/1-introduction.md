# Introduction

Imagine that you work as a SOC Analyst for a national insurance provider, Contoso. The business has already started moving some workloads to the public cloud, and you've been tasked with evaluating Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions that can help in both an on premises and multi-cloud environment. You've heard about Azure Sentinel and want to see whether this could potentially be the right SIEM for your business.

Ideally, you'd leverage a service that provides the features and functionality that you need, without too much administration &mdash; as well as a flexible pricing model too.

This is exactly what we can do with Azure Sentinel.

In this module, you'll explore Azure Sentinel and discover why and when you should use it. You'll investigate the key features and capabilities of Azure Sentinel, how and when to deploy it.
