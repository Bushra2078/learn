Translator is a cognitive service that converts text from one language to another. Using Artificial Intelligence, Translator can automatically detect the source language of documents and translate the text into the languages of your choice while maintaining the text’s layout and formatting - in near real time.

The service can also create more inclusive and accessible learning environments for new language learners by presenting content in their first language, which they can then use to learn the new language without falling behind in school. Translator can also help parents who have a different first language be more involved in their child’s education. What's more, multiple documents can be translated into 90 different languages with Translator, including functionality to help with the translation of content with industry-specific words and pronouns.
