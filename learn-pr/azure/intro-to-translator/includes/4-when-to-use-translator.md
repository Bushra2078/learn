The need for translation to facilitate our social and work is growing every day. While translation is already accessible in products people use daily, such as web browsers, Office365, and search engines, users of many other applications can benefit from more inclusive, accessible technologies.

## Web localization

Localizing websites to the target audience and language is often too expensive for all but those in the top markets, which has resulted in localized content rarely being translated a few clicks beyond the homepage. Translator can help anyone who can't undertake manual localization of their websites reach their target audiences in their language, while increasing overall accessibility to customers and partners.

## Public service announcements

Messages to the general public must be easily understood and trusted. With translation services in collaboration with Azure speech services, organizations can quickly translate announcements into multiple languages and dialects. Recent improvements with Translator mean that you can also translate from a language without gender agreement to a language with gender agreement, such as English to Arabic, providing further clarity and intelligibility.

## Business Intelligence

Translator can help BI applications where data is in various languages, as most analytical tools are only able to process one language. As Translator is available via REST, you can integrate functionality with other services and applications—such as Form Recognizer and Cognitive search—to improve analysis of documents and other data sources.

## Online learning

The global reach of online courses' means that educational material needs to serve a broader audience. With Translator, course materials can be translated into multiple languages while maintaining the existing layout. Overall creating wider accessibility to help students fully grasp the course material, no matter their language background.

Audio instructions can also be translated and captioned in real-time with **Speech translation services**, allowing students to follow conversations in the language they’re most comfortable with. The service will also filter out unnecessary filler words, such as "um’s,” stutters, and repetitions- making the conversation clearer.

## Assistive technology

For people with learning differences, translation services can make information more accessible. To exemplify, the translation of traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese, results in the numbers of characters and their structure to become easier to understand. This service can make text easier to read and remember, creating inclusive environments for students who struggle with text comprehension due to learning differences or language learners who may not fully understand the language.

## Modern work environments

People need to be able to communicate across the world, no matter what languages they speak. Being able to automatically translate all documentation—from internal training manuals to simple email conversations—is essential to accessible, effective work environments. Custom translator can also ensure that industry-specific terminology is not lost in translation.
