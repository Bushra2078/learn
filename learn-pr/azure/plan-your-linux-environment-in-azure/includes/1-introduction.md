Azure offers several options for deploying Linux-based Azure VMs. However, to optimize their usage from the performance, functionality, and pricing standpoint, you must properly plan for their deployment and configuration.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work as an information technology (IT) system engineer for a financial services company. The company intends to transition its existing on-premises Linux-based workloads to Azure VMs, which will require consolidating and upgrading some of these systems. You have been asked to design a set of guidelines that will help the company achieve this transition in an optimal manner. The guidelines should ensure that the target environment is properly sized and secure. At the same time, the guidelines should facilitate the same support, performance, and functionality as the on-premises environment.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll review the process for planning a deployment of Azure VMs running Linux. This process involves choosing the VM sizes most suitable for their intended workloads and identifying corresponding networking dependencies. Youâ€™ll also review the storage options and optimization techniques that will help you maximize the benefits of the planned deployment. 

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to plan for and recommend the compute, networking, and storage options for deploying Azure VMs running Linux. You'll also have a better understanding of the overall platform capabilities, which will help you optimize Linux environments on Azure VMs.
