Your website's development team wanted to be able to deploy their changes within a Test environment, while keeping your production environment available for end users. 

In this module you learned how to add multiple environments to a YAML pipeline. You did this in such a way to allow for reuse. You were able to generalize the similar steps in a pipeline template and to vary on differences across environments by using parameters. 

Now you can easily make additional environments available if needed.
