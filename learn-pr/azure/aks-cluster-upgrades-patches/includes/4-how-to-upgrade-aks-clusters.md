Suppose the Nod Publishers deployment team has already deployed their containerized applications onto an AKS cluster version that will go out of support within the next 30 days. They must upgrade to the latest Kubernetes version supported by Azure Kubernetes Service while ensuring the applications do not suffer from any downtime during the upgrade. 

There are several methods of upgrading their AKS clusters in a safely. We will discuss one of these methods which is the Blue/Green deployment method.

### The Blue/Green deployment method

The Blue/Green deployment method requires two production environments, a blue environment and a green environment that are almost identical. The router responsible for directing traffic will route all traffic to one environment. This will be the live environment. The other environment is kept offline where new features and patches could be tested. When testing is complete, the router switches and routes traffic to the other environment. This brings the offline environment online and takes the online environment offline.

For example, the Nod Publishers deployment team following a Blue/Green deployment methodology will need to create two identical AKS cluster environments, a blue environment that is currently live and a green environment that is currently offline.

When they upgrade their AKS clusters to the latest supported version, they make the upgrade to the AKS cluster in the green environment and test the green environment to ensure no issues arise from the upgrade.

Once the green environment is ready to go, they can switch the router to direct all user traffic to the green environment and take the blue environment offline.

One of the benefits of Blue/Green deployment is that if Nod Publishers detected an issue with the upgraded ASK cluster versions in the green environment, they can roll back to the blue environment by switching the router and thereby minimizing application downtime.
