Our goal was to help you evaluate if Azure Purview was the right choice to help you manage your enterprise data environment and get a handle on your various data sources. We presented content on the following features:
* Registering data sources
* Mapping data sources
* Scanning data in your sources
* Exploring metadata and classification of the data

We covered how the Azure Purview Studio is used to register data sources and create a data map. Setting up scanning caused Azure Purview to scan through the selected data types in the sources, and list metadata associated with those sources.  This metadata helps data consumers discover what is contained in the data sources, documenting the expected usage. We also showed how the metadata includes classification information to help identify sensitive data.

The criteria help you evaluate how Azure Purview can help your business catalog data for users and data producers. It also showed how Azure Purview can help your company meet its data governance needs through the use of the metadata and classification features.
