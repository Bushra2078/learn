Tracking the data that your organization uses can be challenging. The data is constantly growing, stored in different locations, and shared among users. How do users know what data is available? How do administrators manage data when they may not know what type of data exists and where it is stored? Does the data contain sensitive or personal information?

All these questions are typically not easy to answer without insights into the data and the source of storage. Before you can develop solid security plans for storage and usage, it's important to have a good idea of the data your organization uses.

## Example scenario
Suppose you are a data consumer or producer of data. You may be a business or technical data analyst, data scientist, or data engineer. You likely spend much time on manual processes to annotate, catalog, and find trusted data sources.

Because there's no central location to register data sources, users might be unaware of a data source unless they come into contact with it as part of another process.

Annotating data sources with descriptive metadata is often a lost effort. Client applications typically ignore descriptions that are stored in the data source. Creating documentation for data sources can be difficult and it's an ongoing responsibility to keep documentation in sync with data sources. Users might not trust documentation that's perceived as being out of date.

Azure Purview is designed to address these issues and to help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets. The catalog makes data sources easily discoverable and understandable by the users who manage the data.
