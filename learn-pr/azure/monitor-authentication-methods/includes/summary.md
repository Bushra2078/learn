You were recently hired by a multinational insurance company. In your first project, you need to create new security policies. Implementing these policies requires you to create a Microsoft Entra workbook that generates a report about the authentication methods used in your companies environment.

You have learned that the activity logs in Microsoft Entra ID have the data you need to solve your business problem. To create the required report, you need to integrate the sign-in logs with Log Analytics. The integration into Log Analytics enables you to extract the data you need for your project using KQL. The integration is also a requirement to build Microsoft Entra workbooks.
