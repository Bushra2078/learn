  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'You need to connect Azure resources like Azure virtual machines across geographical regions. Which Azure networking option should you use?'
    choices:
    - content: "Subnet"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Subnets allow you to segment the virtual network into one or more sub-networks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. "
    - content: "Azure Virtual Network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure Virtual Network allows you to connect resources within the same subscription and region. You can connect virtual networks from different regions by using virtual network peering."
    - content: "Virtual network peering"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use virtual network peering to connect virtual networks to each other so resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other. The virtual networks you connect can be in different Azure regions."
  - content: 'What are the key parameters that you must specify when you create an Azure VPN gateway with Azure PowerShell?'
    choices:
    - content: "-GatewayType Vpn and -VpnType RouteBased"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Those are key parameters but you also need to specify a -GatewaySku. The default is VpnGw1. If that SKU does not meet your organization's needs, you'd have to recreate the VPN gateway with the SKU that meets your organization's network requirements."
    - content: "-GatewayType Vpn, -VpnType RouteBased, and a -GatewaySku"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use the PowerShell cmdlet New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway where you use parameters -GatewayType Vpn and -VpnType RouteBased. Also set the -GatewaySku to the SKU that meets your organization's network requirements."
    - content: "-Subnet GatewaySubnet and -GatewayType Vpn"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You must create a gateway subnet with the name GatewaySubnet in order for the VPN gateway to function properly. But when you create the VPN gateway with the cmdlet New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway, you specify the -IpConfigurations for that subnet."
  - content: 'Which peering configuration would you use for your Express route circuit where you need to allow private connections to an Azure SQL database on a public IP address?'
    choices:
    - content: "Azure public peering"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure public peering enables private connections to services that are available on public IP addresses. Some examples of services that support this are: Azure Storage, and Azure SQL databases."
    - content: "Azure private peering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure private peering lets you directly connect to virtual machines and cloud services on their private IP addresses."
    - content: "Microsoft peering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft peering supports connections to cloud-based SaaS offerings, such as Office 365 and Dynamics 365."
  - content: 'Which protocol provides dynamic routing for Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: "IPVPN"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Any-to-any (IPVPN) network is a connectivity model that ExpressRoute supports."
    - content: "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Border Gateway Protocol is an industry-standard dynamic routing protocol that can exchange routes between your on-premises network, your instances in Azure, and Microsoft public addresses."
    - content: "S-key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An s-key is a GUID that defines an ExpressRoute circuit and provides the connectivity link between Microsoft, your connectivity provider, and your organization."
