With three viable bot building options, it can be difficult to know which is the best one for the scenario. In this unit, we'll analyze criteria based on our business requirements. Understanding the criteria can also help you better understand the nuanced differences between the products.

## Do you prefer a low-code design interface?

Power Virtual Agents has a low-code, visual designer hosted in a web app that you can use to design your bot. You can use the designer to create your bot, create and edit topics to govern conversation flow, and extend the bot with built-in AI capabilities, entities, variables and Bot Framework skills.

With QnA Maker, you create a bot from the QnA Maker portal interface, after you've created and designed your QnA Maker knowledgebase. The QnA Maker portal doesn't offer bot modification possibilities, so if you needed to modify your bot to meet test requirements, you would have to edit the bot source code.

Bot Framework Composer has a low-code, visual designer that you can download for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can also host Composer as a shared, hosted web service.Composer offers extensive bot building capabilities, including controlling conversation flow, defining intents and entities, and adding authentication. Composer also offers built-in low-code integration with LUIS and QnA Maker.

## Do you require low-code integration with other components?

Power Virtual Agents offers integration with Bot Framework skills and Power Automate connectors in a low-code environment. You can also modify Power Virtual Agents bots with the Bot Framework Composer, further extending your integration capabilities.

QnA Maker does not offer significant integration capabilities in a low-code design environment.

## Do you need a bot building tool that supports code-based development with the bot source?
