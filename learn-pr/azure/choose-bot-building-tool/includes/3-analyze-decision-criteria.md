You must analyze your company's criteria. This will help you choose the bot-building option with the best fit for your company.

## Compare bot-building options based on your requirements

You have three bot-building options (Power Virtual Agents, QnA Maker, and Bot Framework Composer) to compare so you can decide which is best for your company. Start by analyzing how each tool fulfills the criteria based on your company's requirements. Also examine the nuanced differences between the products. Consider the answers to the following questions as you compare the three bot-building options.

### Do you prefer a low-code design interface?

If you prefer a low-code design interface, compare the three options:

- Power Virtual Agents has a low-code, visual designer. The designer is hosted in a web app that you can use to design your bot. You can use the designer to create your bot and create and edit topics to govern conversation flow. You can also extend the bot with built-in AI capabilities, entities, variables, and Bot Framework skills.

- QnA Maker has a portal interface you use to create a bot. You do this after you've created and designed your QnA Maker knowledge base.

     > [!NOTE]
     > The QnA Maker portal doesn't offer bot-modification options. If you must modify your bot to meet test requirements, you'd have to edit the bot's source code.

- Bot Framework Composer has a low-code, visual designer that you can download for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can also host Bot Framework Composer as a shared, hosted web service. Bot Framework Composer offers extensive bot building capabilities, including controlling conversation flow, defining intents and entities, and adding authentication. Bot Framework Composer also offers built-in low-code integration with LUIS and QnA Maker.

### Do you require low-code integration with other components?

If you require low-code integration with other components, compare the three options:

- Power Virtual Agents offers integration with Bot Framework skills and Power Automate connectors in a low-code environment. You can also modify Power Virtual Agents bots with Bot Framework Composer, further extending your integration capabilities.

- QnA Maker doesn't offer significant integration capabilities in a low-code design environment.

- Bot Framework Composer offers comprehensive integration possibilities. You can use Bot Framework Composer to extend the functionality of your bot with numerous AI, logic, and task-based features. Bot Framework Composer also offers built-in integration with LUIS and QnA Maker.

### Do you need a bot-building tool that supports code-based development with the bot source?

If you need a bot-building tool that supports code-based development with the bot source, consider the three options:

- Power Virtual Agents bots can't be modified directly using a code-based IDE.

- QnA Maker bots can be modified by working in the bot source code to add or enhance bot functionality. You can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other code-based IDE that supports the language and libraries you require.

- Bot Framework Composer bots are fully extensible using the Bot Framework SDK. You can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other code-based IDE that supports the language and libraries you require.

### Do you need specific publishing options?

If you have specific publishing option requirements, compare the three options:

- Power Virtual Agents bots can be published to a website or the Power Apps portal. You can add Power Virtual Agents bots to Azure Bot Service channels, Microsoft Teams, Facebook, or to mobile or custom apps.

- QnA Maker bots and Bot Framework Composer bots are created as Azure Bot Service bots. You can host them in Azure Web App or connect them to many channels, including web chat, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Outlook, and Slack.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Bot Framework Composer bots can be hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS) or other web hosting services. This requires an internet-accessible endpoint and a valid HTTPS certificate.
