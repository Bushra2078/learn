You can create bots in Azure using various methods. To determine which method to use in specific scenarios, examine the fundamental differences between the different bot-building tools that Azure provides.

Imagine you work for a financial services company. Your company is considering using a bot to help with customer support inquiries and advise customers about new services. The bot would be hosted on your company website. Your customer support team wants to be involved in building a test bot. However, they don't have significant experience developing bots from scratch using software development kits (SDKs) and code-based development tools. You must determine which tool you should use to build the test bot.

If the test bot is successful, your company would like to extend functionality based on pre-existing C# libraries. Your company also wants to integrate your company's RESTful FAQ database application so the bot can answer common questions without human interaction. You'd also like to integrate an existing LUIS app for language understanding that is trained to recognize financial industry terms and phrases.

Microsoft Azure allows you to create bots by using different tools. In this module, you’ll learn about the fundamental differences between the bot-building tools that Azure provides. You’ll compare creating bots by using Power Virtual Agents, QnA Maker, and Bot Framework Composer and  Bot Service. You’ll then determine which tool you would use in specific scenarios. You'll also examine when you should choose one tool over another.
