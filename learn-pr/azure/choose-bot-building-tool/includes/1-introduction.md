A bot provides a conversational interface in websites and applications. Different bot-creation methods work better in specific scenarios. You must examine the differences between the various bot-building tools that Microsoft provides.

Imagine you work for a financial services company. They're considering using a bot to help with customer-support inquiries and advising customers about new services. You'll host the bot on your company website. The company's customer-support team wants to help build a test bot. However, they don't have experience developing bots from scratch using software development kits (SDKs) and code-based development tools. That's why you're researching the best tool to use to build the test bot.

If the test bot is successful, you'll extend functionality based on preexisting C# libraries. The plan also includes integrating your company's RESTful FAQ database application. This will enable the bot to answer common questions without human interaction. You'd also like to integrate an existing LUIS app for language understanding that is trained to recognize financial industry terms and phrases.

There are many bot-creation tools available. In this module, you’ll learn about the fundamental differences between the bot-building tools available from Microsoft. You’ll compare creating bots by using Power Virtual Agents, QnA Maker, and Bot Framework Composer and Bot Service. Then you'll decide which tool to use in specific scenarios and when to choose one versus another.
