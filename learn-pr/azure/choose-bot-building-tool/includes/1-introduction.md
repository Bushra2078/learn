Bots provide a conversational experience and can be used to shift simple, repetitive tasks, such as making travel arrangements or gathering user information, on to automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. You can converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. Bot interactions can be quick questions and answers, guided conversation flows, or a sophisticated conversation that integrates with external capabilities and AI systems.

Imagine you work for a financial services company. Your company is considering using a bot to help with customer support inquiries and advise customers about new services. The bot would be hosted on your company website. Your customer support team would like to be involved in building a test bot, but they don't have significant experience developing bots from scratch using software development kits (SDKs) and code-based development tools. If the test bot is successful, your company would like to extend functionality based on pre-existing C# libraries and integrate your company's RESTful FAQ database application so the bot can answer common questions without human interaction. You would also like to integrate an existing LUIS app for language understanding that is trained to recognize financial industry terms and phrases. You must determine which tool you should use to build the test bot.
