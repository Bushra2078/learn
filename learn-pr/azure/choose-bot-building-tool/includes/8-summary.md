The financial services company you work for wants to create and test a bot's functionality for fielding customer-support requests and advising customers about new services. You discovered fundamental differences between the available tools you can use to build and publish bots in Azure. You also examined why you'd choose one tool versus another. You explored key requirements, including conversational flow, development particulars, and where bots could be published. You evaluated Power Virtual Agents, QnA Maker, and Bot Framework Composer against these requirements. Ultimately, you decided that Bot Framework Composer is the best solution for your company.

Your evaluation helped your company choose the most appropriate bot-building tool for its needs. If you hadn't conducted your evaluation, your company might have used a tool that didn't support their needs. This lack of knowledge might have meant that your company had to start the bot-development process again with a different tool. Now your customer-support and development teams can begin bot building secure in the knowledge that they're using a tool that will meet their requirements throughout the entire project.
