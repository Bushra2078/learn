In this module, you've learned about the fundamental differences between the bot-building tools that Azure provides and when you should choose one over the other.

In your scenario, the financial services company you work for wanted to create a bot to test core functionality for fielding customer support requests and advising customers about new services. You examined the key requirements:

- The initial development of the bot should be in a low-code designer.
- The test bot should include an existing LUIS app for language understanding that is trained to recognize financial industry terms and phrases.
- The bot will be hosted on the company website.
- After testing, your team will integrate several C# libraries to extend functionality.
- You need to integrate your bot with a pre-existing REST-enabled FAQ application.

You evaluated Power Virtual Agents, QnA Maker, and Bot Framework Composer against these requirements, determining that Composer was the best solution.

Without your evaluation, your company might have used a tool that didn't support their needs and been forced to start the development process over using a different bot building tool.

Be performing this evaluation, you were able to help your company choose the most appropriate bot building tool and get your customer support and development teams started in bot building using a tool that will meet their requirements throughout the entire project.
