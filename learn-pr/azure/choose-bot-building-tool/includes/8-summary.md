In this module, you learned about the fundamental differences between the bot-building tools that you can use to publish bots in Azure. You also examined when and why you should choose one over the others.

In your scenario, the financial services company you work for wanted to create a bot to test core functionality for fielding customer support requests and advising customers about new services. You examined the key requirements, including examining conversational flow, development particulars, and where the bot could be published. You evaluated Power Virtual Agents, QnA Maker, and Bot Framework Composer against these requirements. You determined that Bot Framework Composer was the best solution for your company.

By performing this evaluation, you helped your company choose the most appropriate bot-building tool. Without your evaluation, your company might have used a tool that didn't support their needs and been forced to start the development process over using a different bot-building tool. Your company's customer support and development teams can get started in bot building using a tool that will meet their requirements throughout the entire project.
