## Review your company's criteria

Recall the criteria for creating the bot that should inform your decision-making process:

- The initial development of a test bot should be in a low-code designer.
- The test bot should include an existing LUIS app for language understanding. It should be trained to recognize financial industry terms and phrases.
- The bot will be hosted on the company website.
- After testing the bot, your team needs to integrate into it several C# libraries to extend its functionality.
- After testing, you need to integrate the bot with a pre-existing REST-enabled FAQ application.

## Consider the Bot Framework Composer service

One of the options you are considering to build the bot is the Bot Framework Composer service. Use the previous list of criteria to examine the process of building a bot using Bot Framework Composer.

### Where do you publish the bot?

You can publish your bot to a wide variety of channels and endpoints, including a website. This fulfills one of your company's criteria.

### Where do you perform development?

Bot Framework Composer offers low-code design (which is one of your company's requirements) with a cross-platform visual design interface. Bot Framework Composer supports native integration capabilities for LUIS via a guided interface in the visual designer. You can natively integrate with both LUIS apps and QnA Maker knowledge bases. This integration extends language understanding and bot awareness. In addition, Bot Framework Composer offers full testing capabilities within the IDE.

All bots created with Bot Framework Composer can be extended with the Bot Framework SDK in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or your IDE of choice, so your development team can include their C# libraries and build integration for the REST-enabled FAQ application.
