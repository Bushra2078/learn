Continue comparing bot-creation service options by examining Bot Framework Composer functionality.

## Review your company's criteria

Recall the criteria for creating the bot that should inform your decision-making process:

- The initial development of a test bot should be in a low-code designer.
- The test bot should include an existing LUIS app for language understanding. You should train the bot to recognize financial industry terms and phrases.
- You should host the bot on your company website.
- After your team tests the bot, they need to integrate several C# libraries into it, to extend its functionality.
- After your testing is complete, you need to integrate the bot with a pre-existing REST-enabled FAQ application.

## Consider the Bot Framework Composer service

One tool you're considering using to build your bot is the Bot Framework Composer service. Use the previous list of criteria to examine the process of building a bot using Bot Framework Composer.

### What informs conversational flow?

Using Bot Framework Composer, you can create and edit complex conversation flows to ensure appropriate responses to your customer service requests. Conversational flow can include:

- Conditional branching
- Loops
- Multiple dialogs

> [!TIP]
> You can use multiple dialogs for more complex interactions needed in specific customer support scenarios.

### Where do you publish the bot?

You can publish your bot to a wide variety of channels and endpoints, including a website. This ability fulfills one of your company's criteria.

### Where do you perform development?

Bot Framework Composer offers low-code design (which is one of your company's requirements) with a cross-platform visual design interface. Composer supports native integration capabilities for LUIS via a guided interface in the visual designer. You can natively integrate with both LUIS apps and QnA Maker knowledge bases. This integration extends language understanding and bot awareness. Composer also offers full testing capabilities within an IDE.

You can extend all bots that you create with Composer by using the Bot Framework SDK in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or another IDE. Your development team can include their C# libraries and build integration for the REST-enabled FAQ application.
