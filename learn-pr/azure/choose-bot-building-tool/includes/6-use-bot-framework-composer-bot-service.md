In your scenario, the financial services company you work for wants to create a bot to test core functionality for fielding customer support requests and advising customers about new services. If the test is successful, your team will pursue further development to implement more sophisticated features. You have several important factors that will inform your decision-making process:

- The initial development of the bot should be in a low-code designer.
- The test bot should include an existing LUIS app for language understanding that is trained to recognize financial industry terms and phrases.
- The bot will be hosted on the company website.
- After testing, your team will integrate several C# libraries to extend functionality.
- You need to integrate your bot with a pre-existing REST-enabled FAQ application.

## Which service should you choose?

Bot Framework Composer offers low-code design a cross-platform visual design interface. Using Composer, you can create and edit complex conversation flows to ensure appropriate responses to your customer service requests. Conversational flow can include conditional branching, loops, multiple dialogs for more complex interactions that you could use in specific customer support scenarios. You can natively integrate with both LUIS apps and QnA Maker knowledge bases to extend language understanding and bot awareness. COmposer offers full testing capabilities within the IDE, and you can publish your bot to a wide variety of channels and endpoints, including a website.

Relevant to our scenario, Composer offers a full-featured low-code visual designer that offers complete control over the bot authoring experience. Composer supports native integration capabilities for LUIS via a guided interface in the visual designer. Publishing options for a Composer-authored bot include publishing to a web page. All bots created with Composer can be extended with the Bot Framework SDK in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or your IDE of choice, so your development team can include their C# libraries and build integration for the REST-enabled FAQ application.
