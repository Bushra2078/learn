## Role(s)

- Solution Architect

## Level

- Intermediate

## Product(s)

- Azure Site Recovery

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure virtual machines
- Basic knowledge of Azure virtual networks

## Summary

Provide disaster recovery for your Azure infrastructure by managing and orchestrating replication, failover, and failback of Azure virtual machines with Azure Site Recovery.

## Learning objectives

1. Protect Azure virtual machines with Azure Site Recovery
2. Run a disaster recovery drill to validate protection
3. Failover and failback your virtual machines

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Protect your Azure infrastructure with Azure Site Recovery*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    An organization based in the tropics recently suffered an large outage due to building damage from a hurricane. They are now moving their infrastructure to Azure, and have learned their lesson from not having a proper plan for disaster recovery. Even though they are moving to the cloud, they know that disasters can happen anywhere, and want to make sure they have protection should something occur in their cloud environment. They have a number of virtual machines running in Azure, and need to provide recovery capabilities for these VMs in the event of a disaster in an Azure region.

2. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

3. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

4. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    2. Step
    3. Step

5. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

## Notes

Detail the features of ASR for protecting resources (primarily VM-based) in Azure. Go through a basic activity of setting up ASR, failing over, and failing back.
