  questions:

  - content: "Which four ways does Site Recovery protect virtual machine infrastructure?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Implements an organizations BCDR, enables automatic failover and recovery, failed over machines are automatically protected, automatically manages backup storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Failover and failback are manual, not automatic. Using Site Recovery can help meet an organizations BCDR, but can't implement it as a whole. The backup and syncing are automatic."
    - content: "Creates snapshots and recovery points, replicates VMs to a secondary region, supports DR drills, and enables flexible failover / failback"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "These are the four main features of Site Recovery that will protect your virtual machines."
    - content: "Backs up VM disks locally and to a different region, automatically manages backup storage, creates a Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS), mirrors workloads between primary and secondary regions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These are features provided by Azure Backup, not Site Recovery."

  - content: "How are storage accounts used by Site Recovery to store data backups?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Site Recovery creates recovery services vaults."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Recovery services vaults are used to store backup data, VM configuration settings, and workloads."
    - content: "Site Recovery creates docker containers using storage accounts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Docker containers aren't used, Site Recovery uses recovery services vaults to store backup data, VM configuration settings, and workloads."
    - content: "Site Recovery creates and stores managed disks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Managed disks aren't used, Site Recovery uses recovery services vaults to store backup data, VM configuration settings, and workloads."

  - content: "Site Recovery is being used to reprotect a failed over VM, which PowerShell command allows you to monitor the progress? "
    choices:
    - content: "Get-AzRecoveryServicesAsrFabric"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This command gets the details of an Azure Site Recovery Fabric."
    - content: "Get-AzRecoveryServicesAsrRecoveryPlan"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This command gets a recovery plan or all the recovery plans in the Recovery Services vault"
    - content: "Get-AzRecoveryServicesAsrJob"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Gets the details of the specified Site Recovery job or the list of recent Site Recovery jobs in the Recovery Services vault. Specifying the job that started the reprotection will show its status."

  - content: "How does Site Recovery support grouping of machines and workloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "Site Recovery Mobility service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The mobility service is installed on VMS automatically by Site Recovery, it doesn't group machines together."
    - content: "Recovery plans."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Recovery plans allow you to group VMs around workloads. For example, a recovery plan protecting a company's e-commerce website would include the web server, database server, and API server."
    - content: "Azure Automation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Provides production-ready, application-specific scripts that can be downloaded and integrated with Site Recovery. It doesn't group machines together."
