Azure Site Recovery automates the setup of recovery from one region to another. The setup process will install the Mobility Service onto the VMs, create the required infrastructure in the recovery region, and give you a way to monitor the progress.

Currently, two VMs are running the company's patient and employee systems. These systems are running in the West US region. You've been asked to protect the infrastructure by enabling it to be recovered to the East US region. Using Azure Site Recovery, you'll enable a Recovery Services vault to replicate the current workloads.

In this exercise, you'll complete the setup of Azure Site Recovery using the Azure portal.
