You've learned about the benefits of Azure Site Recovery and how it fits into your company's BCDR policy. You've protected your company's infrastructure against disaster and tested its integrity with a disaster recovery drill. You then failed over a virtual machine, reprotected it, and then failed it back to its original region.

## Clean up

As you've used your Azure subscription or a free account, you'll need to delete all the created Site Recovery resources manually.

As part of the exercise steps, you created two regions and you'll need to delete both:

1. Delete the **east-coast-rg**, and **west-coast-rg** resource groups.
1. Another resource group was created automatically by Site Recovery, so you'll also need to delete the **west-coast-rg-asr** resource group.
