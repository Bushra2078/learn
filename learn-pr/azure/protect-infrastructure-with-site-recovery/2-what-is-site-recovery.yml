  questions:

  - content: "Which four ways does Site Recovery protect virtual machine infrastructure?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Implements an organizations BCDR, enables automatic failover and recovery, failed over machines are automatically protected, automatically manages backup storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Failover and failback are manual, not automatic. Using Site Recovery can help meet an organizations BCDR, but can't implement it as a whole. The backup and syncing are automatic."
    - content: "Creates snapshots and recovery points, replicates VMs to a secondary region, supports DR drills, and enables flexible failover / failback"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "These are the four main features of Site Recovery that will protect your virtual machines."
    - content: "Backs up VM disks locally and to a different region, automatically manages backup storage, creates a Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS), mirrors workloads between primary and secondary regions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These are features provided by Azure Backup, not Site Recovery."
