1. **What occurs when a node fails node health checks in an Azure CycleCloud cluster?**
1. The user must resubmit the job.
1. The user must terminate the cluster and recreate it.
1. Overprovisioning will allocate a healthy node to the cluster in place.
1. **When can a user run a Node Health Check in an Azure CycleCloud cluster?**
1. During cluster creation via the CycleCloud Web Portal.
1. After submitting a job to the cluster.
1. Whenever a node experiences downtime.
1. Node health checks will run automatically when new nodes are added to the cluster.

a. **Azure NetApp Files (ANF)**
a. **Azure Managed** **Lustre File System (AMLFS)**
a. **Azure Blob Storage**
a. **B & C**

   

4. **What are the essential compute requirements for running AI training workloads in an Azure CycleCloud and Slurm environment?**

Distributed training requires a multi-node environment with a minimum of 4 GPUs.

Single-node environments are sufficient for AI training workloads.

Premium SSDs are not necessary for OS disks.

InfiniBand connectivity is optional for AI training clusters.

**What are the benefits of choosing a Premium SSD option for your AI training workload?**

Faster data access and reduced latency. 

Shorter training times and faster model convergence. 

Improved scalability and parallelism. 

Enhanced support for generative AI and large language models. 

All of the above.
