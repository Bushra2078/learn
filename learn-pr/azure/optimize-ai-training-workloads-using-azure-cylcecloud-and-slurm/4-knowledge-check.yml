  questions:
  - content: "What occurs when a node fails node health checks in an Azure CycleCloud cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "The user must resubmit the job."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Resubmitting the job won't fix the unhealthy nodes."
    - content: "The user must terminate the cluster and recreate it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Terminating and recreating the cluster isn't necessary as overprovisioning will allocate a healthy node to the cluster."
    - content: "Overprovisioning allocates a healthy node to the cluster in place."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: "When can a user run the Node Health Check in an Azure CycleCloud cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "During Slurm cluster creation via the CycleCloud web portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Users can't manually run the NHC during cluster creation as NHC automatically run when new nodes are added to the cluster."
    - content: "After submitting a job to the cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Users can't manually run the NHC after submitting a job to the cluster as NHC  automatically run when new nodes are added to the cluster."  
    - content: "Whenever a node experiences downtime."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Users can't manually run the NHC when nodes are down as NHC automatically run when new nodes are added to the cluster."
    - content: "Node health checks run automatically when new nodes are added to the cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: "Which Azure service is designed for handling the most demanding, high-performance, low-latency workloads requiring advanced data management capabilities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: " "
    - content: "Azure NetApp Files (ANF)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: " "  
    - content: "Azure Managed Lustre File System (AMLFS)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wrong"
    - content: "Azure Blob Storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Blob Storage primarily serves as an object storage solution for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and backups."
    - content: "B & C"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."      
  - content: "What are the essential compute requirements for running AI training workloads in an Azure CycleCloud and Slurm environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Distributed training requires a multi-node environment with a minimum of 4 GPUs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Single-node environments are sufficient for AI training workloads."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "AI Training workloads require multi node environments due to the compute requirements of these workloads."  
    - content: "Premium SSDs aren'tt necessary for OS disks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Premium SSDs are required for OS disks as they provide low latency solutions for your high performance workloads."
    - content: "InfiniBand connectivity is optional for AI training clusters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "InfiniBand is essential for HPC and AI workloads due to its low latency, high bandwidth, and RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) capability."
  - content: "What are the benefits of choosing a Premium SSD option for your AI training workload?"
    choices:
    - content: "Faster data access and reduced latency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wrong"
    - content: "Shorter training times and faster model convergence."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wrong"  
    - content: "Improved scalability and parallelism."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wrong"
    - content: "Enhanced support for generative AI and large language models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wrong"
    - content: "All of the Above."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
