Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance offers a managed, scalable, and resilient deployment of the Microsoft SQL Server database engine in a wide range of hybrid scenarios.

### Example scenario

Suppose you work for a New York-based financial services company with a global customer base and several US government contracts. Your on-premises environment contains several SQL Server databases hosted in overseas datacenters that are subject to data residency requirements. It also includes the US government contract-related data that need to be fully isolated from the internet. For cloud-based data services, you rely on Azure SQL. These services include several deployments of SQL Server Managed Instance.

As the lead of the IT infrastructure engineering team, you assist solution architects, data engineers, and software developers with modernizing internal and public-facing services and applications. Your recent efforts led to your company adopting Kubernetes as the internal standard for container orchestration. Following the directives from the company’s technology leadership, you’re also exploring the opportunities to reduce administrative overhead, streamline the operational model, and increase the resiliency of business-critical workloads.

To find a solution that would help you reach all of these objectives and leverage the existing investment into Kubernetes, you decide to explore using Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance for hosting the remaining on-premises SQL Server databases.
