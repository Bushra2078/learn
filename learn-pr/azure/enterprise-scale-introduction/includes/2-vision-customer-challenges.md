Enterprise-scale architecture helps organizations get ready to take the first step in migration or to innovate on a new workloads in Azure. There are three customer challenges that enterprise-scale landing zones address:

- **Architecture complexity**: When an organization lacks the required level of understanding and experience on Azure, adoption can be challenging. The mismatch between on-premises infrastructure and cloud-design considerations creates dissonance and friction with adoption planning. Organizations struggle with the translation of on-premises requirements to Azure concepts, capabilities, and security models. Enterprise-scale architecture aligns technical architecture conversations into eight critical design areas to quickly organize teams and provide architectural recommendations.

- **Operating compatibility**: Existing approaches and functions for the traditional delivery and management of IT services are not compatible with the Azure platform and cloud operating models. An organization can face combined constraints where the lack of skills or experience creates a struggle to define the transformation of on-premises operating models to large-scale cloud infrastructure. Traditional IT management models can get lost in translation between cloud concepts, security models, and IT management processes. Organizations have an example CI/CD pipeline with an enterprise-scale approach that helps to establishing a cloud operating model.

- **Lack of trust and desire for control**: The absence of a detailed cloud architecture that is compliant and a well-defined operating model to support such a platform leads IT to distrust Azure and instead try to maintain full control. This desire for control often involves building walls and complicated processes, which ultimately get in the way of business units adopting Azure. The goal is providing the right level of control to reduce friction of deploying workloads. Enterprise-scale landing zones build guardrails for governance and security that provide compliant and secure subscription landing zones for customer production workloads.

## What must be true for success

The following must be true to build a sustainable cloud platforms for an organization on Azure.

- **Platform architecture in production**: The key foundational services such as identity and access management, security, networking, monitoring, and shared infrastructure services must be in place.

  - An Azure-native-first design approach must be followed.
  - Architecture must be aligned with the Azure product lifecycle and roadmap.
  - Management and governance must be designed for scale.

- **Cloud operating model**: To support the platform architecture, a cross-functional capability combining engineering and operations must be in place. Cloud operation teams should have the required skillsets, understand best practices, and have a consistent toolset for day-to-day operations.

- **Democratization**: Subscriptions, aligned with the platform architecture, must be unblocked and provided to business units for the design, developing, and testing needed to migrate workloads.

- **Application-centric migration**: Support both existing application migrations and new application development, without discriminating between IaaS or PaaS, while providing a consistent experience for both AppOps (centrally managed applications) and DevOps (dedicated application teams) across the design and architecture outlined above.

## What must be designed and built

The following considerations are included in the scope of enterprise-scale architecture and reference implementation that organizations must address for successful cloud adoption.

- Platform operations and management
- Platform DevOps
- Subscription organization and governance
- Application landing zones
- Identity and access management
- Policy management
- Security and compliance
- Network topology and connectivity
- Shared services infrastructure
- Business continuity and disaster recovery
- Service management
- Service catalog

## Continuous engineering and migration

The design of an architectural platform approach is not enough. The organization must implement and maintain the platform. There is also a need for systematic architectural and technical delivery approach of what patterns must be built for success on the platform. The delivery team must build environments to the precise conditions that meet requirements and Azure best practices combined.

A continuous engineering loop must be developed to ensure environment lifecycles align with the Azure roadmap and provide validation of new services in the context of enterprise controls, and learnings must be channeled back to the platform.
