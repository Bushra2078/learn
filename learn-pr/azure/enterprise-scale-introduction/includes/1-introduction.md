In the context of an enterprise-scale architecture, a _landing zone_ is a logical construct capturing everything that must be true to enable application migrations and development at scale in Azure. These zones consider all platform resources that are required to support the customer's application portfolio. Azure landing zones provide cloud adoption teams with a well-managed environment for their workloads.

A good analogy for a landing zone is the set of services required to build a city. Before buildings can be erected and people move into them, essential services must be in place. Citizens and businesses need roads, water and sewer facilities, and power and gas infrastructure. The principle purpose of the landing zone is therefore to ensure that when an application or workload lands on Azure, the required _plumbing_ is already in place, providing greater agility and compliance with enterprise security and governance requirements. A major shift for a centralized IT organization in this scenario is moving from providing all the infrastructure (such as buildings for people to live in) to providing the zoning guidelines (guardrails established so other business units can build their infrastructure and applications).

One of the main benefits of the cloud is that you can scale resources on demand with almost no limit. You can also scaling down resources when they aren't needed. Just as you turn on a light when you need it and turn it off when you don't, the charges are incurred only for the electricity used while the light is on. Similarly, an organization can turn on an Azure resource when it's needed and turn it off when it's not. Azure provides broader options beyond on/off configurations, more like a knob on a light switch for adjusting how much light is needed at different times.

There is almost no capital cost associated with IT in the cloud, because hardware isn't being purchased to build a datacenter. Each resource is used on demand as needed. Because of this power to scale, governance problems arise. Governance and organization of many resources become challenging. Imagine a library with a pile of books with no markings or sorting process. When you need a particular book, it will be almost impossible to find. The library has to define the processes for sorting and returning a book to a prescribed location in the library. The same applies to resources in Azure subscriptions, which must be properly organized for operational efficiency. Enterprise-scale architecture provides a set of prescriptive and proven guidelines to define a sustainable platform architecture for landing zones. We build the landing zone so we know where to go and we provision resources when we need them. Just like in a library, when we go to pick up a book, we know where to go to find it and where to place it after we've used it. Landing zones help with the adoption of cloud and gives you a better way of organizing resources not just its type, but by organization, cost, and security.
