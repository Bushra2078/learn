Think of Azure Advisor as your own personal cloud consultant who understands the best practices for your particular cloud platform, and then provides you with recommendations to make your Azure workloads more efficient, more secure, more reliable, and better performing overall.

In this module, you've learned how Advisor provides you with the recommendations based on the five pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework:

- **Cost:** such as reporting idle or under-used services that can be deleted or downsized to save money
- **Security:** such as recommending multi-factor authentication settings for your users
- **Reliability:** such as recommending redundancy to keep your applications up and running
- **Operational Excellence:** such as providing your service health status, which can impact your applications
- **Performance:** such as scaling applications or upgrading resources to get better performance

You've learned through step-by-step examples how Advisor gives you *actionable* recommendations so that it is quick and easy for you to apply the fixes it recommends right from the Advisor dashboard. And lastly you've seen how you can use Advisor Score as a way to set target goals for optimizing your workloads and then track your progress over time.
