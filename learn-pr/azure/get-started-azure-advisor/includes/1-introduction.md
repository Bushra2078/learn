Do you have an idea where there might be waste or inefficiencies in your cloud environment? For that matter, do you know how you can find out?

Oftentimes, when building out a cloud solution in Azure, teams enlist different groups of people to set up the different services used, such as SQL databases and virtual machines. The typical result of this approach is that no one fully understands how overlooking certain configurations can negatively impact your cloud environment. For example, how much do you overspend each month on cloud services? And how secure is your platform?

With Azure Advisor, you can analyze your cloud environment to determine whether you are spending too much on your Azure services. You can also use Advisor to take a look at your security practices and have your cloud usage analyzed against industry best practices. 

## What is Advisor and how does it work?

Azure Advisor is a free service built into Azure that provides best practice recommendations for your workloads. These recommendations are personalized and actionable and help you assess your Azure workloads against the five pillars of the [Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/).

The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding principles that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. The framework consists of these five pillars of architecture excellence:
- Cost Optimization
- Operational Excellence
- Performance Efficiency
- Reliability
- Security

Advisor continuously analyzes your resources and cloud usage and then recommends solutions that can help you improve upon these five pillars.


## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Identify the different areas that Advisor looks at when making its recommendations
- Find Advisor in the Azure portal and view the recommendations for each area
- Understand the Advisor score and remediate the recommendations that Advisor offers
 
The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but they represent some important considerations when you're managing a solution on the cloud. For more details on Azure Advisor, visit the [Azure Advisor documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/).
