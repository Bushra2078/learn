Do you have an idea where there might be waste or inefficiencies in your cloud environment? Do your cloud deployments follow the latest proven best practices? For that matter, do you know how you can find out?

Oftentimes, when building out a cloud workload in Azure, teams enlist different groups of people to set up the different services used, such as SQL databases and virtual machines. Add to this the newness of cloud and rapid pace of change, and the typical result is misconfigurations that can negatively impact your cloud environment. For example, have you sized your virtual machines and SQL databases correctly based on your usage? And how secure is your platform?

With Azure Advisor, you can analyze your cloud environment to determine whether your workloads are following documented best practices for cost, security, reliability, performance, and operational excellence and then take action to make your workloads more effective and efficient.

## What is Advisor and how does it work?

Azure Advisor is a free service built into Azure that provides best practice recommendations for your workloads. These recommendations are personalized and actionable and help you assess your Azure workloads against the five pillars of the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/?azure-portal=true).

The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding principles that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. The framework consists of these five pillars of architecture excellence:

<!--
- Cost Optimization
- Operational Excellence
- Performance Efficiency
- Reliability
- Security
-->

Advisor continuously analyzes your resources and cloud usage and then recommends solutions that can help you improve your workloads against these five pillars.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Identify the different areas that Advisor looks at when making its recommendations
- Find Advisor in the Azure portal and view the recommendations for each area
- Remediate the issues that Advisorâ€™s recommendations have surfaced
- Understand the Advisor Score and how it can help prioritize recommendations and measure impacts

The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but they represent some important considerations when you're managing a solution on the cloud. For more details on Azure Advisor, visit the [Azure Advisor documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/?azure-portal=true).
