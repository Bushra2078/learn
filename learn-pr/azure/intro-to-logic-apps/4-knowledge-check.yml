  questions:
  
  - content: "What differentiates an _action_ from a _control action_?"
    choices:
    - content: "An action executes a task while a control action alters the control flow through your Logic App."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Actions and control actions both contain the word _action_ in their name; however, they do very different things. Actions represent tasks while control actions use Boolean expressions, loops, etc. to determine which actions are executed when your app runs."
    - content: "An action is a component that executes a task in a Logic App. A control action is a component that launches your Logic App."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The component that launches your app is called a trigger."
    - content: "An action is a component that launches your app while control actions are switch statements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Triggers are the component that launch your app. Control actions can be switch statements; however, they can also be other types of conditional logic."

  - content: "Which of the following is the **best** definition of Logic Apps?"
    choices:
    - content: "A cloud service that allows you to monitor social media and store data in Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can use a Logic App to monitor social media and store data in Azure but that's not a definition of the entire Logic Apps service."
    - content: "A cloud service in which you use pre-built connectors to build workflows."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can use pre-built connectors to build workflows with Logic apps, but you can also use custom connectors."
    - content: "A cloud service that automates the execution of business processes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Logic Apps is a cloud service that automates business processes."

  - content: "Suppose you work for a brokerage company and need to implement a system for trading of financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you will have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?"
    choices:
    - content: "High throughput"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Logic Apps scales out automatically. A Logic App can process large data sets in parallel and is very likely to be able to handle the throughput required by this system."
    - content: "Response time"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Minimizing execution time is critical in this system. Logic Apps does not offer low sub-second performance guarantees."
    - content: "Orchestrate the monitoring, detection, and execution tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Logic Apps is designed to integrate multiple systems."

  - content: "Suppose you work for a chain of athletic clubs and want to automate your lesson sign ups and notifications. You use a proprietary in-house customer management system to store customer phone numbers and email addresses. Logic Apps does not provide a connector for this customer management system. You want to use Logic Apps to automate this process, how can you accomplish this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the code view of the Logic Apps Designer to write Javascript code to interact with your proprietary system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The code view lets you edit the JSON definition of your workflow. It does not support writing executable code in a language like Javascript."
    - content: "Create a custom connector for the customer management system and use it in your Logic App."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Logic Apps is an extensible platform. You can create a REST API for your proprietary systems and build a custom connector that invokes that API."
    - content: "Logic apps are not the correct service to use and you should investigate different solutions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Logic Apps can be used even in cases where some services do not have a pre-built connector. This does mean it is your responsibility to write the connector."
