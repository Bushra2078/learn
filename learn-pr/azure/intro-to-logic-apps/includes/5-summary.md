Logic Apps are a cloud-hosted solution to run your business processes. They are completely serverless so there's no configuration or maintenance for you to do. You get automatic scaling of compute resources to handle spikes in your workload. They can automatically run multiple instances of your app to let you process large data sets in parallel.

Logic Apps are primarily targeted at integration scenarios. If you have multiple systems that you need to connect, then Logic Apps are likely to be a good option. An app can usually be created by anyone on your team that understands the business workflow; for example, a manager or a business analyst. This is especially true if there are pre-built connectors for every service you need to connect since there's no coding required.

The edge cases typically involve requirements like very low latency, complex logic, and whether you need to connect to non-standard services. The latency issue is the main one that's difficult to overcome, but the others are solvable using custom connectors or hybrid apps that mix Logic Apps with other solutions like Azure Functions. The following flowchart summarizes the key questions to guide the decision about whether Logic Apps are appropriate for your project.

![An illustration of a flowchart to help you decide whether to use Logic Apps. The flowchart indicates that Logic Apps work well when your project involves integrating multiple systems, does not require sub-second response times, does not include complex conditionals, and when there are connectors for all the systems you need to access.](../media-drafts/5-decide-whether-to-use-logic-apps-flowchart.png)
