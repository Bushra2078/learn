Logic Apps is a cloud-hosted solution to run your business processes. They run serverless so there's no configuration or maintenance for you to do. You get automatic scaling of compute resources to handle spikes in your workload. The execution engine can automatically run multiple instances of your app to let you process large data sets in parallel.

Logic Apps is primarily targeted at integration scenarios. If you have multiple systems that you need to connect, then Logic Apps is likely to be a good option. An app can usually be created by anyone on your team that understands the business workflow. Apps are especially easy to create when there are pre-built connectors for every service you need to connect since no coding is required.

The edge cases typically involve requirements like low latency, complex logic, and whether you need to connect to non-standard services. The latency issue is the main one that's difficult to overcome. The other issues are solvable with custom connectors or hybrid apps that mix Logic Apps with other solutions like Azure Functions. The following flowchart summarizes the key questions to guide the decision about whether Logic Apps is appropriate for your project.

![An illustration of a flowchart to help you decide whether to use Logic Apps. The flowchart summarizes the key questions to ask when evaluating Logic Apps for your work. First, does your project involve integrating multiple systems? Second, do you need low latency? Third, does your process include complex logic. Fourth, are there connectors for all the systems you need to access.](../media-drafts/5-decide-whether-to-use-logic-apps-flowchart.png)
