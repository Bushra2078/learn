In this module, you have:

- Identified the private and public IP addressing capabilities of Azure virtual networks.
- Identified how to integrate on-premises networks with Azure.
- Planned an IP address scheme for your Azure infrastructure and created virtual networks.

Now that you understand how to plan IP addressing for Azure networks, you understand the private and public IP addressing capabilities of Azure virtual networks. You can use this information to plan out the IP addressing for your own Azure infrastructure.
