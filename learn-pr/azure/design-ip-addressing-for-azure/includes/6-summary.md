In this module, you have:

- Identified the private & public IP addressing capabilities of Azure virtual networks.
- Identified how to integrate on-premises networks with Azure.
- Planned an IP address scheme for your Azure infrastructure.
- Set up virtual network to virtual network peering.

Now that you understand how to plan IP addressing for Azure networks, you understand the private & public IP addressing capabilities of Azure virtual networks. You also understand how to peer virtual networks together and you can use this cost-effective method in your Azure network infrastructure. The method enables low-latency communication between resources in virtual networks. It supports scenarios where resources are in different regions or subscriptions.
