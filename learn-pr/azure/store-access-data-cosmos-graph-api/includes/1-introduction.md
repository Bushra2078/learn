Many companies want to implement databases with strong relationships between different entities that can be traversed quickly. You can build such databases in Azure by using Azure Cosmos DB with the Graph API.

Suppose you're working as a developer for an e-commerce company and you've heard about graph database technology. You've been asked to undertake a study to see if a graph database is a fit for your data. Your directors want to know how graph databases can be built on Azure, and how to use a graph database from an application. You're interested in seeing how you can translate the current data model to a graph database, which holds entities such as customers, products, orders, and categories.

In this module, you'll learn how to create an application that uses an Azure Cosmos DB as a graph database. You'll also store, retrieve, and manipulate graph data and visualize it using Data Explorer.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Determine if a graph database fits the data needs of your application.
- Store data in a graph database from an application using the Gremlin API.
- Query data in a graph database from an application using the Gremlin API.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with creating and using Azure Cosmos DB
