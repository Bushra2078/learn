Azure Stack HCI provides highly resilient and performant software-defined storage.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a large US-based financial services company as a lead systems engineer. Your company develops highly specialized proprietary commercial applications for its customers and hosts those applications in its own datacenters.

As part of modernizing its technology, the company started deploying Azure Stack HCI across its on-premises locations. This has significantly accelerated datacenter consolidation, enhanced the agility of compute workloads, and helped minimize the dependency on expensive storage area networks (SANs) that are complex to manage.

As the company transitions from the SAN-based storage, it becomes necessary to ensure that the new infrastructure satisfies the performance and resiliency requirements of existing business-critical workloads. To make this transition as seamless as possible, you need to explore ways to maximize the software-defined architecture benefits offered by Azure Stack HCI. 

Your goal is to determine the optimal configuration and logical layout of physical storage devices. Your hope is to be able to match or even exceed SAN capabilities. 

You deployed an Azure Stack HCI unit into your proof-of-concept environment. Now, it’s time to research and evaluate the relevant software-defined storage functionality to determine the extent to which you can meet your goals.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you’ll explore the physical and logical components of Azure Stack HCI storage, their configuration, and management. You’ll also review a demonstration illustrating Azure Stack HCI drive replacement.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to describe the Azure Stack HCI storage physical and logical components and their characteristics. You’ll also have a better understanding of how to design, implement, and manage these components.
