Throughout the “Build Mixed Reality Digital Twins with Azure Digital Twin and Unity” learning path, you'll work with modified assets and operational data from a real wind farm. The wind farm is owned and operated by Enbridge, a Canadian energy company committed to expanding its low-carbon energy production and using technology to optimize its operations.  Your HoloLens 2 application will be focused on helping Enbridge expand and operate its low-carbon energy production wind farm in Canada, using Microsoft and Unity technology to create a functioning Digital Twin.

In this learning path, you'll create an application for the HoloLens 2 to receive data from an Azure Digital Twin (ADT) instance of a wind turbine, complete with operational sensor data.  You'll illustrate the value of connecting sensor data to your wind turbine Digital Twin in an immersive, data-rich experience.  The HoloLens 2 experience will enable you to visualize, monitor, and act on operation conditions on a wind power generating facility.  Specifically, you'll use Azure services to monitor the operational state of a set of wind turbines, observing power, ambient temperature, and simulated events.
