Originally known for its capabilities as a game engine, Unity is widely known as a real-time 3D platform used by game developers and industry professionals alike.  Unity will be the core development platform in this learning path that you'll use to create immersive Mixed Reality experiences for the HoloLens 2.  You'll use the Unity platform (Personal, Plus, Pro, or Enterprise versions) to build a 3D scene, import prebuilt assets / game objects known as Prefabs, connect the Unity scene to Azure Digital Twin services that stream operational data, and then build a User Experience and deploy it to the HoloLens.
