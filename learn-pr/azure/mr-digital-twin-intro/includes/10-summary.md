In this module, you learned about some of the foundational technology Enbridge will use to create a Digital Twin of one of its wind farms.  Connecting operation IoT data to a digital representation of wind turbines using Azure Digital Twin and Unity, you saw how the creation of a Digital Twin Mixed Reality experience can create an immersive experience for operators.  You learned how a Digital Twin becomes a powerful tool to interact with real-time or right-time data using Azure SignalR.
