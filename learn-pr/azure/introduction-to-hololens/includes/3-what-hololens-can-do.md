#### Engineering and construction

With Mixed Reality, architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms are empowered to overcome design, modeling, collaboration, and building site challenges to enhance project quality, decision-making, improve productivity. For example, AEC firms have reduced rework by 75 percent, saving $44 per hour<sup>1</sup>. 

Common scenarios in which AEC organizations benefit from mixed reality on Microsoft HoloLens 2:

1. **Clash detection**: Enable onsite workers to preemptively identify issues, detect clashes, and gain buy-in of onsite workers and key stakeholders with overlay designs on physical locations. This mitigates late-stage design changes that could result in rework, budget overrun, and project delays.
1. **3D plan and model demonstrations**: Empower project leaders, designers, and engineers and improve customer service and sales with 3D demonstration and immersive visualizations.
Self-guided learning: Equip onsite workers to view task instructions, essential data, and model visualizations while in the flow of work, increasing speed, quality, and safety.

*“We use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens 2 to work more effectively and share expertise at critical milestones. This not only saves us money but also helps us construct data centers for our customers more quickly.”* — Microsoft. Read the full customer story<sup>2</sup>.

#### Healthcare organizations

Healthcare providers are faced with a unique challenge: the work itself is hands-on, but any training that takes place in an authentic environment runs the risk of adversely impacting patient care. Using HoloLens to train healthcare workers allows them to learn how to examine, diagnose, treat patients, and practice technical surgical skills in a low-risk simulated environment that is devoid of real-life consequences. 

Mixed reality is empowering providers, payors, and health science experts to reimagine healthcare by accelerating diagnoses, reducing time-to-care, and enabling personalization. Using Microsoft mixed reality, healthcare providers reduced average consumables by 80%, saving $4,000 per trainee<sup>1</sup>.
