Microsoft HoloLens 2 is an untethered holographic computer. It refines the holographic computing journey started by HoloLens (1st gen) to provide a more comfortable and immersive experience paired with more options for collaborating in mixed reality. HoloLens runs on the Windows Holographic OS, which is based on a "flavor" of Windows 10 that provides users, admins, and developers with a robust, performant, secure, and manageable at-scale platform.

The headset is ergonomic â€“ light and untethered, allowing free movement without wires or external packs. Workers using HoloLens can collaborate heads-up and hands-free, making it easy to act with precision and increase productivity, removing any physical restrictions of ordinarily computing that prevent or delay completion of common tasks. Users can use voice commands or hand tracking to touch, grasp, and manipulate holograms and digital content, which can persist over time and space.

## HoloLens components

HoloLens 2 has four visible light cameras for head tracking, two infrared cameras for eye tracking, a time-of-flight depth sensor, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), an 8MP stills and 1080p30 video camera, plus a 5-channel microphone array and built-in spatial sound speakers. The compute platform comprises a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 chip set, a custom 2nd-generation HPU (holographic processing unit), 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. Connectivity is via Wi-Fi (802.11ac) and Bluetooth 5.0.
