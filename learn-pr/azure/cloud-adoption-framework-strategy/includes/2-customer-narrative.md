We shared the narrative for Tailwind Traders in the Getting Started module and other Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) Learn modules. This module is the first step towards Tailwind's cloud adoption journey. The team is evaluating their strategic direction and ensuring stakeholder buy-in before committing to the cloud effort.

The following excerpts from the customer narrative, outline strategic objectives for Tailwind.

## Innovation objectives

Like most customers, Tailwind Traders is attempting to balance two competing business drivers: digital transformation and mitigate risk.

The Tailwind Traders retail innovation team uses technology to continually redefine the company's position as a leader in modern commerce. Those technology solutions are the primary hub for interactions with customers. Those solutions affect 60 percent of global revenue and produce 30 percent of annual gross sales. A few examples of those innovations include:

- **Boundless commerce:** Originally a simple e-commerce solution, this custom-built platform now provides online and offline experiences for customers. Purchases can be made from the platform. The mobile app gathers information from the customer's viewing history to customize the retail experience with in-store ads, shopping lists, and other interactions.
- **Analytics, AI, and robotics innovation:** The team is experimenting with drone delivery, autonomous warehousing, and other AI lead approaches to reduce costs, scale through automation, and improve customer experiences. These experiments are built on big data, analytics, and AI solutions.

## Migration objectives

Beyond new innovations, Tailwind Traders' central IT teams support the back office and store technologies. The company's central IT team supports 3,500 employees, and less than 100 are dedicated to IT. The IT team represents the majority of the technical staff, with roughly 80 employees focused on supporting the following types of technologies:

- **Smart storefronts:** Environmental controls, doors, lighting, interactive shelves, in-store displays and advertisements, and over 500 point of sales systems.
- **Corporate headquarters:** More than 900 employees are hosted in corporate headquarters with technology systems covering best of breed solutions to support processes across real estate, logistics, supply chain, pricing, human resources, employee schedules/tracking, payroll, etc.
- **End-user workstations:** Mostly desktop-based with a growing percentage of employees opting for mobile, BYOD (bring you own device), in-store kiosks, and virtual desktop solutions.
- **Central operations:** The IT team provides ongoing technical operations for all IT and retail innovations assets.

Tailwind Traders currently has three datacenters. The leases for two of their datacenters are due to run out in 18 months and 2 years. The IT manager and finance director have been talking, and they don't want to renew the leases. Instead they are looking at doing a project that will upgrade, consolidate, and use the cloud as a replacement datacenter. The new CIO is using this project as an opportunity to rethink IT operations.

## Strategic priorities

The CIO of Tailwind Traders has recently retired. The new CIO is focused on improving technical operations in a number of areas to fuel greater innovation throughout the company while limiting disruptions to core business operations. The cloud will play an important role in this transition.

_Figure 4: The shift in IT operations._

A cornerstone of this strategy will be a shift in the operating model, moving from a centralized command and control operating model to a model that focuses on delegated responsibilities led by a cloud center of excellence team. This transition is expected to take several years. The CIO will be looking for small incremental steps to transition in each of the coming projects.

Transitioning to this new operating model is expected to reduce vendor complexity and the overall cost of operations. The CIO will use the redistributed savings to further accelerate technical and operational capabilities, increasing IT's position as an innovation leader across the business.
