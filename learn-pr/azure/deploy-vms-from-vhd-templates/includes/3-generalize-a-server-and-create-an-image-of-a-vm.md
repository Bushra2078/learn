You've learnt about what the Azure images are and how you can customize them. Now you're ready to start learning about how you can create an image of a Windows and Linux VM.

In this unit, you'll learn how to customize an image and then create a virtual machine from that image using Powershell.  You'll learn about the different methods you can use to create customized images and how you can deploy these.

## Generalize a server and create an image of a VM

---

The method of generalizing an image depends upon the operating system. If you are building a Windows VHD, you can use the **sysprep** utility. Sysprep removes server specfic information from the image which allows you to use that image for mass deployment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running **sysprep** is a potentially destructive process and you cannot easily revers its effects. Backup your virtual machine first.

To generalize a Windows VM, follow these steps:

- Login into the Windows virtual machine.
- Open a command prompt as an administrator.
- Browse to the directory *\windows\system32\sysprep*.
- Run **sysprep.exe**.
- In the System Preparation Tool dialog box, select the following settings, and then click **OK**.

    | Property  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | System Cleanup Action | Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) |
    | Generalize | Check  |
    | Shutdown Options | Shutdown |

Once you have generalized the VM, you can then create an image.  By creating an image, it  ensures that the image includes all of the disks associated with the VM.

You can create an image from the generalized VM using either the Azure portal or powershell

You can generalize a Windows server by using sysprep.  Running sysprep on a Windows server will removed all the GUID details and hostnames and make that server OS unique, which you can then deploy multiple VMs.

To generalize a Windows VM:
- Login to your Windows VM.
- Open a Command Prompt window and change the directory to %windir%\system32\sysprep. Run sysprep.exe.
- Select Shutdown.

You can then use either the Azure portal or Powershell to create an image of this generalized server.

In the Azure portal perform the below:

- Select the Virtual machine
- On the Virtual machine page,  select Capture.
- From the Create image page, fill in all the boxes or accept the precreated entries
- If you want to delete the source VM after the image has been created, select Automatically delete 

In Powershell, you can:
- Create an image of a VM
- Create an image from a managed disk
- Create an image from a snapshot
- Create an image from a VHD in a storage account

### Linux VMs

To generalize a Linux VM, you would use the Azure CLI to capture and generalize the Linux VM.
To capture a linux VM, perform the below steps:

- SSH into the Linux server and type the following command:
 
        `sudo waagent â€“deprovision+user`

This command cleans the system and makes it ready for reprovisioning. The below tasks are completed by actioning this command:
 
- Removes SSH host keys
- Clears nameserver configuration 
- Removes the root user's password 
- Removes DHCP client leases
- Sets host name to localhost.localdomain
- Deletes the last provisioned user account

To generalize the VM run the command:

        `azure vm generalize 

### Approaches to creating an image

Images can be created in a variety of ways:

- Via the Portal Open the Azure portal.
In the menu on the left, select Virtual machines and then select the VM from the list.
- In the Virtual machine page for the VM, on the upper menu, select Capture.
- The Create Image page appears.
- For Name, either accept the pre-populated name or enter a name that you would like to use for the image.
- For Resource group, either select Create new and enter a name, or select Use existing and select a resource group to use from the drop-down list.
- If you want to delete the source VM after the image has been created, select Automatically delete this virtual machine after creating the image.
- If you want the ability to use the image in any availability zone, select On for Zone resiliency.
Select Create to create the image.
- After the image is created, you can find it as an Image resource in the list of resources in the resource group.
Using PowerShell Link
- From a snapshot created, this gives you the ability to failback as you still have the original VHD.
