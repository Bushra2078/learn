## Role(s)

- Solution architect
- Administrator

## Level

- Beginner

## Product(s)

- Azure virtual machines
- Sysprep â€“ used to generalize a Windows VM
- Azure managed disks

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure virtual machines

## Summary

Standardize and automate your virtual machine deployments to minimize manual configuration, variance, and error.

## Learning objectives

- Identify the methods to create a specialized VHD
- Create a virtual machine from an existing managed disk
- Create a virtual machine image
- Create a virtual machine from an existing virtual machine image

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Deploy Azure virtual machines from VHD templates*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- |---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    An organization is building out a new environment on Azure that uses virtual machines. They would like to have a customized image with their organizational standards included, and need a method to store and create virtual machines from these images.

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type
    
 1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    1. Step
    1. Step

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?
