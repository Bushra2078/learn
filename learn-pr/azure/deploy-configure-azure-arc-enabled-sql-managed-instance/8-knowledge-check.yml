      explanation: "Try again. This database is automatically backed up."
    - content: "User database in Simple Recovery Model"

    - content: "User auditing data"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Usage data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Usage data is required to be uploaded for billing purposes."

    - content: "Deploying the Business Critical Tier, choosing for development use only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Development use isn't for production use."
