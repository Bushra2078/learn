**[Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview?view=azuresql&preserve-view=true)** is an intelligent, scalable cloud database service that combines the broadest SQL Server database engine compatibility with all the benefits of a fully managed and evergreen platform as a service.

Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance (MI) provides nearly the same features, functionality, and user experience as Azure SQL MI, except it runs on your chosen hardware, on your version-supported kubernetes cluster inside your data center or multi-cloud environment.

Arc-enabled SQL MI has the following Features and Capabilities:
-	**[Supported Features and Services]((/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features)**
    - **[RDBMS High Availability]((/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#RDBMSHA)**
    - **[RDBMS Scalability and Performance]((/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#RDBMSSP)**
    - **[RDBMS Security]((/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#RDBMSS)**
    - **[RDBMS Manageability]((/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#RDBMSM)**
    - **[Programmability]((/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#Programmability)**
    - **[Tools]((/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#tools)**
-	**[Unsupported Features and Services](/azure/azure-arc/data/managed-instance-features#Unsupported)**

## Service Tiers

Arc-enabled SQL MI is available in two (2) vCore Service tiers:

- **General Purpose** is a budget-friendly tier designed for most workloads with common performance and availability features.
- **Business Critical** is designed for performance-sensitive workloads with higher availability features.

<!-- As Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance runs on your hardware inside your chosen data center, no guaranteed SLAs are provided for storage or compute. You get the flexibility to bring your own performant hardware to meet your SLAs. -->

## Feature comparison

Arc-enabled SQL MI provides all the same built-in capabilities as Azure SQL MI and SQL Server. You can take advantage of the most important features that Azure SQL MI and SQL Server have to offer, thanks to Arc-enabled SQL MI sharing a common code base with the latest version of SQL Server.

At this time, there is a small subset of unsupported features when using Arc-enabled SQL MI. Microsoft is constantly working to improve feature parity, so these limitations may be resolved over time:

- **[Backup and Restore](/azure/azure-arc/data/limitations-managed-instance#backup-and-restore)** 
<!--    - **Automated backups**
        - User databases in Simple Recovery model are not backed up.
        - Model database is not backed up.
    - **Point-in-time restore**
        - Does not support database restores across Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instances. Can only restore to the same Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance where the backup was created.
        - Restoring TDE-enabled databases is not supported.
        - Restoring a deleted database is not supported. -->
- **[Data transfer technologies](/azure/azure-arc/data/limitations-managed-instance#other-limitations)**
<!--    - Transactional replication is not supported.
    - Log shipping is currently blocked. -->
