In this unit, you will learn how to work with blades in the Azure portal user interface (UI). You can either use your own account (if you have one, or created one), or use the free Azure sandbox.

If you have an account (or created one), then Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) using your account credentials

Otherwise, **activate the Azure sandbox above** and sign into the [Azure portal for sandbox](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you activated the sandbox with.

## Working with blades

Once you are logged into the Azure portal, we can start exploring things.

1. Let's start by touring how to create a resource. In the left-hand pane, click **Create a resource**.

1. The **New** blade displays a list of categories of items to create on the left-hand side, with the **Get started** option selected. This is like the "Favorites" menu, with some of the most common options visible. Under **Get started**, you have the option to create resources such as a Windows Server 2016 VM, an Ubuntu Server VM, a web app, a SQL database, and so on. Each of these items includes a quickstart tutorial.

1. Click **Quickstart tutorial** under Windows Server 2016 VM. This lists the Windows VM tutorials. Close this new tab to return to the Azure portal.

## Viewing resources

1. Under Azure Marketplace, click **Compute** to show more compute options, such as Red Hat Enterprise, Reserved VM instances, Web app for Containers, and so on. This list is a subset of the entire range of computing resources available.

2. To the right of **Featured**, click **See all** to see the full range of available resources. The full list of VMs now appears.

3. Under **Recommended**, click **Windows Server**. The **Windows Server** blade appears.

4. To the right of the **Pin** icon, click the **Maximize** icon. The Windows Server blade now fills the screen, except for the left-hand pane. Scroll down the list to see the other Windows Server images available.

5. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Windows Server** blade.

## Filtering results

1. To refine this list further, on the **Compute** blade, click **Filter**. The **Filter** blade now appears.

2. Select the filter option for **Virtual Machine Images**, and then click **Done**.

3. Click the **X** in the top right-hand corner of the **Filter** blade.

1. On the **Compute** blade, look down the list of available VM images and then, at the bottom, click **Load More**.

1. Continue to click **Load More** a few times to appreciate just how many types of VMs Azure provides.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Compute** blade.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Marketplace** blade.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **New** blade.

The default dashboard now appears.
