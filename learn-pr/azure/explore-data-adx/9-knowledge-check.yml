quiz:
  questions: 
  - content: "How can you identify the types of data in each column of your dataset?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the `getschema` operator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `getschema` operator returns the schema of the dataset, which contains each column name and its data type."
    - content: "Use the `render` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `render` operator returns a visualization of the dataset."
    - content: "Highlight the columns and look at the summary in the results grid."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The highlighted cells will show a summary in the bottom right corner of the results grid. This is useful for integer values, but doesn't give a complete list of datatypes for each column."
  - content: "How can you easily find the min/max and average of a selection of integer cells in the results grid?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sort the results grid by the desired column."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorting by a column rearranges the rows according to the values in that column, but doesn't help with finding the min/max or average."
    - content: "Use the `render` operator to plot the column and eyeball the results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't a precise method to find the min/max or average."
    - content: "Highlight the cells and look at the summary in the bottom corner of the results grid."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ""
  - content: "How can you check if a time series is missing data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Count how many rows are present in the time series."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Count is only a meaningful test if you know how many rows to expect."
    - content: "Take a sample of 10 rows of data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Reducing the available data won't tell you if there's missing data."
    - content: "Plot the count of events vs. time to see if any data is missing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This visualization will help you determine if there's missing data."
