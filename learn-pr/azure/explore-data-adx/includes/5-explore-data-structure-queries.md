## Explore data structure using queries

Once you've answered basic characterization questions, you'll be able to drill down into the dataset to find trends in the data.

For example: How does the data vary with time? How does the data vary by region? This process is usually iterative, as the results from one query will prompt new queries and searches.

## Share insights

Finally, you'll want to share your findings with others. Maybe you'll want to share a single query, or visualization result. Alternatively, you could share a whole dashboard. Communication is the final, important step of data exploration.

This process is a general pattern of data exploration for any new dataset, regardless of the specific structure and information it contains. The tools built into Azure Data Explorer can help you streamline this process and quickly move from unfamiliar data to shared insights.
