What happens when you get a new dataset? In order to run complex queries and communicate insights from the data, you first need to explore the dataset itself and know what information is available to you. Characterizing the data will help you understand what kinds of questions you can ask.

## Initial exploration 

Suppose you're looking at an unfamiliar table of meterological data. At first, you'll want to answer questions like:

- What information is part of this data? 
- How many entries are in this table?
- What is the range of entries?
- What are the data types of the entries?
- Is the dataset part of a time series?
- Is the dataset complete? Are there time or location gaps?
- How can grouping certain fields help me understand the data?

Some of these questions can be answered by looking at a sample of the data. Some of these questions will require grouping, or aggregating the data. Other questions are best understood by visualizing the results.
