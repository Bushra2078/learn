Azure Arc promises to bridge the gap between on-premises and cloud environments. Azure Arc provides a consistent operational approach with the agility, automation, and scalability of the Azure platform and its services. In this module, you'll learn about Azure Arc-enabled servers’ security capabilities.  

Suppose you’re the Chief Information Security Officer at Tailwind Traders, a small commodities trading firm. As your company invests in its hybrid and multicloud environment, it has onboarded its machines to Azure Arc-enabled servers. To mitigate the risk of prospective cyberattacks and vulnerabilities, you're interested in more holistic solutions capable of securing your organization’s distributed IT infrastructure. 

Through Azure Arc-enabled servers, you can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Defender for Servers, and Microsoft Sentinel to deliver robust security across your environment. With a blend of these Azure Services, you can facilitate a more holistic security strategy. Azure Arc enables you to deliver security posture management, threat intelligence, and workload protection across servers anywhere.
