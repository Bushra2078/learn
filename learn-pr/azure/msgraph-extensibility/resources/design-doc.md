1. Introduction

    A multinational with subsidiaries across continents and hundreds of employees across each subsidiary uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 for identity and access management, collaboration, and security. The company has deployed a team bonding mobile app that allows employees to discover each other and connect within and through their external social networks.

    The company wants to allow employees to share bits about themselves so their colleagues can discover them in public social networks. The company doesnâ€™t want to invest in another database. Because of Microsoft Graph's extensibility options, the company will use Microsoft Graph to store this lightweight information and allow each employee the privilege to fully manage and own their data.
