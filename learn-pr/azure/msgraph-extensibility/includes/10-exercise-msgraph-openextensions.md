In the team bonding app scenario, you need to allow each employee to add their public LinkedIn profile URL, Skype ID, and Xbox gamertag.

In this exercise, you'll use an API client such as [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) to make REST API requests to Microsoft Graph and manage the open extensions on the **user** resource. The commands in this exercise emulate the API calls that the team bonding app makes on behalf of the signed-in user.

## Authenticate your session

Sign in to Graph Explorer or another API client with the *User Administrator* Azure AD role.

Consent to the *User.ReadWrite.All* Microsoft Graph permission to perform the API operations in this exercise.

In the team bonding app, the employee will sign in with their Azure AD profile and must consent to the *User.Read.All* and *User.ReadWrite.All* Microsoft Graph permissions to allow them to discover their colleagues and update their own profile information.

## Conclusion

You have used Microsoft Graph open extension properties to store three custom values. You've seen how to retrieve those values or remove any values from the properties.
