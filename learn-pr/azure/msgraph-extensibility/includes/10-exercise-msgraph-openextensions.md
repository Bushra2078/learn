In the team bonding app scenario, you need to allow each employee to add their public LinkedIn profile URL, Skype ID, and Xbox gamertag.

In this exercise, you'll use an API client such as [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) to make REST API requests to Microsoft Graph and manage the open extensions on the **user** resource. The commands in this exercise emulate the API calls that the team bonding app makes on behalf of the signed-in user.

## Conclusion

You have used Microsoft Graph open extension properties to store three custom values. You've seen how to:
+ Retrieve those values or remove any values from the properties.
+ Implement a custom search so employees in the company can discover each other's external social profiles.

After this exercise, Adele's social profiles are undiscoverable through the team bonding app. Other users may decide to share all three pieces of data or none. For each type of operation, you can implement the appropriate logic in the team bonding app to translate successful response codes to user-friendly response messages in the user interface.
