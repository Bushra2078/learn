GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models from OpenAI are prompt-based. With prompt-based models, the user interacts with the model by entering a text prompt, to which the model responds with a text completion.

In this module, you gained an overview of Azure OpenAI and the types of completions that you can use. Completions such as classifications, translations, conversations, and so on.

The quality of the model's completion depends on the quality of the prompt that you give to it. You learned quite a bit about the prompt's components and how to optimize the prompt to produce high-quality completions.

Along the way, we created a .NET console application using the .NET Azure OpenAI SDK. That SDK follows the conventions of the other Azure SDKs so you can feel at home using it quickly.

You should now have a basic understanding of both completions and prompts to start your journey in building OpenAI-powered applications with .NET.
