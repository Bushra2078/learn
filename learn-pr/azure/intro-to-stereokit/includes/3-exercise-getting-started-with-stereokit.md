Now that we understand what StereoKit is and how we can use it to overcome complex game engine structures. Let's start installing all the tools required for working with StereoKit. In this chapter, you'll learn how to install StereoKit with its template and enable Developer Mode on your device, PC, and HoloLens 2.

Here's a quick list of what is required to start developing with StereoKit:

* **[Visual Studio 2019 or 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)** with the following packages installed,
  * .NET Desktop development
  * Universal Windows Platform development (for HoloLens)
  * Mobile development with .Net (for Quest)

* **[StereoKit’s Visual Studio Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NickKlingensmith.StereoKitTemplates)**

  * Experienced users might directly use the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StereoKit).

* **Any OpenXR runtime**
  * A flatscreen fallback is available for development.

* **Enable Developer Mode (for UWP/HoloLens)**

## Install Visual Studio 2019

1. **Download** the free edition of **[Visual Studio Community](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads)**.

2. Save the **Visual Studio installer** to your device path. Once the download is complete, you can start the installation process by running the Visual Studio installer.

3. Once your Visual Studio starts to install, you'll see a few seconds of initialization followed by a feature selection option. First, select the **.NET Desktop development** and **Universal Windows Platform development (for HoloLens)** checkbox in Visual Studio 2019's features list. Then, after making the required selections, click the **Modify** button.

4. After you click **Modify**, Visual Studio proceeds to download and install the features you've specified. Later, You'll be asked to **Restart** your computer when the installation process is complete. Next, launch your Visual Studio to verify the installation was successful.

## StereoKit's Visual Studio template

StereoKit's visual studio template is the quickest method for you to start a StereoKit project. By default, it has been set to copy project assets correctly also includes some basic code that gives you a bit of functionality to start right away and test.

There are two templates provided:

1. **Universal Windows Platform** - is for HoloLens 2, and it can also run on Windows desktop. However, UWP can be slower to compile, and it will not receive updates from the .NET team.
2. **.NET Core** - is used for desktop XR on Windows and Linux. It is simple to use, compiles quickly, and is the best option for most developers.

3. **Cross Platform Template (in development)** - This is a pre-production version that is still in project format. It uses a DLL shared across several platform-specific applications to work with .Net Core, UWP, and Xamarin(Android/Quest) all at once.

4. **Native C++ Template (in development)** - StereoKit does offer a C API, however it should only be used by experienced developers if the benefits exceed the lack of documentation.

> [!Note]
>Iteration is slower with Universal Windows Platform because it builds apps, so use it only if HoloLens is essential to you.
>You may also install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StereoKit) directly into your project.

### Download & install StereoKit's Visual Studio template

1. Download the StereoKit templates from [StereoKit Templates - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NickKlingensmith.StereoKitTemplates).

## Enable Developer Mode

Enabling Developer Mode in **HoloLens 2** & **Windows PC** makes it easier to test the ready applications. In addition to this, you can install Universal Windows Platform & Windows apps from outside the Windows Store, even if it is a valid certificate without the sign. That is an essential feature for app developers who want to test their apps on their PCs while still developing.

### Enable developer mode for HoloLens 2

1. Switch on your **HoloLens 2** and put it on. Then, access the main menu by using the start gesture.

2. To start the app in your environment, select the **Settings** tile.

3. Select the **Update and Security** option from the menu.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/hololens-update-security.png" alt-text=" The screenshot of Update & Security menu item." lightbox="../media/hololens-update-security.png":::

4. Select the menu item **For developers**.

5. Enable **Use developer features** to deploy apps from Visual Studio to your HoloLens. If your device is running Windows Holographic version 21H1 or newer, enable **Device discovery** also.

6. Optional: Scroll down and enable Device Portal, which allows you to connect to your HoloLens Windows **Device Portal** from a web browser.
