StereoKit is basically a code-first library aimed particularly at engineers and others who are accustomed to working in code-first environments. This appeals to an extensive number of non-game C# developers. Visual Studio developers can continue operating as they have in the past, utilizing NuGet's extensive functionality.

StereoKit focuses on non-game Mixed Reality use cases, making it a better fit for people developing more traditional applications. This is why, unlike game engines, StereoKit's asset pipeline operates at runtime rather than build time. In addtion it also focuses on Mixed Reality making it much easier to create high-quality MR experiences and performs MR operations natively using basic core APIs while considering the limitations of stereo, performance-critical smartphone rendering. This is a great oppourtunity for those who don't want to understand the overhead of a difficult game engine structure or learn game engine or become graphics engineers.

## StereoKit key features

* You can access StereoKit on platforms like HoloLens 2, Oculus Quest, Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Desktop, SteamVR, Varjo, Monado Linux, and eventually, everywhere OpenXR is.

* The StereoKit model format must be in .gltf, .glb, .obj, .stl, ASCII.ply and procedural.

* The StereoKit Texture format must be in .jpg, .png, .tga, .bmp, .psd, .gif, .hdr, .pic, equirectangular cubemap, procedural.

* Stereokit builds your app to a device in a matter of seconds.

* Stereokit supports flat screen mode with input emulation, powerful UI and interactions for easy development.

* Assets are loaded at runtime, allowing computations to proceed faster.

* Physics - It enables the 3D object to function as a real-world object, along with all physical constraints.

* StereoKit, by default, uses a Flexible shader or material system with a built-in PBR.
