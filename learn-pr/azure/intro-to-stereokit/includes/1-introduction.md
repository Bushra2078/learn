StereoKit prioritizes the development of Mixed Reality apps. It is an open-source Mixed Reality framework used to develop HoloLens and VR apps with C# and OpenXR. It comes with a first-class Mixed Reality input system, excellent performance even on mobile devices. It also supports fast on-device iteration time and a runtime asset pipeline allowing users and developers to load actual files from the file system. Furthermore, the well-documented, easy-to-learn, and easy-to-build API includes the functionalities mentioned above and much more.

Imagine a scenario wherein you need to build a Mixed Reality application with a fast user experience, stylish visuals, and a realistic environment. But you are aware that all the power required to create cutting-edge visuals will open up new ways to ruin your application performance. You may easily use StereoKit's features in such situations. StereoKit takes care of this performance problem by focusing on the smaller portions of the rendering process. It employs an instanced rendering pipeline with a reduced lighting model that prioritizes performance above a lofty goal.

StereoKit is a code-first library aimed initially at engineers and others working on similar platforms. StereoKit concerns a large number of non-game C# developers. Visual Studio Developers can continue working as they have in the past, using NuGet's extended functionality.

In this module, you'll understand some of the features of StereoKit. Also, we will learn how easy it is to use in your development process. You'll also learn about a demo application called StereoKit Ink to understand the implementations of StereoKit.
