Welcome to the StereoKit module! You'll learn how to set up StereoKit for Mixed Reality development with its key features and build Mixed Reality applications for different platforms.

StereoKit is a code-first library aimed initially at engineers and others who work on a similar platform. StereoKit concerns a large number of non-game C# developers. Visual Studio developers can continue working as they have in the past, using NuGet's extended functionality.

Suppose you want to build an application without using any game engines. Instead, you can use StereoKit to develop your Mixed Reality applications.

You can develop custom applications using StereoKit as it focuses on non-game Mixed Reality use cases. You can also create high-quality Mixed Reality experiences using StereoKit. Furthermore, you can perform Mixed Reality operations natively using basic core APIs. Also, StereoKit helps you to overcome the complex game engine structures.

## StereoKit key features

* You can use StereoKit on OpenXR platforms such as HoloLens 2, Oculus Quest, Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Desktop, SteamVR, Varjo, and Monado Linux.

* The StereoKit 3D model format must be in gltf, glb, obj, stl, ascii ply, and procedural.

* The StereoKit image or texture format must be in jpg, png, tga, bmp, psd, gif, hdr, pic, equirectangular cubemap, and procedural.

* StereoKit builds your application to a device in a matter of time.

* StereoKit supports flat-screen mode with input emulation, powerful UI, and interactions for easy development.

* Assets are loaded at runtime, allowing faster computations.

* Physics enables the 3D object to function as a real-world object, along with all physical constraints.

* By default StereoKit, uses a flexible shader or material system with a built-in PBR.
