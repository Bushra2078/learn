StereoKit is an open-source mixed reality library that makes it simple to create HoloLens and VR applications using C# and OpenXR! StereoKit puts mixed reality app development first. Features include a first-class mixed reality input system, high performance by default even on mobile devices, quick iteration time on-device, and a runtime asset pipeline that allows users and developers to load actual files from the file system. Furthermore, these features and more are contained within a concise API that is well-documented, simple to learn, and simple to build!

Imagine a scenario wherein you are asked to build a Mixed Reality application with a fast user experience, stylish visuals, photo real effects, and a realistic environment. But you are aware that all that power to build cutting-edge visuals will provide you with many opportunities to ruin your application performance. You may easily use StereoKit's features in such situations. StereoKit takes care of this disadvantage by concentrating on a smaller portion of the rendering process. It employs an instanced rendering pipeline with a reduced lighting model that prioritizes performance above a lofty goal.

StereoKit is a code-first library aimed initially at engineers and others who work on a similar platform. StereoKit concerns a large number of non-game C# developers. Visual Studio developers can continue working as they have in the past, using NuGet's extended functionality.

In this module, you'll understand some of the features of StereoKit and learn how easy it is to use it in your development process. You'll also learn about a demo application called StereoKit Ink to understand the implementations of StereoKit better.
