Welcome to the StereoKit module! You'll learn how to set up StereoKit for Mixed Reality development and build Mixed Reality applications for different platforms. In addition, you'll learn about some of the key features of StereoKit.

StereoKit is a code-first library aimed primarily at engineers and others who work in smiliar environments. This concerns to a large number of non-game C# developers. Visual Studio developers can continue working as they have in the past, using NuGet's extended functionality.

Suppose you want to build an application without using any game engine such as unity and unreal. So in such a scenario, you can use StereoKit to develop your Mixed Reality applications.

StereoKit focuses on non-game Mixed Reality use cases, making it a better fit for people developing custom applications. In addition, you can create high-quality Mixed Reality experiences using StereoKit. It performs Mixed Reality operations natively using basic core APIs while considering the limitations. You can also overcome the complex game engine structures.

## StereoKit key features

* You can access StereoKit on OpenXR platforms such as HoloLens 2, Oculus Quest, Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Desktop, SteamVR, Varjo, Monado Linux.

* The StereoKit 3D model format must be in .gltf, .glb, .obj, .stl, ASCII.ply, and procedural.

* The StereoKit image or texture format must be in .jpg, .png, .tga, .bmp, .psd, .gif, .hdr, .pic, equirectangular cubemap, procedural.

* StereoKit builds your application to a device in a matter of seconds.

* StereoKit supports flat screen mode with input emulation, powerful UI, and interactions for easy development.

* Assets are loaded at runtime, thus allowing faster computations.

* Physics enables the 3D object to function as a real-world object, along with all physical constraints.

* StereoKit, by default, uses a flexible shader or material system with a built-in PBR.
