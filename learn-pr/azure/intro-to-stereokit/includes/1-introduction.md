Welcome to the StereoKit module! You'll learn how to set up StereoKit for Mixed Reality development and build Mixed Reality applications for different platforms. You'll also learn some of the key features of StereoKit.

StereoKit is a code-first library aimed primarily at engineers and others who work in similar environments. StereoKit concerns a large number of non-game C# developers. Visual Studio developers can continue working as they have in the past, using NuGet's extended functionality.

Suppose you want to build an application without using any game engines such as unity and unreal. These game engines are vast, complex, and full of constraints; it is tedious for a regular user to build a small application. So in such a scenario, you can use StereoKit to develop your Mixed Reality applications.

You can develop custom applications using StereoKit as it focuses on non-game Mixed Reality use cases. You can also create high-quality Mixed Reality experiences using StereoKit. Furthermore, you can perform Mixed Reality operations natively using basic core APIs. Also, StereoKit helps You to overcome the complex game engine structures.

## StereoKit key features

* You can use StereoKit on OpenXR platforms such as HoloLens 2, Oculus Quest, Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Desktop, SteamVR, Varjo, and Monado Linux.

* The StereoKit 3D model format must be in ".gltf", ".glb", ".obj", ".stl", "ASCII.ply", and "procedural".

* The StereoKit image or texture format must be in ".jpg", ".png", ".tga", ".bmp", ".psd", ".gif", ".hdr", ".pic", "equirectangular cubemap", and "procedural".

* StereoKit builds your application to a device in a matter of seconds.

* StereoKit supports flat-screen mode with input emulation, powerful UI, and interactions for easy development.

* Assets are loaded at runtime, allowing faster computations.

* Physics enables the 3D object to function as a real-world object, along with all physical constraints.

* StereoKit, by default, uses a flexible shader or material system with a built-in PBR.
