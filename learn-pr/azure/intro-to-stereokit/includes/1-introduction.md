Welcome to the StereoKit module! Here you'll learn some of the key features of StereoKit, how to set up StereoKit for Mixed Reality development, and also how to build Mixed Reality applications using StereoKit for different platforms.

StereoKit is a code-first library aimed primarily at engineers, and others who are working in code-first environments. This appeal to a large number of non-game C# developers. Visual Studio developers can continue operating as they have in the past, utilizing NuGet's vast functionality.

Suppose you want to build an application without using any game engine such as unity, and unreal. So in such a scenario, you can use StereoKit to develop your Mixed Reality applications.

StereoKit focuses on non-game Mixed Reality use cases, making it a better fit for people developing more traditional applications. In addition, it also focuses on Mixed Reality making it much easier to create high-quality Mixed Reality experiences. It performs Mixed Reality operations natively using basic core APIs while considering the limitations of StereoKit. It also helps you to overcome the complex game engine structures.

## StereoKit key features

* You can access StereoKit on platforms like HoloLens 2, Oculus Quest, Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Desktop, SteamVR, Varjo, Monado Linux, and eventually, everywhere OpenXR is.

* The StereoKit 3D model format must be in .gltf, .glb, .obj, .stl, ASCII.ply, and procedural.

* The StereoKit image or texture format must be in .jpg, .png, .tga, .bmp, .psd, .gif, .hdr, .pic, equirectangular cubemap, procedural.

* StereoKit builds your app to a device in a matter of seconds.

* StereoKit supports flat screen mode with input emulation, powerful UI, and interactions for easy development.

* Assets are loaded at runtime, allowing computations to proceed faster.

* Physics enables the 3D object to function as a real-world object, along with all physical constraints.

* StereoKit, by default, uses a flexible shader or material system with a built-in PBR.
