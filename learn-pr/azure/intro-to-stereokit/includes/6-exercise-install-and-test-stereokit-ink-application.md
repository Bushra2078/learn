In the previous chapter, you have learned how the StereoKit Ink application is developed and configured. In this chapter, you'll learn how to build and test the StereoKit Ink application on HoloLens 2 and Desktop.

> [!Important]
> Make sure you have installed **StereoKit's Visual Studio template**.

First, download the StereoKit Ink sample application from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maluoi/StereoKit-PaintTutorial/). Then click on the **Code** button & select **Download ZIP**. Once the file download is done, click on the folder & select the **StereoKitInk.sln** file. Then **solution file** will open in Visual Studio. On the right corner of the Visual Studio, you can find **Solution Explorer**, which contains the **assets folder** and three other **program files** such as the painting menu, palette menu, and main program, which operates the main logic.

> The program will contain errors, which will clear at a later time during debugging.

## Build StereoKit Ink application on HoloLens 2

1. To build StereoKit Ink application to HoloLens 2, configure Visual Studio for HoloLens 2 by selecting the **Release** configuration on the "Solution Platform," the **ARM64** architecture, and set **StereoKitPaintTutorial** as target:
  
   :::image type="content" source="../media/configuration-solution-platform.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows configuration of solution platform." lightbox="../media/configuration-solution-platform.png":::

2. Connect your HoloLens 2 to your computer, then in the menu bar, click on the **Debug** > **Start Debugging**.
Start Debugging automatically starts the application on your device with the Visual Studio debugger attached.

3. In the menu bar, click on the **Build** > **Deploy Solution** to deploy to your device without having the app start automatically.

## Build StereoKit Ink application on Desktop

1. To build StereoKit Ink application to Desktop, configure Visual Studio for Desktop by clicking on "Solution Configuration" to ensure the **Debug** and **Any CPU** is selected.
  
   :::image type="content" source="../media/change-solution-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows changing of Solution configuration." lightbox="../media/change-solution-configuration.png":::

2. Click on the Device dropdown and ensure the **StereoKitInk** is selected.
  
   :::image type="content" source="../media/ensure-project-setup-desktop.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows ensuring of project setup desktop is selected." lightbox="../media/ensure-project-setup-desktop.png":::

3. Then, click on the **Debug** > **Start Debugging** in the menu bar.
  Start Debugging automatically starts the application on your device with the Visual Studio debugger attached.
  
   :::image type="content" source="../media/select-start-debug.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows selecting of Start Debugging." lightbox="../media/select-start-debug.png":::

4. When the debugging is complete, the application will open on your desktop, and you'll be ready to draw.

## Test StereoKit Ink application

Once the solution is deployed, you can see the StereoKit Ink application window pop-up on your target device, such as HoloLens 2 or desktop. You can see a UI with three operable components. The components present on the screen are the painting menu, palette menu, handle, and operating hand.

You may start interacting with the application using the fingertip of your right hand. Choose a color of your choice from the available six colors and can customize these colors by altering the Hue, Saturation, and Value properties. You can modify the size of brushstrokes using the slider. You may move around your painting using the handle.

You can use UI buttons in the painting menu to make changes to the drawing if necessary. Undo option removes the most recent to the painting, while the Redo option removes the most recent undo from the stack. Save the drawing in the system's preferred location by clicking the save button. The Load button lets you select any .skp file, while the clear button clears the painting stroke. Finally, the Quit button allows you to close the StereoKit Ink application window.
