In this module, you've learned some of the key features of StereoKit and how to set up StereoKit for Mixed Reality development. With the help of the StereoKitInk sample application, you learned the basics of drawing and interacting with Mixed Reality content through various UI options.

This course provides you an understanding of developing the Mixed Reality application with StereoKit working across OpenXR platforms like HoloLens 2, Windows Mixed Reality, Monado Linux and so on.

## Next steps

The application you built using StereoKit can further be improvised by including few more functions or features provided by Microsoft. Consider trying the following:

* Consider including features such as pencil, brush, and airbrush tool.
* Incorporate the ability to add lines and shapes.
* Improvise by adding UI buttons to save the painting in image file format.
