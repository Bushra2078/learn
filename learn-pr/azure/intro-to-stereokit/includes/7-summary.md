In this module, you've learnt how to configure, set up and build an application using StereoKit.

This course provides you an understanding of developing the mixed reality application with StereoKit working across OpenXR platforms like HoloLens 2, Windows Mixed Reality, Monado Linux and so on.

## Next steps

The applications you build using StereoKit can further be improvised in the future or later, including few more functions or features provided by Microsoft. Consider trying the following:

* Consider including features such as pencil, brush and airbrush tool.
* Incorporate the ability to add lines and shapes.
* Improvise by adding UI buttons to save the painting in image file format.
