### Module scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a medium-size financial-services company with its headquarters in New York and a research facility in Dallas. It’s currently operating almost entirely on-premises, with the majority of its compute environment running on either Windows Server operating system or one of several Linux distributions. Its internal IT staff is well-versed in Microsoft technologies, including its virtualization and software-defined datacenter offerings.

In recent months, as part of datacenter consolidation and modernization initiatives, Contoso IT migrated some of its applications to a range of Azure IaaS and platform as a service (PaaS) services. However, a number of highly regulated workloads have to remain in the on-premises datacenters. 
Two of these workloads present a particular challenge due to their performance and resiliency requirements. The first of them is a group of heavily utilized Microsoft SQL Server instances hosting transactional databases for the Contoso's loan origination department. The second workload is an isolated Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) farm for users in Contoso's securities research department, which is supposed to replace an aging Windows Server 2012 R2–based Remote Desktop Services (RDS) deployment.

Contoso's Chief Information Officer (CIO) realizes that implementing these workloads will require additional investment in hardware. Before making the investment, she wants to verify that the extra expense will help the IT organization deliver a modern technological solution and accelerate the datacenter consolidation initiative. She also wants to make sure that it helps ensure a consistent management approach that leverages existing IT skills, and if possible, integrates with some of the cloud services that Contoso is already benefiting from, such as Azure Monitor. It's also critical that the new solution provide multiple levels of high availability and resiliency thereby protecting them from localized failures, and facilitate disaster recovery to another on-premises location.

IT management has started its search for solutions that would satisfy these requirements. Your role, as the lead system engineer, is to assist with the search and implement a proof-of-concept environment that would help identify the most viable candidate.

### Resolution of module problem

Using what you have learned, you determined that Azure Stack HCI would serve as the most suitable solution for Contoso. Contoso identified resource requirements for its workloads by reviewing performance utilization of the existing SQL Server deployments and estimating projected number and type of VDI users. That served as the basis for selecting properly sized hardware from the Azure Stack HCI Catalog. To validate the deployment, Contoso ran the functional and performance tests, leveraging Windows Admin Center and synthetic workloads generated by VM Fleet. To further optimize its deployment, Contoso integrated Azure Stack HCI clusters and their workloads with a number of cloud-based services that Contoso already implemented in its Azure subscriptions. In addition, Contoso is considering implementing a new disaster recovery solution based on Azure Site Recovery.
