  questions:

  - content: "Which event warrants running the Azure Stack HCI cluster validation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Adding a new server to an existing cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Cluster validation is warranted when adding a new server to an existing cluster."
    - content: "Replacing a failed drive in an existing cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Replacing a failed drive in an existing cluster. Replacement does not warrant running the wizard, but adding drives to the nodes of the existing cluster does."
    - content: "Adding a highly available VM to the cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Workload-related changes do not warrant running cluster validation."

  - content: "What tool can you use to validate cluster performance by using synthetic workloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "Validate-DCB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Validate-DCB tool validates the DCB configuration in clustering scenarios."
    - content: "Test-Cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Test-Cluster run the cluster validation."
    - content: "VM Fleet"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. VM Fleet provisions a distributed set of VMs to emulate a functional or performance impact of actual workloads against S2D infrastructure."
