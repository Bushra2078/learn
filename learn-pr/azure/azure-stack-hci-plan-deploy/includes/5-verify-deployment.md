Before deploying production workloads into an Azure Stack HCI cluster, you should confirm that its intended configuration is valid and meets the intended performance objectives. There are several validation steps that deliver complementing set of checks:

- Validation of cluster configuration by using Failover Clustering validation tools.
- Validation of DCB configuration of the cluster by using the Validate-DCB tool.
- Validation of cluster performance by using synthetic workloads.

The validation process should be also part of the cluster deployment process in the Contoso's proof-of-concept environment.

## Validation of cluster configuration by using Failover Clustering validation tools

The Windows Server Failover Clustering feature offers built-in functionality that provides the ability to run a set of tests on a collection of servers, networks, and associated storage that are either part of an existing cluster or are supposed to form a new one. The validation process tests the underlying hardware and software to assess whether the current configuration adheres to Microsoft support requirements. The test identifies all misconfigurations and generates a report containing a comprehensive summary of its findings.

Cluster validation is intended for the following scenarios:

- Preparing for deployment of production workloads into a newly installed cluster.
- Preparing for releasing workloads running on clustered guest VMs into production.
- Adding a new server to an existing cluster.
- Adding drives to the nodes of the existing cluster.
- Applying changes that affect cluster firmware or drivers.
- Restoring cluster configuration or its nodes from backup.
- Performing diagnostic tests on an existing cluster.

You can run cluster validation by using the:

- Validate Cluster option in Windows Admin Center.
- Validate a Configuration Wizard in Failover Cluster Manager.
- **Test-Cluster** Windows PowerShell cmdlet.

> [!CAUTION]
> Running the Validate Cluster option in Windows Admin Center requires that you enable Credential Security Service Provider (CredSSP) authentication for the duration of the validation process. You should disable it afterwards for security reasons. You can enable and disable CredSSP directly from Windows Admin Center.

## Validation of DCB configuration of the cluster by using the Validate-DCB tool

Deployment of Azure Stack HCI includes installation of Datacenter Bridging operating system feature to enforce or optimize SMB S2D traffic. Such installation is mandatory when using RoCE and optional, but recommended, when using iWARP. The Microsoft Validate-DCB tool validates the DCB configuration in clustering scenarios. It is available as a NuGet-based package that you can install simply by running the **Install-Module** PowerShell cmdlet from a computer with internet connectivity.

## Validation of cluster performance by using synthetic workloads

The most reliable performance validation approach relies on generating synthetic workloads that simulate the projected usage patterns, capturing relevant performance characteristics, and analyzing the captured data. To implement this approach on Azure Stack HCI, you should take advantage of the utilities that are part of the GitHub DISKSPD repo, including VM Fleet. VM Fleet provisions a distributed set of VMs to emulate a functional or performance impact of actual workloads against S2D infrastructure.
