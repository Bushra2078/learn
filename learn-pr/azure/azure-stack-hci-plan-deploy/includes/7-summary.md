In this module, you learned how to determine the optimal types of Azure Stack HCI workloads and plan for their implementation. Also you learned how to deploy Azure Stack HCI, verify its operational status and identify options for integrating it with Azure services.

Using this knowledge, you determined that Azure Stack HCI would serve as the most suitable solution for Contoso. Contoso identified resource requirements for its workloads by reviewing performance utilization of the existing SQL Server deployments and estimating projected number and type of VDI users. That served as the basis for selecting properly sized hardware from the Azure Stack HCI Catalog. To validate the deployment, Contoso ran the functional and performance tests, leveraging Windows Admin Center and synthetic workloads generated by VM Fleet. To further optimize its deployment, Contoso integrated Azure Stack HCI clusters and their workloads with a number of cloud-based services that Contoso already implemented in its Azure subscriptions.
