  - content: 'Contoso is creating its global connectivity subscription to support Azure services across six regions globally in the US, Europe, Australia, and India. Contoso will mostly be using PaaS services with Private Link but also about 500 virtual machines. Contoso has small colocation facilities and datacenters in 20 countries on every populated continent. Contoso currently uses multiple MPLS networks from three providers for datacenter and large office connectivity. Contoso requires firewalls for all traffic moving between on-premises and Azure, and it needs to minimize latency for these connections. Contoso will have many applications that need to communicate across Azure regions and cross-premises. Contoso also wants to minimize cost and complexity. Contoso should:'
    choices:
    - content: 'Implement a hub-and-spoke network, with Azure Firewall in the hubs and a hub in each of the six Azure regions.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This will work, but Azure Virtual WAN is preferred over a hub-and-spoke network unless the customer needs highly granular control of routing.'
    - content: 'Implement Virtual WAN with secured hubs (Azure Firewall) in each of the six Azure regions.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Virtual WAN is the preferred enterprise solution over a hub-and-spoke network, and Azure Firewall will meet the firewall requirement.'
    - content: 'Use only one very large virtual network in each region. Deploy Azure Firewall into that virtual network and all services for that region.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This will technically work but is too expensive and complex.'
    - content: 'Deploy Virtual WAN'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Virtual WAN is part of the solution but misses the firewall requirement.'

  - content: 'Contoso is creating its global connectivity subscription to support Azure services across six regions globally in the US, Europe, Australia, and India. Contoso will mostly be using PaaS services with Private Link but also about 3,000 virtual machines per region.

    - content: 'Implement a hub-and-spoke network, with Azure Firewall in the hubs and a hub in each of the six Azure regions.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'A hub-and-spoke network allows for more than 2,000 VMs per region, which is a current limitation of Virtual WAN.'
