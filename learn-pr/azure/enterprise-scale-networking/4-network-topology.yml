  questions:

  - content: "Contoso is deploying a network solution in Azure. They need to deploy a solution in a single Azure region, and they need to connect approximately 500 branch offices via VPN, as well as one main office via ExpressRoute. Contoso will deploy approximately 500 VMs across approximately 50 virtual networks. Azure Firewall must protect the following traffic: VNet to VNet, VNet to internet, branch to VNet and main office to VNet. Contoso also wants to minimize cost and complexity. Contoso should do which of the following?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Implement a hub and spoke network.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This doesn't meet the requiremens for firewall and branch office connectivity."
    - content: 'Implement Virtual Wan with Secured Hubs (Azure Firewall).'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Virtual WAN is the preferred solution because of the branch office connectivity needs and Secure Hub capability.'
    - content: 'Use only one very large virtual network. Deploy Azure Firewall into that virtual network and all services for that region.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This doesn't meet the branch office connectivity requirements."
    - content: 'Deploy Virtual WAN'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual WAN is part of the solution but doen't meet the firewall requirement."

  - content: ' Contoso is creating their global connectivity subscription to support Azure services across 6 regions globally in the US, Europe, Australia and India. Contoso will mostly be using PaaS services with Private Link but also about 3000 virtual machines per region. Contoso has small colocation facilities and datacenters in 20 different countries on every populated continent. Contoso currently uses multiple MPLS networks from 3 different providers to provide datacenter and large office connectivity. Contoso requires firewalls for all traffic moving between on premises and Azure and needs to minimize latency for these connections. Contoso will have many applications that need to communicate across Azure regions and cross premises. Contoso also wants to minimize cost and complexity. Contoso should?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Implement a hub and spoke network, with Azure Firewall in the hubs and a hub in each of the six Azure regions.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Hub and spoke allows for more than 2000 VMs per region which is a current limitation of Virtual WAN.'
    - content: 'Implement Virtual Wan with Secured Hubs (Azure Firewall) in each of the six Azure Regions.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Hub and spoke allows for more than 2000 VMs per region which is a current limitation of Virtual WAN.'
    - content: 'Use only one very large Virtual Network in each region. Deploy Azure Firewall into that vnet and all services for that region.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This will technically work, but is cost and complexity prohibitive.'
    - content: 'Deploy Virtual WAN.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual WAN could be part of the solution but doesn't meet the firewall requirement and has a limit of 2000 VMs per region."
