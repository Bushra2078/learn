Our goal was to use the `for` statement in our code, modifying how the `for` statement performs its looping logic.

Using the `for` statement, we iterated a hard-coded number of times, and used the `Length` on an array to iterate through the code block once for each item in the array.  We modified the iterator, the condition for exiting the loop, and the pattern for iteration.  We used the `break` keyword to exit out of the loop's body prematurely.

If you're following this learning path in order, we've now learned about the `foreach` and the `for` iteration statements.  Next, we'll use the `while` and `do-while` iteration statements to loop until a condition in the body of the code block is met.
