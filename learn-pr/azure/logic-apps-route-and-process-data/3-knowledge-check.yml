  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  
  - content: "Examine the illustration of the social-media workflow to answer this question. What would be the outcome of the workflow if a tweet was rated with a sentiment score of exactly 0.7?"
    choices:
    - content: "Send email"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The workflow sends an email anytime the sentiment is less-than-or-equal-to 0.7."
    - content: "Insert row"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The workflow inserts a row only when the sentiment score is greater than 0.7."
    - content: "Both send email and insert row"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The conditional *if action* runs a different branch based on whether the condition is true or false; it does not run both branches."

  - content: "Examine the illustration of the book-approval workflow to answer this question. Suppose a book publisher has a specific process for handling proposal submissions. Authors upload their proposals to Dropbox and are sent a confirmation text message. The editor receives an invitation to review and decide whether to approve, ask for a rework, or reject the proposal. Given the actions shown in the three branches of the *switch* statement, which order should the **Approve**, **Rework**, and **Reject** values appear in the *switch* statement?"
    choices:
    - content: "1. Rework 2. Approve 3. Reject"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It is sensible for **Rework** to leave the file in place, **Approve** to move the file to the *Approved* folder, and **Reject** to delete the file."
    - content: "1. Rework 2. Reject 3 Approve"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Rejected proposals should not be moved to the *Approved* folder."
    - content: "1. Approve 2. Reject 3. Rework"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Approved proposals should be moved to the *Approved* folder while rejected proposals should not."

  - content: "Examine the illustration of the email-attachment processing workflow to answer this question. How many blobs would be created from an email with six attachments?"
    choices:
    - content: "7"
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "One blob is created for the body of the email and one for each attachment. "
    - content: "6"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Six blobs are created for the six attachments. One blob is created for the email itself."
    - content: "8"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Six blobs are created for the six attachments. One blob is created for the email itself."
