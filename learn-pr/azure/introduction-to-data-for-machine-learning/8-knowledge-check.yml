  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Why do we clean our data before training?'
    choices:
    - content: "Removing rows of data makes our model more powerful"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Cleaning data helps us select features that will be helpful for the modelâ€™s performance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Removing rows that have errors prevents these from misleading the training process"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'What kind of data are best encoded with one-hot vectors?'
    choices:
    - content: "Ordinal data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Categorical data with two possible values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This kind of data can simply be encoded in a single column as a 0 and a 1."
    - content: "Categorical data with three or more values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'What is a data sample? What is a population?'
    choices:
    - content: "A sample is all possible data we care about. A population is the subset of that data which we actually have on hand"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Both population and sample mean data we train our model with."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "A population is all possible data we care about. A sample is the subset of that data which we actually have on hand."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'You have a model that isn't performing well. Which of these will definitely **not** help improve its performance?'
    choices:
    - content: "Adding additional samples (rows)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Adding rows of data is likely to help your dataset be more representative, and so help your model train."
    - content: "Adding a small number of features (columns) that you know are related to what the model is trying to predict"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. So long as you have enough rows of data, adding relevant features is likely to help your model train."
    - content: "Adding a large number of features that you know aren't related to what the model is trying to predict."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Adding additional features that aren't relevant will probably harm its performance"
