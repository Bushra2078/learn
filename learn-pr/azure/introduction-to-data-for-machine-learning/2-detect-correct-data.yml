  title: Hi Jason! Can we put a knowledge check here?
  questions:
  - content: "Do we want a knowledge check here?"
    choices:
    - content: "Straight or curved, whichever best fits the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Linear regression finds the best straight line that fits the data. It does not check if a curved line is a better fit."
    - content: "Straight."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Linear regression tries to find the optimal angle and position for a straight line."
    - content: "Curved."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Linear regression finds the best linear line that fits the data."
    - content: "Jagged."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Linear regression finds a regular line that fits the data."
  - content: "A line that fits well will have a:"
    choices:
    - content: "Small error."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the error is small, this means that the predicted values are close to the data points."
    - content: "Large error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the error is large, this means that the predicted values do not match the data well."
    - content: "Unknown error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The error must be known to know how well the line fits the data."
    - content: "Negative error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The error can not be negative."
