Guidance

There will be two separate exercise units. First fine tuning , 2nd learning. They're one after another here, separate for proper PR.

# 1st Exercise/practice - fine tuning

## View the subnets detected by your sensor

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored>

## Modify subnet data to match your network

## View detected devices

## Update selected details

Note: For exercise - Prepare your environment â€“ Create a sensor with sample data. Speak to Vishakha about how we can use the hands on lab. We might still have to instruct them on how to set up a VM to deploy this. (this basically skips the install/activate steps)

# 2nd Exercise - Learning

## View your alerts

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/how-to-view-alerts>

## Select a few to triage and learn to add them to your learned network baseline

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/how-to-view-alerts#prerequisites>

## triage

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/how-to-view-alerts#manage-alert-status-and-triage-alerts>

# knowledge check

## Baseline of OT network traffic for sensors created

Knowledge check (apply level): To do  

## Explain the differences between different alert status options

Questions about managing alerts in hybrid â€“ both on prem and in the Azure portal

Apply level questions for these key takeaways?

<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: remind the learner of the core idea(s) from the preceding learning-content unit (without mentioning the details of the exercise or the scenario)

    Heading: none

    Example: "A storage account represents a collection of settings that implement a business policy."
