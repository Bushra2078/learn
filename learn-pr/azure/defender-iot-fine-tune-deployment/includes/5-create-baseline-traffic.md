Should there be 2 units here or do we need to add an extra unit? 1 - describe, 2nd plan?
## Describe the baseline process

Your sensor is now fine tuned and almost fully operational. The final stage is to create a baseline of alerts so that Microsoft Defender for IoT understands the normal type of traffic flow through your system. This way Defender for IoT is able to identify which traffic is most dangerous or suspicious and produces accurate alerts. This *learning* process can take several weeks as you redefine any incorrect alerts that Defender for IoT has flagged.

Once the learning process is complete, Defender for IoT will have created an accurate baseline of alerts to work from and protect your devices. It is still possible that you will have to add new alerts but this will not occcur on such a regular basis as in this initial period.

## OT sensor learning mode

The following diagram shows the complete OT deployment path, with the team responsible for each phase:

This module describes the sixth and final phase in the deployment: *Baseline learning ends*. In a real-life scenario, the deployment and connectivity teams ensure that the sensor is already activated, sending data to Defender for IoT, and is fine-tuned.

The sensor baseline learning is the phase where Defender for IoT identifies suscpicious or harmful traffic and creates a list of alerts for each of them. When this traffic is identified in the future, alerts are sent to Defender for IoT, and you are able to contain and protect your devices. You must monitor these alerts and in some cases adjust them to be more accurate. This process can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the complexity and size of your network.

## In this phase

### Triage alerts

Once the sensor is set up and sends data, Defender for IoT starts to idenify normal and irregular traffic flow within the network. This state is called the learning mode, where Defender for IoT identifies regular activity, such as regular file transfers or data flows between devices. This regular activity is logged and will not trigger an alert in the future. Any traffic in the network that does not match these will trigger an alert.

The new alerts that are sent to Defender for IoT must be checked and in some cases you will need to adjust their status. This way Defender for IoT learns which alerts are real cases of harmful traffic and which are unsuspicious and can be added to the baseline. The learning process can take several weeks to complete.

### End the learning mode

The learning mode will turn off when the sensor detects a decrease in the number of new alerts produced, which is typically 2-6 weeks after deployment. You can also turn off the learning mode manually when you feel that the alerts accurately reflect your network activity.

As new alerts are detected in the future, they can be set, individually, to learning mode, and then included in a new baseline once the sensor correctly identifies them. This ensures that your baseline of alerts is up to date, doesn't miss new types of suspicious traffic and keeps your network and devices safe.

# Plan the baseline

In Defender for IoT, select the Alerts page. This lists all of the alerts generated by the sensor. There are 4 severities of alerts that are assigned by the sensor, which can be modified, they are: *Critical, Major, Minor, Warning*. Alerts also have a status of *New, Active, Closed*.

In the list of alerts, select either a specific alert or a group of alerts, and the details will appear in the alert pane which includes the alert description, traffic source and destination and more.

Alerts can either be analyzed in a map view of the event timeline view.

The Map View shows the source and destination devices for an alert as well as other devices connected to your sensor (check this out, is the source a device or sensor??). For example:

<!-- add image here of map view -->

THe Event Timeline shows the alert event together in a list, with other recent activity. ( How is this useful? What do I learn from seeing the other events?). For example:

<!-- add image here of event timeline view-->
