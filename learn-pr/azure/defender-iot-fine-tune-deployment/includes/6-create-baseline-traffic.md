Your car manufacturing organization has offices and production sites across the globe, with a network linking them together. A sensor was onboarded to Defender for IoT and deployed to the sensor. Now your task is to set up the alert baseline to ensure that alerts ignore normal traffic with in the system and only report on suspicious activity.

## Triage your alerts

In Defender for IoT, select the Alerts page that lists all of the alerts generated by the sensor. To triage the alerts, you need to analyze the **severity** and **status** settings automatically assigned to it. There are four severities of alerts that the sensor assigns, which can be modified. They are: *Critical, Major, Minor, Warning*. Alerts also have a status of *New, Active, Closed*. We recommend that you start triaging the critical level alerts first. <!-- check the differences between sensor and Azure only 3 severity levels on Azure, but 4 on sensor? How does that work?  I have added this later but should any of this be mentioned here instead?-->

### Filter and group alerts

Filter the list of alerts by a parameter or mix of parameters. <!--The list of alerts can be filtered by any parameter or mix of parameters you want to apply.--> The list can also be sorted using **Group by** as well.  

From the list of alerts, select a specific alert and the details appear in the alert pane, including the alert description, traffic source and destination and more. Choosing multiple alerts allows you to make bulk changes to the status, severity or learn levels using the top menu bar<!-- does this have another name? -->.

### Analyze an alert

An Alert can be analyzed in greater depth in the Alert detail page, which shows the alert details and suggests remediation steps to take. You can also download the PCAP files of the raw data for the alert, and analyze them using a PCAP file reader, which might also give you more information about the alert.
<!--This is in the OT sensor only: do we keep this or not?
either be analyzed in a map view or the event timeline view.

The Map View shows the source and destination devices for an alert as well as other devices connected to your sensor. For example:

The Event Timeline View shows the alert event together in a list with other recent activity that occurred on the device before and after the alert was detected. This gives you a better insight into what was happening on the network before and after this alert occurred. Seeing the list of events might help you identify the cause of the alert, or understand that there is nothing problematic in this case. For example:

### Update alerts

After analyzing the alert details, you can update its severity or status levels. Alerts can have four different statuses in the Azure portal.
<!-- Do we go over ther rules first or the alerts?? - I think , it is alerts only, as this is referring to the initial set up. How much of the alert status table should be included here? Only the info relevant to the Azure portal. -->

|Status / triage action   |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**New**     |     *New* alerts are alerts that haven't yet been triaged or investigated by the team. New traffic detected for the same devices doesn't generate a new alert, but is added to the existing alert.   |
|**Active**     |     Set an alert to *Active* to indicate that an investigation is underway, but that the alert can't yet be closed or otherwise triaged. <br><br>This status has no effect elsewhere in Defender for IoT.      |
|**Closed**     | Close an alert to indicate that the investigation is complete, and you want to be alerted again the next time the same traffic is detected.<br><br>Closing an alert adds it to the sensor event timeline.  |
|**Learn**     |    Learn an alert when you want to close it and add it as allowed traffic, so that you aren't alerted again the next time the same traffic is detected. <br><br>For example, when the sensor detects firmware version changes following standard maintenance procedures, or when a new, expected device is added to the network. <br><br>Learning an alert closes the alert and adds an item to the sensor event timeline. Detected traffic is included in data mining reports, but not when calculating other OT sensor reports. <br><br>Learning alerts is available for selected alerts only, mostly those triggered by *Policy* and *Anomaly* engine alerts. |

Defender for IoT alerts use the following severity levels:

| Azure portal  | OT sensor  | Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **High**     | **Critical**        | Indicates a malicious attack that should be handled immediately.        |
| **Medium**     | **Major**        | Indicates a security threat that's important to address.        |
| **Low**     | **Minor**, **Warning**        | Indicates some deviation from the baseline behavior that might contain a security threat, or contains no security threats.        |

Alert severities on this page are listed by the severity as shown in the Azure portal.

<!-- what to do with this, it is not available on D4IoT portal? Maybe write this: Note: In the sensor portal, you can also set the alert status to Mute. But this is not available in the Azure portal. 
|**Mute**     |  - OT network sensors <br><br>- On-premises management console      <br><br>*Unmuting* an alert is available only on the OT sensor.  |  Mute an alert when you want to close it and not see again for the same traffic, but without adding the alert allowed traffic. <br><br>For example, when the Operational engine triggers an alert indicating that the PLC Mode was changed on a device. The new mode might indicate that the PLC isn't secure, but after investigation, it's determined that the new mode is acceptable. <br><br>Muting an alert closes it, but doesn't add an item to the sensor event timeline. Detected traffic is included in data mining reports, but not when calculating data for other sensor reports. <br><br>Muting an alert is available for selected alerts only, mostly those triggered by the *Anomaly*, *Protocol Violation*, or *Operational* engines.  |-->

Changes are saved and the baseline alerts are updated accordingly. As this process continues, you'll notice a decrease in the number of new alerts as the sensor learns the normal flow of traffic in your system.

Eventually, the sensor will automatically change from Learning mode to Operational mode when it detects a low level of new alerts. Alternatively, if you think the sensor is properly set up you can manually change to Operational mode. After this you could still receive new alerts, and must check and triage them as well. Some need to be assigned as Learn and even though the sensor isn't in the Learning mode, new alerts can be added to the baseline to keep the sensor up to date of new threats to your system.

<!-- A nice definition. may use it more.
Baseline - creates an environmental baseline for the normal communication behaviour of devices in your network is known. going forward, anything that is unseen traffic will create an alert to be followed up with.

<!-- from videos i have watched, they make a report first and then use that to go through alerts, but in our documentation it just goes through alerts which should be triaged. So just wondering about that difference!! Ask Theo when he is in touch today . I will write based on the internal documentation, not MSFT videos, etc. -->
