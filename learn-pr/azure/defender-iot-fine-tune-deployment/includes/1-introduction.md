Microsoft Defender for IoT provides comprehensive threat detection for IoT/OT networks, with multiple deployment options that include cloud-connected, fully on-premises, or hybrid environments.

This module describes the steps required to fine-tune and calibrate a cloud-connected sensor to Defender for IoT for operational technology (OT) monitoring.


## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a car manufacturer that has offices and production sites across the globe. You're tasked with implementing a system to monitor traffic and secure your manufacturing automation systems (Operational Technology), from the access panels to the pneumatic and packaging systems. To take your organizations's OT security visibility to a whole new level, your team chooses to use Microsoft Defender for IoT.

You have an OT sensor onboarded, installed, and activated. Data is now being mirrored to the sensor. You’ll now need to check and fine-tune your sensor settings to ensure that your sensor detects the traffic that you want to monitor and alerts you correctly for risky activity. When your sensor has a learned baseline of network traffic, you’re ready to switch out of learning mode into operation mode.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll:

- Fine-tune the defined subnets by reviewing the subnets detected by your sensor and updating subnet data to match your network
- Fine-tune the devices by reviewing the detected devices and updating details for selected device
- Create a baseline of OT network traffic by triaging alerts and adding them to your network baseline.

## What is the main goal?
By the end of this session, you'll be able to fine tune and calibrate your an OT sensor to complete your deployment of Defender for IoT.
