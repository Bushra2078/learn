Guidance

There will be two separate exercise units. First fine tuning , 2nd learning. They're one after another here, separate for proper PR.

# 1st Exercise/practice - fine tuning

## View the subnets detected by your sensor

<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored>

## Modify subnet data to match your network

## View detected devices

## Update selected details

Note: For exercise - Prepare your environment â€“ Create a sensor with sample data. Speak to Vishakha about how we can use the hands on lab. We might still have to instruct them on how to set up a VM to deploy this. (this basically skips the install/activate steps)
