You triaged the alerts and determined that the alerts produced accurately represent the network activity. And you think the level of alerts has droped to an acceptable level. Instead of waiting for Defender for IoT to automatically switch from *learning* mode to *operational* mode, you want to manually turn off *learning* mode.

## Manually end learning mode

To manually change the sensor from learning mode to operational mode, complete the following steps.

1. In the Sensor, select **System settings**.
1. Select **Detection Engines and Network Modeling**.
1. Under **Network modeling**, toggle the **Learning** button to **Enabled**.
1. Select **Close**.

## Check your work

Review the **System settings**. It should show that *learning* mode is enabled.

Once the operational mode is enabled your deployment of the OT sensor to Defender for IoT is complete.
