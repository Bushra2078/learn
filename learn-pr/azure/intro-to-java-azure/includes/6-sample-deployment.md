In this unit, you'll configure a Spring Boot application to be deployed via Maven and then create and deploy to an Azure App Service instance.

## Sample application

You can go with an example, you've created by yourself. Or you succeed with a common Spring Boot example that can be found at the spring starters.

Clone in your favorite command-line tool.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
```

And then run it locally.

``` bash
cd spring-petclinic

./mvnw package

java -jar target/*.jar
```

Opening in the browser, it should like this.

## Prepare the sample application to be cloud ready

In the src folder you'll find Object, Controller, and Repository classes.

As Java is platform independent, the OS is free to be chosen. But what's important for the deployment is the Java version. You find the version in the `pom.xml`.

```xml
<properties>
    <java.version>1.8</java.version>
</properties>
```

Your example is using Java 8. So our App Service, Linux or Windows should use Java 8 as well. As the platform doesn't matter, we'll use Linux for our example.

We have to add some Azure dependencies to the `pom.xml` file. This adding can be done automatically for us by running

```bash
mvn com.microsoft.azure:azure-webapp-maven-plugin:1.12.0:config
```

Running that command will ask for some options to be specified. Those options will be stored automatically in our `pom.xml`.

```bash
Please choose which part to config:
* 1: Application
  2: Runtime
  3: DeploymentSlot
Enter your choice: 1
Define value for appName [spring-petclinic-XXXX200]:
Define value for resourceGroup [spring-petclinic-XXXX200-rg]:
Define value for region [westeurope]:
Define value for pricingTier(P1v2):
   1: b1
   2: b2
   3: b3
   4: d1
   5: f1
*  6: p1v2
   7: p2v2
   8: p3v2
   9: s1
  10: s2
  11: s3
Enter your choice: 1
Please confirm webapp properties
AppName : spring-petclinic-XXXX200
ResourceGroup : spring-petclinic-XXXX200-rg

```

As you can see, you can go with the defaults for a simple deployment.

The `pom.xml` file has now added the required plugin for the automatically maven-based deployment to Azure.

```xml
 <plugin>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>  
        <artifactId>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>  
        <version>1.12.0</version>  
        <configuration>
          <schemaVersion>V2</schemaVersion>  
          <subscriptionId>XXX-XXX-XXX</subscriptionId>  
          <resourceGroup>spring-petclinic-XXX200-rg</resourceGroup>  
          <appName>spring-petclinic-XXX200</appName>  
          <pricingTier>B2</pricingTier>  
          <region>westeurope</region>  
          <runtime>
            <os>linux</os>  
            <javaVersion>jre8</javaVersion>  
            <webContainer>jre8</webContainer>
          </runtime>  
          <deployment>
            <resources>
              <resource>
                <directory>${project.basedir}/target</directory>  
                <includes>
                  <include>*.jar</include>
                </includes>
              </resource>
            </resources>
          </deployment>
        </configuration>
  </plugin>
```

## Deploy the application with maven

Great! We're already prepared for the deployment to Azure App Service.

```bash
mvn package com.microsoft.azure:azure-webapp-maven-plugin:1.12.0:deploy
```

This command will run the tests, and automatically spin up an Azure App Service and deploy the packaged application.

Congratulations! The app is successfully deployed to Azure App Service.
