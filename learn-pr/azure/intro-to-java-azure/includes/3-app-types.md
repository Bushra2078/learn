In this unit, we'll distinguish between the different types of server-side Java application that will help you to choose a matching cloud solution.

## Monolithic applications

A monolithic application is  an *All in One* solution that still fits for many projects. A Monolithic application is a good start for prototyping and startups. It's simple to develop, easy to debug and to test, and simple to deploy. They bring little cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, or monitoring.

Traditionally your monolithic applications run on application servers and scale the entire application as a whole.

## Microservices

Today businesses are asked to adapt and fail fast and expect the unexpected to succeed. To achieve a reduced time to market, more engineers get hired. But the outcome might be the opposite! It results in a higher time to market as you do have more communication effort when more engineers need to collaborate. The solution here is to divide and conquer.

In a Cross-functional team, you can deliver features as independently as possible. Each team should be responsible for their own dedicated part of their software.

## Batch

Some applications are intended to run briefly. They execute a particular workload, and then exit rather than wait for requests or user input. Batch Jobs are a solution for this use-case. Even though some batches can last for hours. Sometimes jobs need to run once or at regular, scheduled intervals. On premises, such jobs are often invoked from a server's crontab.

## Serverless

Functions are only executed on an event. A function is "triggered" by a specific type of event. Supported triggers include responding to changes in data, responding to messages, running on a schedule, or as the result of an HTTP request.
