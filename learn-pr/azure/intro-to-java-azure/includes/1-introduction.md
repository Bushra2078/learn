Java is the most used development language, and not only among enterprises. For almost two decades, it has been in the top five of the popular languages according to Stack Overflow and GitHub. And during the last five years, Java was solidly in the top three. It's no wonder. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) offers a mature and technology-agnostic way to run Java applications efficiently.

Azure offers various ways to deploy your Java applications. No matter what types of Java applications you're running, Azure has a solution. That includes batch processes, nanoservices, and microservices, all the way up to Java EE and Jakarta EE applications.

In this module, we demonstrate Java's importance. Then we discuss its various appearances and give an overview of typical deployment offers for your Java solutions on Azure.
