  questions:
  - content: "Where can I deploy my Maven packaged Spring Boot application?"
    choices:
    - content: "App Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can easily deploy the Maven or Gradle packaged Spring Boot application. But it might not be the only solution that Azure provides for you."
    - content: "VM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even though it's possible to deploy the packaged Spring Boot Application on a VM in Azure, it's not the preferred way to do so. Azure provides more support with other services."
    - content: "Spring Cloud"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Spring Cloud is the home of distributed Spring Boot services."
    - content: "All the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Whether you're at the beginning of a _lift and shift_ migration toward the cloud or you start cloud native, Azure provides various services that you can choose from."
  - content: "Maven helps to automatically deploy the application to Azure App Service."
    choices:
    - content: "No. You must go through the portal to deploy an application to Azure App Service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even though you can easily deploy the Maven or Gradle packaged application via the Azure portal, it might not be the only solution that Azure provides for you."
    - content: "Yes. Maven can not only package the application, but also add the required plug-in and run the deployment to Azure App Service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The statement is correct. Maven is a powerful tool. So is Gradle."
  - content: "What types of Java applications can be deployed on Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Desktop applications"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Desktop applications do have to run on the client side. You can spin up a VM on Azure to do so. But didn't you miss something?"
    - content: "Microservices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microservices are cloud-native applications. But didn't you miss something?"
    - content: "Monolithic applications"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Monolithic applications might be able to lift and shift toward Azure."
    - content: "All the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Even though it depends on the specific application, Azure does offer services for all of these applications."
