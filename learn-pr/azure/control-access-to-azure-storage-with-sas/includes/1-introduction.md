When you store files and data in Azure, you need to grant access to them securely. Azure Storage accounts provide ways to grant secure access by using shared access signature (SAS).

You work for a healthcare organization and are developing an application that stores patient diagnostic images in blob storage. These images are highly sensitive, and you need to ensure that your application accesses them securely. You'll update your application to integrate with other providers and give authorization to the images by using SAS.

In this module, you'll explore the options available to authorize access to your Azure storage. The focus in the module is on SAS and its different variants. You'll deploy a web app that uses a storage account and enhance it to use SAS.

After you finish this module, you'll have a running web app that uses SAS associated with a stored access policy. You'll see how your patients' images are only accessible by using a SAS. Then you'll revoke access by updating the stored access policy.
