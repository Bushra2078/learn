  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your organization has an internal system to share patient appointment information and notes. You can secure the access based on a user's membership in an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group. Which kind of authorization supports this scenario best, and why?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a shared access signature (SAS) token. You use the Azure AD credentials and a user delegation SAS token."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option is the most secure way to use SAS, but in this case the best option is to authenticate by using an Azure service principal."
    - content: "Use Azure Active Directory. By using Azure AD, you can create a service principal to authenticate the app."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This option is the best because no code or configuration files need to store credentials. Access is controlled with Azure AD and can be extended or revoked without requiring any code changes."
    - content: "Use a shared key. The Azure Storage account can create and revoke keys that will be used in your app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option isn't correct and involves your app needing to keep an up-to-date key in code or configuration files. It also grants root-like level access to the storage account."
  - content: "Your public-facing static website stores all its public UI images in blob storage. The website needs to display the graphics without any kind of authorization. Which is the best option?"
    choices:
    - content: "Public access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This option requires the least effort to implement. There are no credentials that need to be stored or managed. For this website, it's the best option."
    - content: "Shared key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option isn't a good solution in this scenario. Only read-only access is required. Using a shared key gives root-like access to the storage."
    - content: "Shared access signature"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The flexibility and security of using a shared access signature aren't required in this scenario. Public access is the best option."
