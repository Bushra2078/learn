Our goal was to help you to determine:

- Whether Project Bonsai is suitable for your organization. 
- How Bonsai can help accelerate AI-powered automation development.

To help with your decision, you used the following criteria:

- Is there value in optimizing any of your automation systems?
- Do you have AI experts in your organization to optimize those systems?
- Can you use an existing (or build a new) simulation of your automation systems?

You applied these criteria to a fictional soap manufacturing company. You should now be able to determine whether Project Bonsai can help accelerate AI-powered automation development.
