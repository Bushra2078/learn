In this unit, you'll learn how to determine whether Project Bonsai is a good fit
for your AI-powered control problem. The criteria to consider are:

- Business value
- Available expertise
- Simulation overhead

## Decision criteria

| Criteria                                                     | Analysis                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Is there value in optimizing your automation systems?        | This question is crucial. Many organizations estimate a 2 percent to 5 percent increase in a key performance indicator (KPI) or increases in revenue or cost savings of roughly 1 million USD, following optimization. |
| Do you have AI experts?                                      | Do you have AI experts? Will you have access to the experts who have previously controlled the system? These experts can provide valuable insights during your optimization project. Most of the system is built on learning from those experts and then building even more optimization on top of that experience. |
| Can you build a simulation system or do you already have one? | If you determine there's value in optimizing the system, you must determine if there's already a simulated environment. If not, do you have the skills to create one? |

## Apply the criteria

Consider using Project Bonsai when you meet the following criteria:

- There's value in optimizing your automation systems.
- You have a simulation of your automation systems or you're able to build one.

It's also ideal, but not essential, that you have AI experts in your organization who have experience optimizing your automation systems.

### Example of when to use

Let's consider our earlier example of making soap. Manufacturing soap is complex and many variables affect it, including:

- The chemical process, which can be hard to control.
- Predicting the behavior of the machinery (an extruder) can be difficult.

Because of these challenges, it can be hard to optimize the system. Bonsai brains would provide this organization with improved control over their automation systems. The organization's engineers want a brain that:

- Automatically signals their advanced process-control system.
- Adapts quickly to production changeovers.
- Applies short-term process changes when the extruder becomes coated with soap over multiple runs.
- Applies long-term process changes as extruder equipment wears.

Bonsai will enable them to achieve their goals.
