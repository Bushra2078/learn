In this unit, you'll evaluate whether Project Bonsai can help you build machine teaching simulations. You'll decide whether Bonsai can help you to more quickly and easily implement AI-powered automation development. The criteria you'll consider are: 

- Is there value in optimizing any of your automation systems?
- Do you have AI experts in your organization to optimize those systems?
- Can you use an existing (or build a new) simulation of your automation systems?

## Decision criteria

| Criteria                                                     | Analysis                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Is there value in optimizing your automation systems?        | This is the crucial question. Many organizations estimate a two to five percent increase in a key performance indicator (KPI), or increases in revenue or cost savings of roughly $1 million, following optimization. |
| Do you have AI experts?                                      | Do you have AI experts, and will you have  access to those experts, who have controlled the system in the past? These experts can provide valuable insights during the optimization project. The vast majority of the system is built on learning from these experts and then building even more optimization on top of that experience. |
| Can you build a simulation system, or do you already have one? | After you determine there is value in optimizing the system, then you must determine if there is already a simulated environment. If not, do you have the skills to create one? |


## Apply the criteria

Consider using Project Bonsai when you meet the following criteria:

- There is value in optimizing your automation systems
- You have a simulation of your automation systems, or you are able to build one

It's also ideal, but not essential that: 

- You have AI experts in your organization that have experience optimizing your automation systems

### Example of when to use

Going back to our earlier example, and making soap. Manufacturing soap is complex, and affected by many variables:

- The chemical process can be hard to control
- Predicting the behavior of the machinery (an extruder) can be difficult. 

Because of these challenges, it can be hard to optimize the system. Bonsai brains would provide this organization with improved control over their automation systems. The organization's engineers want a brain that: 

- Automatically signals their APC system.
- Adapts quickly to production changeovers.
- Applies short-term process changes when the extruder becomes coated with soap over multiple runs.
- Applies long-term process changes as extruder equipment wears.

Bonsai will enable them to achieve their goals.
