    Example: "Here, we'll discuss how Logic Apps works behind the scenes. You'll learn about all the pieces of Logic apps and see how they fit together into an app. This knowledge will help you decide whether Logic Apps will work for you without any customization. In cases where you do need to create custom components, you'll be able to determine how difficult it will be.
        * Connectors, triggers, actions
        * Control actions

In this unit, you'll learn how the Project Bonsai components work together. If you're a user of automation systems, you'll learn how Bonsai can streamline the process of automation development. As we've discussed, Bonsai consists of the components described in the following table, and displayed in the graphic.

| Component                                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Simulation connector                       | Connects a simulator to Bonsai.                              |
| AI training engine                         | Manages AI learning.                                         |
| Training curriculum (goals and objectives) | Defines what the AI should learn using user-friendly terms.  |
| Brain exporter                             | Packages the trained AI in a container for deployment in production. |
| Inkling                                    | A customer programming language.                             |

## How do these components work together?

In a typical scenario, you might identify a problem you want to solve using AI. You then:

1. Create a simulation that models your real-world environment in which the AI can operate. 
2. Next, you  test and verify the simulation locally.
3. You then use a connector to import the simulation as a managed simulation package in Bonsai. 

Similarly, after you've identified the problem set, you:

1. Design a teaching plan in Inkling using goals and objectives.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The teaching plan structures the learning process for the Bonsai brain. 

2. You then perform an iterative process of training and assessing the performance of the Bonsai brain.
3. When you feel the brain is trained appropriately, you export the now fully trained AI as a Docker container.
4. You run verification against the AI locally. 
5. When you're satisfied with the AI performance, you can deploy the container and integrate it with your real-world control system.

## Work with simulations

As you've learned, simulations replicate your real-world systems. This enables you to provide a valid training context in which your Bonsai brains can learn. When planning your simulations, consider that simulations that work well with Bonsai have the following characteristics:

- A suitable level of fidelity. This ensures that strategies you develop against the simulation are likely to work well in the real world.
- Useful visualization and data output. This helps ensure meaningful real-time assessment during training.
- A well-defined environment state. This must be accessible at each step of the simulation.
- A customizable start state. This helps ensure that the brain learns from a variety of conditions.
- A set of discrete actions the brain can take to affect the state. For example: 

   - Move a cart one step on a production line
   - Adjust a temperature in a manufacturing process by 1Â° Celsius

- The ability to identify system failure. For example, when the system gets into a state where further progress is impossible. For example: 

   - A cart stops on the production line
   - The temperature exceeds a manufacturing threshold

- The ability to determine when the system reaches a success state. For example: 

   - A cart moves down the line over a defined distance
   - The temperature is maintained at a constant value for a defined period

When considering your simulation approach, it may be helpful to look for people in your organization that have worked with simulation software before. 

> [!TIP]
> You can often repurpose simulations originally created for other purposes, and enhance them to work with the Bonsai training engine. 

Try to locate  simulations with the following characteristics:

- Used to train human operators.
- Used in conjunction with production systems.
- Well-defined benchmarks for accuracy and desired outcomes.


## Work with the training engine

As discussed, the training engine manages AI learning, and consists of the following four components:

- Architect
- Instructor
- Learner
- Predictor

### Architect

Based on the training curriculum that you define using Inkling code, the Architect: 

- Creates and optimizes learning topologies (neural networks). 
- Proposes the configuration of learning algorithms and topologies that have the best chance at learning the concepts in the model.

> [!TIP]
> Essentially, the Architect does what a data scientist would do when evaluating the effectiveness of a neural network.

The Architect supports the following learning algorithms:

- Distributed Deep Q Network (APEX)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Soft Actor Critic (SAC)

> [!NOTE]
> The set of heuristics used by the Architect is based on the heuristics used by the data science and machine learning experts that work on the Architect codebase.

### Instructor

Based on the needs of the training curriculum, the Instructor: 

- Carries out the training plan by configuring:

   - The Learner 
   - Any required data sources

- Works interactively, and responds in real time as the Learner iterates through the process of:

   - Receiving data
   - Computing a response
   - Being assessed
   - Learning from the result

### Learner

The Learner carries out the underlying AI algorithms selected by the Architect. During training, the Learner coordinates with the Instructor to set the starting parameters of the learning algorithm then determines a response and grades its performance.

In a deployed Brain, the Learner is responsible for instantiating the trained system and executing its computation when needed.

### Predictor

The Predictor is essentially a trained brain. After the brain is trained, Bonsai hosted the AI algorithm in prediction mode. 

> [!NOTE]
> Prediction mode holds a brain for use as an HTTP API endpoint. This enables programmers to send input data to the brain to get back a prediction.

## Work with the training curriculum

The training engine uses your training curriculum (your goals) to:

- Select the best learning algorithm for your brain 
- Report on training progress based on the goals you specified

Available goal objectives include:

- Avoid. Avoid a defined region.
- Drive. Get to a target as quickly as possible and stay near the target.
- Maximize. Push a target value as high as possible within a given range.
- Minimize. Push a target value as low as possible within a given range.
- Reach. Get to a target as quickly as possible.

> [!TIP]
> You can define any number of goals and the training engine attempts to satisfy them all.
