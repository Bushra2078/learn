Microsoft Project Bonsai is a low-code AI platform. Accelerate development for
control systems that provide operator guidance or make independent decisions.

Build AI-powered control systems to:

- Optimize process variables.
- Improve production efficiency.
- Help reduce downtime.

To help you understand how Bonsai works, we will start by covering the underlying
logical elements, which are displayed in the following image:

- Training simulator
- Training engine
- Training curriculum
- Integrated simulator
- Trained AI, also known as a Bonsai brain

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a soap manufacturing company. The company uses an extrusion
process to produce the soap and an advanced process control (APC) system to
manage production.

The Engineers that oversee the APC system think that making changes to the
manufacturing process could improve production yield. To make the changes, the
Engineers send new commands to the APC system to control manufacturing. The APC
system then adjusts the manufacturing equipment accordingly.

Because of the complexity of the soap manufacturing process, it can be difficult
to control, and therefore optimize, production. Some of the variables include:

- Adjustments in the parts of the manufacturing equipment. 
- Variations in raw materials.
- Wear and tear on the machinery.
- Residue from previous production runs. 

The soap company can benefit from using Project Bonsai because a Bonsai brain
would be able to:

- Automatically signal the APC system.
- Adapt quickly to production changeovers.
- Apply short-term process changes due to residue in the extruder.
- Apply long-term process changes due to equipment wear and tear.
- Advise operators to make adjustments instead of controlling the extruder
  directly.

## What will we be doing?

You'll assess the capabilities of Project Bonsai to develop and deploy AI-powered control systems. To do this, you'll:

- Identify the key features and components of Bonsai.
- Describe the function of these components.
- Determine whether Bonsai is a good fit for your organization.


## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to determine whether Bonsai is suitable for your organization. You'll also be able to describe how Bonsai can help accelerate AI-powered automation development.
