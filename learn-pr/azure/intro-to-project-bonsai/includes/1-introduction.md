Microsoft Project Bonsai is a low-code AI platform. It helps accelerate AI-powered automation development. You can use Bonsai to build AI components that can:

- Optimize process variables
- Improve production efficiency
- Help reduce downtime

You can use Bonsai to either:

- Provide operator guidance 
- Make independent decisions 

Bonsai provides an intuitive interface that lets you create AI. Bonsai consists of a number of logical elements, displayed in the following image:

- Training simulator
- Training engine
- Training curriculum 
- Integrated simulator
- Trained AI, also known as a Bonsai brain

## Example scenario

Let's suppose you work for a soap manufacturing company. The company uses a process called extrusion to produce the soap. Engineers  at the company think that changes in manufacturing could yield significant production increases. The company uses an advanced process control (APC) system, controlled by experienced operators to manage production. These operators send commands to the APC system to control manufacturing. The APC system then adjusts the manufacturing equipment accordingly.

Because of the complexity of the soap manufacturing process, it can be difficult to control and therefore optimize production. This is because there are so many variables involved in production, such as:

- Adjustments in the parts of the manufacturing equipment. 
- Variations in raw materials.
- Wear and tear on the machinery.
- Residue from previous production runs. 

The company can benefit from using Project Bonsai because a Bonsai brain is able to:

- Automatically signal the company's APC system.
- Adapt fast to production changeovers.
- Apply short-term process changes due to residue.
- Apply long-term process changes due to equipment wear and tear.
- Advise operators to make adjustments instead of controlling the extruder directly.

## What will we be doing?

You'll assess the capabilities of Project Bonsai and determine whether it's a good choice to help manage implement AI. To do this, you'll:

- Identify the key features and components of Bonsai.
- Describe the function of these components.
- Determine whether Bonsai is a good fit for your organization.


## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to determine whether Bonsai is suitable for your organization. You'll also be able to describe how Bonsai can help accelerate AI-powered automation development.
