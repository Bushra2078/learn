Microsoft Project Bonsai is a low-code AI platform. It helps accelerate AI-powered automation development. You can use Bonsai to build AI components that can:

- Optimize process variables
- Improve production efficiency
- Help reduce downtime

You can use Bonsai to either:

- Provide operator guidance 
- Make independent decisions 

Bonsai provides an intuitive interface that lets you create AI. Bonsai consists of a number of logical elements, displayed in the following image:

- Training simulator
- Training engine
- Training curriculum 
- Integrated simulator
- Trained AI, also known as a Bonsai brain

<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly orient the learner to the subject area covered in this module
    
    Heading: do not add an H1 or H2 title here, the auto-generated H1 will appear above this content automatically
    
    Example: "Implementing a business process can be challenging because you typically need to make diverse services work together. Think about everything your company uses to store and process data: Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Oracle, Twitter, YouTube, Dropbox, Google services, Azure Cognitive Services, and so on. How do you integrate all these products? Azure Logic Apps gives you pre-built components to connect to hundreds of services. You use a graphical design tool to put the pieces together in any combination you need and Logic Apps will run your process automatically in the cloud."

## Example scenario

Let's suppose you work for a soap manufacturing company. The company uses a process called extrusion to produce the soap. Engineers  at the company think that changes in manufacturing could yield significant production increases. The company uses an advanced process control (APC) system, controlled by experienced operators to manage production. These operators send commands to the APC system to control manufacturing. The APC system then adjusts the manufacturing equipment accordingly.

Because of the complexity of the soap manufacturing process, it can be difficult to control and therefore optimize production. This is because there are so many variables involved in production, such as:

- Adjustments in the parts of the manufacturing equipment. 
- Variations in raw materials.
- Wear and tear on the machinery.
- Residue from previous production runs. 

The company can benefit from using Project Bonsai because a Bonsai brain is able to:

- Automatically signal the company's APC system.
- Adapt fast to production changeovers.
- Apply short-term process changes due to residue.
- Apply long-term process changes due to equipment wear and tear.
- Advise operators to make adjustments instead of controlling the extruder directly.

<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts. Your scenario should have 2-3 customer tasks that together represent the most-common use cases for the product.
    
    Heading: use the H2 "Example scenario"
    
    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company that is launching a new product. You sell the shoes on your website, manage your cloud-hosted advertising videos, and monitor social media to gauge reactions to the launch. The following illustration shows these processes. Notice how the tasks include both customer-facing processes like direct sales and administrative tasks like auto-archiving old videos. Here, you'll see how Logic Apps automates these types of business processes."

## What will we be doing?

You'll assess the capabilities of Project Bonsai and determine whether it's a good choice to help manage implement AI. To do this, you'll:

- Identify the key features and components of Bonsai.
- Describe the function of these components.
- Determine whether Bonsai is a good fit for your organization.

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.
    
    Heading: use the H2 "What will we be doing?"
    
    Example: "Weâ€™ll analyze the capabilities of Logic Apps to help you decide when to use them:
                * **Launch**: what conditions can you set to launch your app?
                * **Connect**: which services can you connect to?
                * **Branch**: what types of business logic can you add to your app?"

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to determine whether Bonsai is suitable for your organization. You'll also be able to describe how Bonsai can help accelerate AI-powered automation development. 

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: The title of an "Introduction to..." tells our customers that this is a good place to start their learning. This helps our customers find the right content quickly. The trade-off is that the title does not reflect the terminal learning objective of the module. The "goal" section of the introduction is your chance to provide the terminal learning objective. Write a statement that is outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"
    
    Heading: use the H2 "What is the main goal?"
    
    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to decide whether Logic Apps is a good choice to automate your business processes."
