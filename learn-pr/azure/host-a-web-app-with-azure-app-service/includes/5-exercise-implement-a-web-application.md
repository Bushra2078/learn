In this unit, you'll use developer tools to create the code for a starter web application.

## Create a new web project

::: zone pivot="csharp"

The heart of the .NET CLI tools is the `dotnet` command-line tool. Using this command, you will create a new ASP.NET Core web project.

First, let's install the appropriate version of `dotnet` into the Cloud Shell. For this exercise, we'll be using SDK version 3.1.102.

1. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell on the right to download and install dotnet.

    ```bash
    wget -q -O - https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash -s -- --version 3.1.102
    export PATH="~/.dotnet:$PATH"
    echo "export PATH=~/.dotnet:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

1. Next, run the following command to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC application named "BestBikeApp".

    ```bash
    dotnet new mvc --name BestBikeApp
    ```

The command will create a new folder named "BestBikeApp" to hold your project.

### Optionally test your web app

Open a second command shell session, for example by browsing to <https://shell.azure.com/>. You can test your application locally on Azure. To do so, use the following steps:

1. From your primary command shell session, run the following commands to build and run your web application.

    ```bash
    cd BestBikeApp
    dotnet run
    ```

    You should get something like the following.

    ```console
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Hosting environment: Development
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Content root path: /home/user/BestBikeApp
    ```

    The output describes the situation after starting your app: the application is running and listening at port 5000.

1. From your second command shell session, run the following command to browse to your web application.

    ```bash
    curl -kL http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

    You should see some HTML appear, ending in the following lines:
    
   
            <div class="text-center">
            <h1 class="display-4">Welcome</h1>
            <p>Learn about <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core">building Web apps with ASP.NET Core</a>.</p>
        </div>

                </main>
            </div>

            <footer class="border-top footer text-muted">
                <div class="container">
                    &copy; 2021 - BestBikeApp - <a href="/Home/Privacy">Privacy</a>
                </div>
            </footer>
            <script src="/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
            <script src="/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
            <script src="/js/site.js?v=4q1jwFhaPaZgr8WAUSrux6hAuh0XDg9kPS3xIVq36I0"></script>

        </body>
        </html>
  
  

1. From your primary command shell session, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to quit your web app.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="java"

To create a starter web application, we'll use Maven, a commonly used project management and build tool for Java apps. We'll use the `maven-archetype-webapp` template to generate the code for our web application.

1. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell now to create a new web app.

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=example.demo -DartifactId=helloworld -DinteractiveMode=false -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
    ```

1. Now, run these commands to change to the new "helloworld" application directory and package the application for deployment:

    ```bash
    cd helloworld
    mvn package
    ```

1. When the command finishes running, run these commands to open the "target" directory and list its content.

    ```bash
    cd target
    ls
    ```

You'll see a file listed called `helloworld.war`. This is the web application package that we will deploy to App Service.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="node"

To create a starter Node.js web application, we'll use Node Package Manager (`npm`) along with some JavaScript code to run the actual web page processing.

1. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to create a new `package.json` that will describe our Node.js application.

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mkdir helloworld
    cd helloworld
    npm init -y
    ```

This will create a new `package.json` file in the current folder. You should see it in the current folder if you enter `ls` in the terminal window. We will need a JavaScript file to run our website logic. Because this is just a basic example, we will only need one file `index.js`.

1. Run the following command in the terminal to create the file.

    ```bash
    touch index.js
    ```

1. Now we have to make a few edits to both of our files. Run the following command in the terminal to open an interactive editor.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Select the `package.json` file, and make the following edits to the `scripts` section to use Node.js to launch the web app.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "helloworld",
      ...
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js"
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

1. Save the file by selecting the **...** menu, or press (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux, and <kbd>Command+S</kbd> on macOS).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Whenever you edit a file in the editor, make sure to save afterwards by selecting the **...** menu in the top right cornder of the editor, or bypressing (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux; <kbd>Command+S</kbd> on macOS). To exit the editor, press <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> on Windows and Linux; <kbd>Command+Q</kbd> on macOS.

1. Switch to the `index.js` file, and add the following contents to it. This is a small Node.js program that always responds with "Hello World!" when any GET request is made to the server.

    ```javascript
    const http = require('http');
    
    const server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
        response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
        response.end("<html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>");
    });
    
    const port = process.env.PORT || 1337;
    server.listen(port);
    
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
    ```

1. Save your file and exit the editor by selecting the **&#9776;** icon on the top right, and then selecting **Save** > **Close Editor** from the context menu, or by using the accelerator keys <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> on Windows and Linux; <kbd>Command+S</kbd> and <kbd>Command+Q</kbd> on macOS.

### Optionally test your web app

While you are running the helloworld web app, you can verify it is running locally by opening a second command shell session. 

1. From a new browser tab, browse to <https://shell.azure.com/>.

1. From your primary command shell session, run the following commands to start your web application.

    ```bash
    cd ~/helloworld
    npm start
    ```

1. From your second command shell session, run the following command to browse to your web application.

    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:1337/
    ```

    You should see the following.

    ```html
    <html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>
    ```

1. From your primary command shell session, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to quit your web app, and then close the second shell session browser tab.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="python"

To create a starter web application, we'll use the web application framework Flask.

1. Run the following commands to set up a virtual environment, and install Flask in your profile.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install flask
    ```

1. Run these commands in Azure Cloud Shell to create the directory for your new web app.

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/BestBikeApp
    cd ~/BestBikeApp
    ```

1. Create a new file for your web app by opening *application.py* in the python interactive editor.

    ```bash
    code application.py
    ```

1. Copy and paste the following Python code to create the main web app functionality.

    ```python
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route("/")
    def hello():
        return "<html><body><h1>Hello Best Bike App!</h1></body></html>\n"
    ```

1. Save the file and exit the editor. Save your file and exit the editor by selecting the **...** menu on the top right, and then selecting **Save** > **Close Editor**, or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> on Windows and Linux; <kbd>Command+S</kbd> and <kbd>Command+Q</kbd> on macOS.

1. To deploy your application to Azure, you will need to save the list of application requirements you made for it in a *requirements.txt* file. To do so, run the following command.

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

### Optionally test your web app

You can test your application locally in Azure while it was running.

1. Open a second command shell session in a new browser tab  <https://shell.azure.com/>.

1. From your primary command shell session (to the right), run the following commands to start your web application.

    ```bash
    cd ~/BestBikeApp
    export FLASK_APP=application.py
    flask run
    ```

1. From your second command shell session, run the following command to browse to your web application.

    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

    You should see the following HTML output.

    ```html
    <html><body><h1>Hello Best Bike App!</h1></body></html>
    ```

1. From your primary command shell session, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to quit your web app, and then close the secondary Azure Cloud Shell.
