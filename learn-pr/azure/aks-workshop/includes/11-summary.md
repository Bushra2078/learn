## Clean up resources

In this module, we created resources using our Azure subscription. We want to clean up these resources so that there's no continued charge against our account for these resources.

1. In Azure, select **Resource groups** on the left.

1. Find the **aksworkshop** resource group, or whatever resource group name you used, and select it.

1. In the **Overview** tab of the resource group, select **Delete resource group**.

1. This step opens a new dialog box. Type the name of the resource group again and select **Delete** to delete all of the resources we created in this module.
