The application stores and retrieves item ratings from a MongoDB. In this excercise, you're going to deploy MongoDB to the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster via Helm.

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is an application package manager for Kubernetes and offers a way to easily deploy applications and services, via what are called [charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/). A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.

Charts are stored in Helm chart repositories. The official chart repository is maintained [here](https://github.com/helm/charts) and the [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh) provides a way to discover and view documentation of such charts.

## Add the Helm stable repository

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true) with your Azure subscription.

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell from the Azure portal using the Cloud Shell icon.

    ![Image showing Cloud Shell icon in the Azure portal](../media/2-portal-cloudshell-access.png)

1. To use Helm you will need the `helm` command, which is already installed in the Cloud Shell. Helm provides a standard repository of charts for many different software packages, and it has one for [MongoDB](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/mongodb). The MongoDB chart is part of the official Helm **stable** charts repository. You'll need to configure the Helm client to use the stable repository by running the `helm repo add` command.

    ```azurecli
    helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
    ```

    Once this is added, you will be able to list the charts you can install:

    ```output
    helm search repo stable
    NAME                                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION                     DESCRIPTION
    stable/acs-engine-autoscaler            2.2.2           2.1.1                           DEPRECATED Scales worker nodes within agent pools

    stable/ambassador                       4.1.0           0.81.0                          A Helm chart for Datawire Ambassador
    # ... and many more
    ```

## Install the MongoDB chart

1. To install a chart, you can run the `helm install` command. In the example below, the release is called **ratings** and is deployed into the **ratingsapp** namespace.

    ```azurecli
    helm install ratings stable/mongodb --namespace ratingsapp --set mongodbUsername=ratingsuser,mongodbPassword=ratingspassword,mongodbDatabase=ratingsdb
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You provide parameters with the `--set` switch and a comma separated list of `key=value` pairs. Pay attention to the `mongodbUsername`, `mongodbPassword` and `mongodbDatabase` parameters and their values, which set the username, password and database name respectively. The application expects that the database is called **ratingsdb**. The `helm install` command is a very powerful command with many capabilities. To learn more about it, check out the [Using Helm Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/).

    Once released, you should get an output similar to this. Make note of the MongoDB host, which should be **ratings-mongodb.ratingsapp.svc.cluster.local**, if you used the same parameters.

    ```output
    NAME: ratings
    LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 30 23:00:47 2019
    NAMESPACE: ratingsapp
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    TEST SUITE: None
    NOTES:
    ** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **
    
    MongoDB can be accessed via port 27017 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
    
        ratings-mongodb.ratingsapp.svc.cluster.local
    ```

## Create a Kubernetes secret to hold the MongoDB details

 Kubernetes has a concept of [secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords. Putting this information in a secret is safer and more flexible than hard coding it in a Pod definition or in a container image.

 In the previous step, you installed MongoDB using Helm, with a specified username, password and a database name. You're now going to store those details in a Kubernetes secret that will be used later.

 1. The ratings API expects to find the connection details to the MongoDB in the form of `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`. Youâ€™ll need to replace the **[username]**, **[password]** and **[endpoint]** with the ones you used when creating the database. For example `mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@ratings-mongodb.ratingsapp.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb`.

 1. Use the `kubectl create secret generic` command to create a secret called **mongosecret** in the **ratingsapp** namespace. A Kubernetes secret can hold several items, indexed by key. In this case, the secret will only contain one key, called **MONGOCONNECTION** and the value will be the constructed connection string from the previous step.

     ```azurecli
     kubectl create secret generic mongosecret --namespace ratingsapp --from-literal=MONGOCONNECTION="mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@ratings-mongodb.ratingsapp.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb"
     ```

1. You can validate that the secret has been created by running the `kubectl describe secret` command.

    ```azurecli
    kubectl describe secret mongosecret --namespace ratingsapp
    ```

    You should get an output similar to this.

     ```output
    Name:         mongosecret
    Namespace:    ratingsapp
    Labels:       <none>
    Annotations:  <none>
    
    Type:  Opaque
    
    Data
    ====
    MONGOCONNECTION:  98 bytes
    ```
