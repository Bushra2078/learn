The goal of this module was to help you decide if Azure Monitor is a tool you want to use with your Azure resources. We explored some of the options available with Azure Monitor, and discussed the following aspects:

* Azure Monitor
* Azure Monitor Metrics
* Azure Monitor Logs

We showed examples of how the features of Azure Monitor can provide insights into the performance of your Azure resources. Reviewing the Azure monitoring metrics showed how near-real-time monitoring is possible. The Log options showed how you might want to consider logging data for trending and analysis. By looking at visualizations, you got an idea of the different display and presentation options available.

Azure Monitor helps you maximize the availability and performance of your applications and services. It delivers a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. This information helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identify issues affecting them and the resources on which they depend.
