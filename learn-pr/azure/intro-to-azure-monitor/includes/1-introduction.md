Monitoring provides insights into many aspects of resource performance, security, and health. Azure Monitor is the Azure platform service that provides a single source for monitoring all your Azure resources.

Consider a web application that you host on Azure. You decided to move your application from your on-premises infrastructure due to performance issues. During annual back-to-school sales campaigns, your website was being overloaded, and increased response times were causing users to leave. You didn't want to spend more money on new server hardware just to support those limited engagement peak loads.

Azure offers the ability to scale up or scale out your application when needed, then automatically scale it back when resource needs drop off. But initially, you might not know where the capacity issues are. You can use Azure Monitor to collect metrics and logs to determine where your needs are, and base your scaling strategy decisions on concrete data.

Scalability might be only one of the reasons you host your application on Azure, and deploying the resources isn't the end of your involvement. Other aspects of your application might not be providing the performance you or your users expect. You need to know whether you're gaining benefits from Azure hosting to prove your return on investment.
