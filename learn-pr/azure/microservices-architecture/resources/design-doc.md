## Role(s)

- Solution Architect
- Developer

## Level

- Intermediate

## Product(s)

- *Add the product(s)*

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of application and system architecture
- Basic knowledge of Docker containers

## Summary

Improve development agility, deployment, fault tolerance, and scalability by moderninzing your application with a microservices architecture.

## Learning objectives

1. Identify the properties and benefits of a microservices application
1. Decompose a monolithic application into a microservices architecture

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *Decompose a monolithic application into a microservices architecture*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice (from the module proposal):

    *Add your scenario [(Guidance)](id-guidance-scenarios.md)*

1. **Learning-content unit title**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
    - Enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective
        - Information needed to accomplish the enabling objective

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*?

    - Question type
    - Question type

1. **Exercise - exercise unit title**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    1. Step
    1. Step

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?
