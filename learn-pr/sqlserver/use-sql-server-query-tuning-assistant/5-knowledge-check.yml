  questions:
  - content: "On which versions of SQL Server can you use the Query Store?"
    choices:
    - content: "Any version after SQL Server 2005."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store was introduced in SQL Server 2016. Any SQL Server can use the Query Store, regardless of database compatibility levels."
    - content: "Any version after SQL Server 2016."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Query Store was introduced in SQL Server 2016. Any SQL Server 2016 or later instance can use the Query Store, regardless of database compatibility levels."
    - content: "Any version after SQL Server 2016, with databases that have compatibility levels of 130 or higher."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store was introduced in SQL Server 2016. Any SQL Server 2016 or later instance can use the Query Store, regardless of database compatibility levels."
  - content: "Which of the following tools predicts how many rows a query is likely to return?"
    choices:
    - content: "The cardinality estimator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The database version determines the cardinality estimator, which predicts how many rows a query is likely to return."
    - content: "The Query Tuning Assistant"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The QTA compares query statistics, but doesn't predict how many rows a query is likely to return."
    - content: "Automatic plan correction"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Automatic plan correction autotunes queries and applies the last good plan, but doesn't predict how many rows a query is likely to return."
  - content: "Which of the following statements about automatic plan correction is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "Is set at the server level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Automatic plan correction is set at the database level, and instructs SQL Server to use the last good query plan."
    - content: "Can mean rolling back to an earlier cardinality estimator."
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "Automatic plan correction instructs SQL Server to use the last good plan if regression is found, and can mean rolling back to an earlier cardinality estimator."
    - content: "Always uses the current cardinality estimator that's mapped to the compatibility level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Automatic plan correction instructs SQL Server to use the last good plan if regression is found, and can mean rolling back to an earlier cardinality estimator."
  - content: "What does the Query Tuning Assistant do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Collects data to monitor queries or measure the effects of a single change."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store collects data to monitor queries or measure the effects of a single change."
    - content: "Predicts the outcome of queries based on database compatibility level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The cardinality estimator, not the QTA, predicts how many rows a query is likely to return based on compatibility level."
    - content: "Finds queries that are beginning to regress and automatically experiments to find solutions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The QTA uses Query Store data to find underperforming queries and automatically seeks solutions to speed them up."
  - content: "How long should the Query Store run to gather sufficient workload information on a database?"
    choices:
    - content: "Long enough for the Query Store to capture a typical cycle of business activity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Let the Query Store capture a typical cycle of business activity, including regular business hours, nightly processing, maintenance windows, and other scheduled or periodic activity."
    - content: "One week."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For many businesses, a week's activity is sufficient, but a typical business cycle can be much shorter or longer."
    - content: "It depends on the Query Store version."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can enable Query Store on all SQL Server versions starting with SQL Server 2016, but the SQL Server version has no relation to the amount of data needed."
  - content: "What's the correct order of steps to use QTA to evaluate the effects on query performance of upgrading a database compatibility level from 110 to 160?"
    choices:
    - content: "Migrate the database to SQL Server 2022. Upgrade the compatibility level. Collect Query Store statistics on the database after the upgrade. Use the QTA to find regressing queries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For the QTA to function correctly, you must collect baseline Query Store data before you upgrade the database compatibility level."
    - content: "Enable the Query Store on the database and collect baseline query statistics. Migrate the database to SQL Server 2022. Upgrade the compatibility level. Collect Query Store statistics after the upgrade. Use the QTA to find regressing queries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store was implemented in SQL Server 2016, so you must have at least a SQL Server 2016 (130) database to enable the Query Store and collect baseline statistics."
    - content: "Migrate the database to SQL Server 2022. Enable the Query Store on the database and collect baseline query statistics. Upgrade the compatibility level. Collect Query Store statistics after the upgrade. Use the QTA to find regressing queries."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "For the QTA to function correctly, you should migrate the database to SQL Server 2022, collect baseline Query Store statistics, upgrade the compatibility level, collect more Query Store statistics, and then use the QTA to find regressing queries."
  - content: "Which of the following isn't a valid setting for Query Store in SQL Server 2022?"
    choices:
    - content: "Off"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Off, Read only, and Read write are valid settings for Query Store in SQL Server 2022."
    - content: "Active"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Off, Read only, and Read write are the only valid settings for Query Store in SQL Server 2022."
    - content: "Read only"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Off, Read only, and Read write are valid settings for Query Store in SQL Server 2022."
    - content: "Read write"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Off, Read only, and Read write are valid settings for Query Store in SQL Server 2022."
