In this module, you used Azure Data Studio and Transact-SQL queries to collect and display performance data. Because Windows Performance Manager is not available on Linux, you can see that this technique may provide an important source of information when you are not using Windows in your SQL Server environment. You cannot optimize performance unless you can first measure it and observe how it varies over time.

You also used this technique to observe how a query plan regression problem negatively impacts database performance and how th query store and automatic tuning can be used to mitigate such problems.
