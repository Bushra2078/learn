You're a database administrator for a law firm, and you need to upgrade several CRM databases to SQL Server 2019. The source databases include versions from SQL Server 2008R2 through to SQL Server 2016. You'll use the **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** to check the compatibility of these older databases before upgrading to SQL Server 2019. 

In this exercise, you'll run the DMA compatibility and performance assessments on a SQL Server 2008 database, then view the results for a SQL Server 2019 target.

## Run the compatibility assessment

Continue by running the DMA and using it to assess the Adventure Works database:

1. On the left, select the **menu** icon to display the flyout, and then select **+ New**.
1. In the **New** flyout, leave the **Project type** as **Assessment**, and in the **Project name** box, type **`AdventureWorks 2008-2019`**.
1. Leave the **Source server type** as **SQL Server**, in the **Target server type** list, select **SQL Server**, and then select **Create**.
1. On the **Options** tab, ensure the **Select target version** list is set to **SQL Server 2019 on Windows**.
1. Select the **New features' recommendation** check box, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Connect to a server** flyout, in the **Server name** box, type **`localhost`**.
1. Leave the **Authentication type** as **Windows Authentication**, clear the **Encrypt connection** check box, and then select **Connect**.
1. In the **Add sources** flyout, select the **AdventureWorks2008R2** check box, and then select **Add**.
1. On the **Select sources** tab, select **Start Assessment**.

On the **Review results** tab, when the assessment completes, the results are displayed.

## Review the assessment results

Now you can examine the recommendations generated by the DMA:

1. On the **Compatibility 150 (1)** tab, notice that the **Behavior changes** tab is highlighted, and lists an issue for review.
1. Under **Issue details**, read the **Recommendation** text.
1. On the right side of the tab, look at the **Impacted objects** list.
1. Select the row containing **HumanResources**. Note the **Object details**.
1. Select the rows below, and note the **Object details** changes.

## Export the assessment results

To export the results into a flexible file format, follow these steps:

1. On the **Review results** tab, at the bottom of the page, select **Export report**.
1. In the **Save assessment report** dialog box, change the location to the **Desktop**.
1. In the **File name** box, type **`AdventureWorks 2008-2019`**.
1. In the **Save as type** list, select  **CSV Files (*.csv)**, and then select **Save**.
1. Minimize the **Data Migration Assistant** window, and on the **Desktop**, double-click the **AdventureWorks 2008-2019.csv** file.
1. In the **How do you want to open this file?** dialog box, select **Notepad**, and then select **OK**.
1. Scroll through the list of issues and recommendations to view the full results from the assessment. When you're finished, close Notepad.
