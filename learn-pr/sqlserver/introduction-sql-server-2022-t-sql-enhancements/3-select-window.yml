  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "In the context of the WINDOW clause, what does a named window specification refer to?"
    choices:
    - content: "A specific table in the database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A named window specification refers to a reusable definition that can be used with multiple window functions in a query, not a specific table in the database."
    - content: "A definition that can be used across multiple data calculations"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A named window specification refers to a reusable frame definition that can be used with multiple window functions in a query, simplifying complex calculations and aggregations."
    - content: "A predefined set of SQL functions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A named window specification refers to a reusable definition that can be used with multiple window functions in a query, not a predefined set of SQL functions."
  - content: "What is the one advantage of using named window specifications in a WINDOW clause?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reducing code duplication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "One advantage of using named window specifications in a WINDOW clause is to reduce code duplication by allowing the reuse of a single window definition for multiple window functions in a query."
    - content: "Automatically optimizing query performance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While using named window specifications might improve code readability and maintainability, it doesn't automatically optimize query performance."
    - content: "Enforcing data consistency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using named window specifications in a WINDOW clause helps to reduce code duplication and simplify complex calculations, but it doesn't enforce data consistency."
