<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly summarize the key skill this unit will teach

    Heading: none

    Example: "Organizations often have multiple storage accounts to let them implement different sets of requirements."

## Memory Grant Feedback
Prior to SQL Server 2022, memory grant feedback was based on the most recent execution for a specific query. This could result in some cases of different feedback adjustments which could lead to the query processor to disable memory grant feedback for a specific query. In SQL Server 2022, memory grant feedback uses a percentile method to look at memory grants over several executions before using a memory grant feedback.

Additionally, prior to SQL Server 2022, memory grant feedback was only stored in a cached plan in memory. If the cache plan was evicted, memory grant feedback would have to be recalculated on new query executions. In SQL Server 2022, if the Query Store. is enabled memory grant feedback will be persisted in the Query Store. You can view memory grant feedback persistence from the sys.query_store_plan_feedback catalog view.

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that will be solved by the content in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "In the shoe-company scenario, we will use a Twitter trigger to launch our app when tweets containing our product name are available."

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what's covered in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will learn the policy factors that are controlled by a storage account so you can decide how many accounts you need."
-->
TODO: write your prose table-of-contents

<!-- 4. Visual element (highly recommended) ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Visual element, like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote. Ideally, you'll provide an image that illustrates the customer problem the unit will solve; it can use the scenario to do this or stay generic (i.e. not address the scenario).

    Heading: none

TODO: add a visual element

<!-- 5. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to perform this sub-task.

    Structure: Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. 1-3 paragraphs of text
        3. Visual like an image, table, list, code sample, or blockquote.
