In this module, you used Docker to configure and run containers on a Linux host with SQL Server 2017. Containers provide a light-weight and highly-scalable way to virtualize multiple services on a single host. 

SQL Server 2017 is the first version of Microsoft SQL Server that supports installation on Linux and installation in containers. You now have more hosting choices than ever before for mission-critical databases.
