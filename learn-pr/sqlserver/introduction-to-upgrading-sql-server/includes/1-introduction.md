Organizations with many databases often have a complex setup with many different database servers running different versions of Microsoft SQL Server or other platforms. Such environments present complex problems to administrators seeking to ensure that their software is up-to-date.

Suppose you are the senior administrator working for a long-established law firm. Over the years, the firm has expanded organically and by acquiring smaller companies. Because each component company used databases in different ways, this has resulted in several different versions of SQL Server in use in different departments and locations. Some of these versions are quite old, no longer supported by Microsoft, and not in compliance with data protection legislation in your jurisdiction.

You have decided to upgrade older versions of SQL Server and you want to use the best tools to upgrade your  databases with the least amount of impact on business systems and end-users.
