To find out how your SQL Server is performing, you can query Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) such as **dm_os_performance_counters**. However, to make trends in performance a demand clearer, it's helpful to display time series charts of these counters. In this module, you used Azure Data Studio and Transact-SQL queries to collect and display performance data. 

You also used this technique to observe how a query plan regression problem negatively impacts database performance. Query Store and automatic tuning can be used to mitigate such problems.
