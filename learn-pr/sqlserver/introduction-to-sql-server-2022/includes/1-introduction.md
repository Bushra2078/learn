SQL Server 2022 is Microsoft's latest major release of the SQL Server product. SQL Server 2022 is a hybrid data platform powered by innovations in security, performance, availability, and data virtualization. 

## Scenario

SQL Server 2022 is designed to help organizations looking to modernize their data estate from older versions of SQL Server. SQL Server 2022 provides new cloud connected capabilities for those looking to enable hybrid data scenarios.

Organizations can accelerate performance for their applications with no code changes, protect data integrity with blockchain capabilities, and achieve increased scalability and availability for critical data.

SQL Server 2022 also allows developers to build new applications connecting relational data with data lakes containing parquet files and delta tables using Azure or S3 compatible storage providers.
