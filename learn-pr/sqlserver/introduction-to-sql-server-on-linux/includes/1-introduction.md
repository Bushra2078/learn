Microsoft SQL Server has many features that are unique when comparing it to other database management systems:

**Performance** As it is currently first in the TPC-E benchmark for performance, along with being first for performance in the TPC-H 1TB, 10TB, and 30TB benchmarks.

**Flexibility** Developers and administrators to choose their platform and language, with support for Transact-SQL, Java, C/C++, C#/VB.NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.

**Security** According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), SQL Server has been the most secure database over the last seven years.

**Intelligence** As SQL Server is the only commercial Rational Database Management System (RDBMS) with AI built-in. Supporting R, Python, and Java running next to the data in-memory and at massive scale. SQL Server is also intelligent in adapting to your workloads, optimizing queries automatically for better performance.

**Scalability** With support for running in-memory across all workloads, running on-premise, hybrid or in the cloud.

**Business Intelligence (BI)** With an end-to-end solution for reporting, scaling from mobile to desktop at a fraction of the cost of other systems.  

Because of these reasons Wide World Importers are very interested in running SQL Server 2017 on Linux. They understand that not all the SQL Server capabilities are available on Linux yet, but they are intrigued by the performance, security, and functionality of SQL Server.
