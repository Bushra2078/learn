When switching from traditional transactional business model to SaaS, you gain more responsibility for protecting your customers’ data. That means, that you have to make sure that your solution is up-to-date with security standards and required compliance regulations.

### Compliance

There are several regulations you need to keep in mind depending on the region where your customers reside and where you provide services.

Just to name a few: 
* GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation, for companies whose customers reside in EU)
* CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
* LGPD (Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteçao de Dados) 
* Canadian Digital Charter Implementation Act
* PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law in China)
* and many other, depending on the region 

### Security

Besides making sure to comply with the regulations, it is important to put the required security controls and procedures in place. For SaaS companies, like other software companies, it is recommended to follow methodologies, such as SDLC (Security Development Lifecycle) to make sure that security is part of the ongoing product development process.

The Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) consists of a set of practices that support security assurance and compliance requirements. The SDL helps developers build more secure software by reducing the number and severity of vulnerabilities in software, while reducing development cost. Here you can find more about which practices Microsoft defines as part of the SDLC: [Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle Practices](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl/practices) 

When using Microsoft Azure as a cloud provider for your solution, it’s easy to benefit from all the work that Microsoft is already doing to protect your and your customers' data and comply with the latest regulations.
