## Plan for SaaS business

In this learn module you have learned about main concepts for Software-as-a-Service, such as:

- Most common reasons why SaaS model is so popular, such as high customer demand for consumption model, faster time to market for new functionality and elevated security.
- Why adoption is at the core of the consumption-based model, how adoption affects churn and company financial results.
- Difference between SLA and SLO and how to define simple SLOs for your solution.
- Available options for pricing model for SaaS service



If you are getting started with your SaaS business, the first stage is all about business level decisions. 

- What is the problem you're trying to solve? 
- How are you going to solve it? What is your pricing model? 
- Who are your customers and how will they interact with the application? 

The answers to these questions will be the requirements for your SaaS application, as we have seen in the example when defining Target Market Segment for Contoso.

The approach each individual company takes depends on many factors, including the current stage of business. Some startups or new software companies still have the task of finding product market fit and defining their sustainable business model which is ready for growth and scale.
