      In Azure, all resources are allocated in a resource management group. Resource groups provide logical groupings of resources
        that make them easier to work with as a collection. For this tutorial, all of the created resources go into a
        single group named `TutorialResources`.

        ```azurecli
        az group create --name TutorialResources --location eastus
        ```
