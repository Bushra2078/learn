    For the last activity in this tutorial is complete, it's time to clean up the created resources. You can delete individual resources with the `delete` command, but the safest way to remove all resources in a resource group is with `group delete`.

  ```azurecli
     az group delete --name TutorialResources --no-wait
   ```

  This command deletes the resources created during the tutorial, and is guaranteed to deallocate
        them in the correct order. The `--no-wait` parameter keeps the CLI from blocking while the
        deletion takes place. If you want to wait until the deletion is complete or watch it progress, use the `group wait` command.

        ```azurecli
        az group wait --name TutorialResources --deleted
        ```

        With cleanup completed, the tutorial is finished. Continue on for a summary of everything
        you learned and links to resources that will help you with your next steps.
