When Microsoft partners add their solutions to the commercial marketplace, one way that customers can find those products and services is by visiting the web storefronts. You go to the [commercial marketplace publisher guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/comparing-appsource-azure-marketplace) to learn more.

## Azure Marketplace

As you read the documentation, you learn that Azure Marketplace is geared toward IT professionals and developers. It contains technical solutions that are certified to run on Microsoft Azure.

Azure Marketplace has thousands of applications and services that are made to extend directly into users’ Azure infrastructure. Products in this storefront include Azure building blocks, digital cloud services, finished software solutions, and consulting and managed services. Products and services are organized by category and easy to filter, making it easy for customers to find the right app or service.

Your customers can access Azure Marketplace online through the web storefront at <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com>.

Because Azure Marketplace is a part of Azure, they can also access these solutions through the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com>. Any time Azure users click “Create a resource” on the Azure portal homepage, they’re accessing solutions from Azure Marketplace.

Both the web storefront and the Azure portal experience enable customers to quickly find, try, buy, and deploy solutions to Azure online in minutes.

In addition to the cloud products and services available through both the web storefront and the portal, the [Azure Marketplace web storefront](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) also lists consulting and managed services offered by Microsoft partners to help customers in myriad areas including analytics, DevOps, migration, and security.

## Microsoft AppSource

The Microsoft AppSource storefront is geared toward business users and business decision makers, and contains business software that extends directly into Azure, Dynamics 365, Office 365, and the Power Platform. Microsoft AppSource also contains web applications, which are hosted on the cloud and accessed over the internet. Solutions are organized by category and industry and are easy to filter, making it simple for customers to find the right app or service.

Your customers can access Microsoft AppSource online through the web storefront at <https://appsource.microsoft.com>.
