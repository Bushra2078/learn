[Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) is the single destination for your organization to manage your business relationship and partnering opportunities with Microsoft, customers, and other partners. It's where you can access all of your workspaces, account settings, and support. 

## Workspaces

Partner Center is organized into **workspaces** that bring related tasks and information together.

Workspaces group tasks and information into distinct areas. You can access these workspaces through the tiles on the dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may not see all of these workspaces in your portal based on your permissions and memberships.

From your dashboard, you can hover over any of the tiles to see information about that workspace and get links to learn more.

The following video describes more about what workspaces are and how they work.
