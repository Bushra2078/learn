[Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) is a web-based, unified console that provides access to a wide range of partner-centric activities such as membership, benefits, and account settings, all through a graphical user interface. The portal uses the concept of workspaces to group related tasks and information together to ensure that you can quickly get to and complete your work.

Partner Center helps you:

- Manage your Microsoft account and users
- Engage with customers
- Build relationships with other partners
- Enroll in incentive programs
- Manage customer subscriptions
- Bill and get paid
- Contact support
- Publish or explore offers in the Microsoft commercial marketplace, a catalog of thousands of customer-facing transactable services and applications built and delivered by our independent software vendor (ISV) partners
