Our goal was to introduce you to Partner Center. We presented content on how to complete the following tasks:

- Manage your Microsoft account and users
- Engage with customers
- Build relationships with other partners
- Enroll in incentive programs
- Manage customer subscriptions
- Bill and get paid
- Contact support
- Publish or explore offers in the Microsoft commercial marketplace

We explained how to navigate the Partner Center dashboard to make managing your partner relationships easier. We also explained workspaces and roles to get information that is custom tailored to your needs.

Partner Center streamlines several business processes to make it easier for Microsoft partners to manage their relationship with Microsoft and their customers. Partner Center gives you access to the tools you need to get work done.
