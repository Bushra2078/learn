Our goal was to introduce you to Partner Center. We presented content on how to complete the following tasks:

- Manage **Account settings** for you and your users
- Download invoices and reconciliation files in the **Billing** workspace
- Connect with your **Customers**
- Explore **Incentives** programs offered by Microsoft
- Get valuable **Insights** on how to grow your business
- Discover and manage **Referrals**
- Get **Pricing** information on the products you want to sell

We explained how to navigate the Partner Center dashboard to make managing your partner relationships easier. We also explained workspaces and roles to get information that is custom tailored to your needs.

Partner Center streamlines several business processes to make it easier for Microsoft partners to manage their relationship with Microsoft and their customers. Partner Center gives you access to the tools you need to get work done.
