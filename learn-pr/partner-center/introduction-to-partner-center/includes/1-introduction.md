In this module, you'll learn how to manage your customer relationships with Microsoft Partner Center.

This Learn module is focused on how Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) use [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) and its workspaces.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are another kind of partner, such as a marketplace publisher, you can still a learn about the use of Partner Center, but the majority of examples used will be based on CSP scenarios.

## CSP relationships

- **Indirect providers** purchase first-party and third-party offers from the Microsoft marketplace
- **Indirect resellers** are CSP partners who don't have a direct billing relationship with Microsoft
- **Direct-bill partners** have a direct billing relationship with Microsoft and can purchase offers directly from the commercial marketplace and sell them to customers

You can see how these relationships overlap in the following diagram.
