This module is focused on how Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) use [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) and its workspaces to manage business relationships. Partner Center is a web-based tool that streamlines several business processes so that Microsoft partners can easily manage their relationships with their customers and Microsoft.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a cloud provider and want to partner with Microsoft. The rapidly growing demand for cloud-based solutions and services means many opportunities for Microsoft partners of all sizes to build profitable cloud solution businesses.

Microsoft helps all partners participating in the CSP program find the best model for their business to grow. There are two models in the CSP program: the **indirect** model and the **direct-bill** model.

### Indirect model

Microsoft has built a global network of qualified indirect providers who help partners grow their cloud business successfully in the CSP program. By joining as an indirect reseller, you can accelerate your go-to-market with minimized operational complexity.

As an indirect reseller, you can work with indirect providers who can provide the tools and resources to help you manage your customer relationship. With the indirect model, you can purchase from an indirect provider who can collaborate with you for customer support and billing.

#### Indirect model requirements

- An active membership in the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program and PartnerID for the location you want to sell in
- The ability to sign legal agreements on behalf of your organization
- A relationship with an [official Microsoft indirect provider](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/cloud-solution-provider/find-a-provider) in the CSP program

### Direct-bill model

In the direct-bill model, partners purchase Microsoft products and subscriptions directly from Microsoft and sell them directly to their customers through their in-house sales staff. Partners who already operate with, or are willing to develop, the appropriate sales, billing, and support infrastructure may choose the direct model.

#### Direct-bill model requirements

- Expand your support capabilities by purchasing one-on-one, prioritized cloud support with a *Microsoft Advanced Support for Partners* package. Or, choose a *Microsoft Premier Support for Partners* package to access the complete catalog of proactive services, 24/7 elevated break/fix support, and technical account management across cloud, hybrid, and on-premises. Review the *Microsoft Partner Agreement* to further understand your support obligation.
- Have at least USD $300K in CSP program annual revenue during the preceding 12 months as an indirect reseller. (Partners can review their trailing twelve-month revenue on **Partner Center**.) The sales that make up your USD $300K trailing twelve-month revenue are subject to review and verification by Microsoft, and you may be asked to provide additional information. The USD $300K revenue requirement is calculated based on cloud revenue and excludes perpetual software in CSP.
- Meet the minimum infrastructure capabilities, such as billing and provisioning
- An active membership in the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program and an [PartnerID](/partner-center/mpn-create-a-partner-center-account.md) for the location that you want to sell in
- We recommend that you demonstrate that you provide at least one managed service, IP service, or customer solution application. [Learn more about adding managed services](https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/managed-services).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are another kind of partner, such as a marketplace publisher, you can still learn about the use of Partner Center, but this is based on CSP scenarios.

### Sell through the CSP program

The CSP program helps you to be more involved in your customers' businesses, beyond reselling licenses so you can provide them:

- **Deeper customer engagements**: Meeting regularly with your customers means you'll develop a better understanding of their business and needs.
- **Increased profits**: Offering increased support and billing services, whether on your own or through an indirect provider, opens up new revenue streams.
- **Added value**: You'll be able to offer customers industry-specific solutions bundled with Microsoft products.
- **Managed services**: You'll be well positioned to meet customer demand for managed services.

#### Where can I sell through the CSP program?

Your market includes the regions and/or countries where you can sell CSP offers. Your company's location determines your market. See [CSP program regional markets and currencies](/partner-center/regional-authorization-overview.md) for the complete list of CSP markets and currencies.

Before you can order CSP offers on behalf of a customer, the customer must sign the Microsoft Customer Agreement. You can find the applicable agreement for your customer's location at [Microsoft Customer Agreements by region and language](/partner-center/agreements.md).

#### What can I sell through the CSP program?

You can sell the full range of [Microsoft cloud services](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider/products-and-services) and various other offers that change frequently. To see the CSP offers for the current month, see the Partner Center [**Pricing workspace**](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/sales) page.

### Partner Center

The Partner Center dashboard will help you throughout your CSP journey:

- Manage **Account settings** for you and your users
- Download invoices and reconciliation files in the **Billing** workspace
- Connect with your **Customers**
- Explore **Incentives** programs offered by Microsoft
- Get valuable **Insights** on how to grow your business
- Discover and manage **Referrals**
- Get **Pricing** information on the products you want to sell
