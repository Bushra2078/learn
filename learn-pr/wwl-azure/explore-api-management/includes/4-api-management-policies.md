In Azure API Management, policies are a powerful capability of the system that allow the publisher to change the behavior of the API through configuration. Policies are a collection of Statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API.

Policies are applied inside the gateway which sits between the API consumer and the managed API. The gateway receives all requests and usually forwards them unaltered to the underlying API. However a policy can apply changes to both the inbound request and outbound response. Policy expressions can be used as attribute values or text values in any of the API Management policies, unless the policy specifies otherwise. 

## Understanding policy configuration

The policy definition is a simple XML document that describes a sequence of inbound and outbound statements. The XML can be edited directly in the definition window.

The configuration is divided into `inbound`, `backend`, `outbound`, and `on-error`. The series of specified policy statements is executes in order for a request and a response.

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the request go here -->
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <!-- statements to be applied before the request is forwarded to 
         the backend service go here -->
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the response go here -->
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <!-- statements to be applied if there is an error condition go here -->
  </on-error>
</policies>
```

If there is an error during the processing of a request, any remaining steps in the `inbound`, `backend`, or `outbound` sections are skipped and execution jumps to the statements in the `on-error` section. By placing policy statements in the `on-error` section you can review the error by using the `context.LastError` property, inspect and customize the error response using the `set-body` policy, and configure what happens if an error occurs.

## Examples

### Apply policies specified at different scopes

If you have a policy at the global level and a policy configured for an API, then whenever that particular API is used both policies will be applied. API Management allows for deterministic ordering of combined policy statements via the base element.

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <cross-domain />
        <base />
        <find-and-replace from="xyz" to="abc" />
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

In the example policy definition above, the `cross-domain` statement would execute before any higher policies which would in turn, be followed by the `find-and-replace` policy.

### Filter response content

The policy defined in example below demonstrates how to filter data elements from the response payload based on the product associated with the request.

The snippet assumes that response content is formatted as JSON and contains root-level properties named "minutely", "hourly", "daily", "flags".

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <base />
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <base />
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <base />
    <choose>
      <when condition="@(context.Response.StatusCode == 200 && context.Product.Name.Equals("Starter"))">
        <!-- NOTE that we are not using preserveContent=true when deserializing response body stream into a JSON object since we don't intend to access it again. See details on https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-transformation-policies#SetBody -->
        <set-body>
          @{
            var response = context.Response.Body.As<JObject>();
            foreach (var key in new [] {"minutely", "hourly", "daily", "flags"}) {
            response.Property (key).Remove ();
           }
          return response.ToString();
          }
    </set-body>
      </when>
    </choose>    
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <base />
  </on-error>
</policies>
```
