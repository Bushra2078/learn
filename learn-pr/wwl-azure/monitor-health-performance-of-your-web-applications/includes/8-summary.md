Migrating an application to the cloud is a first step towards building a durable, extensible solution for your users. After the migration, you'll want to take advantage of all the cloud has to offer by using available tools to monitor and improve performance. In this module, we looked at a few of the tools Azure has to offer to assist in this "run the business" activity.

In this module, you learned how to:

* Describe how Azure Monitor and Application Insights can help you track the performance of your app and resources
