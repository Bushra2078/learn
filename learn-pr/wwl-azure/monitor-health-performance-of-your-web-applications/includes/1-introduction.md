Once you've migrated or developed an application on Azure, you'll want to monitor the application's performance over time to ensure it's running at its best. This not only involves look at the app's metrics but also regularly looking at Azure services you can use to improve performance and usability. Being on the cloud means you're not locked into the infrastructure you started with. Continual improvement in existing services and the addition of new options is part of what can make the cloud better for you and your users.

In order to evaluate the opportunities for improvements, you have to examine how your existing app is performing. Azure provides robust tools to enable thorough insights into your application. In this module, we'll look at some of these tools and how you can use them to see how your app is performing, where there might be areas for improvement, and how you can debug your app to make it better.

The first tool we'll look at is Azure Monitor, the suite of utilities that can gather and display fine-grained detail on your application. Next, we'll explore Application Insights, an instrumentation utility that you can use to learn about specific functions of your app. Log analytics helps you monitor events to spot early signs of potential issues. Finally, Snapshot Debugger lets you work on code on your live application without disturbing the experience of your users.

Combined, these utilities can be used to ensure your migrated application is running at its best.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Describe how Azure Monitor and Application Insights can help you track the performance of your app and resources
* Perform log analysis by using Kusto queries
* Explain how Snapshot Debugger can help you discover issues in your app
