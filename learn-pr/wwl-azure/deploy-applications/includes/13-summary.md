This module explored the diverse approaches for deploying and updating organizational applications. When managing apps with Intune, it's crucial for administrators to grasp the app lifecycle. By defining the necessary requisites for the application, administrators can pick from a selection of deployment methods. Tools like Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Store can facilitate application delivery to devices. Additionally, Configuration Manager and Group Policy can be employed for domain-joined devices. Finally, administrators can use the Intune Management Extension to deploy applications to non-domain-joined devices.
