The Remote Desktop web client lets you use a compatible web browser to access your organization's remote resources (apps and desktops) published to you by your admin. You'll be able to interact with the remote apps and desktops like you would with a local PC no matter where you are, without having to use another desktop computer.

Once your admin sets up your remote resources all you need are your domain, user name, password, the URL your admin sent you, and web browser.

The web client doesn't currently have mobile OS support.

## Using the Remote Desktop client

To sign in to the client, go to the URL your admin sent you. At the sign in page, enter your domain and user name in the format `DOMAIN\username`, enter your password, and then select **Sign in**.

After you sign in, the client will take you to the **All Resources** tab, which contains all items published to you under one or more collapsible groups, such as the "Work Resources" group. You'll see several icons representing the apps, desktops, or folders containing more apps or desktops that the admin has made available to the work group. You can come back to this tab at any time to launch additional resources.

To start using an app or desktop, select the item you want to use, enter the same user name and password you used to sign in to the web client if prompted, and then select **Submit**.

You might also be shown a consent dialog to access local resources, like clipboard and printer. You can choose to not redirect either of these, or select **Allow** to use the default settings.

Wait for the web client to establish the connection, and then start using the resource as you would normally.
