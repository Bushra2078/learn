You can access Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 7 Enterprise desktops and apps at no extra cost if you have an eligible Windows or Microsoft 365 license.

Windows Server Remote Desktop Service is available at no cost if you have an eligible Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Client Access License (CAL).

Reserved Virtual Machine Instances are flexible and can be exchanged or returned.

Multi-session provides the greatest flexibility and cost savings by:

 -  Sharing the desktop infrastructure, preserving the state of your OS image by operating in a pooled environment.
 -  User data and settings retention.
 -  Accessed using FSLogix.

Personal desktops are typically chosen for the following reasons:

 -  Users needing administrative rights to modify the operating system and it retained after a virtual machine restart.
 -  Users running applications not compatible with multi-session.
