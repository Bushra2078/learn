What happens when your cloud starts to grow beyond just one subscription or environment? How can you scale the configuration of features? How can you enforce settings and policies in new subscriptions?

Azure Blueprints lets you standardize cloud subscription or environment deployments. Instead of having to configure features like Azure Policy for each new subscription, with Azure Blueprints you can define repeatable settings and policies that are applied as new subscriptions are created. Need a new test/dev environment? Azure Blueprints lets you deploy a new Test/Dev environment with security and compliance settings already configured. In this way, development teams can rapidly build and deploy new environments with the knowledge that they're building within organizational requirements.

## What are artifacts?

Each component in the blueprint definition is known as an artifact.

It is possible for artifacts to have no additional parameters (configurations). An example is the Deploy threat detection on SQL servers policy, which requires no additional configuration.

Artifacts can also contain one or more parameters that you can configure. The following screenshot shows the Allowed locations policy. This policy includes a parameter that specifies the allowed locations.

You can specify a parameter's value when you create the blueprint definition or when you assign the blueprint definition to a scope. In this way, you can maintain one standard blueprint but have the flexibility to specify the relevant configuration parameters at each scope where the definition is assigned.

Azure Blueprints deploy a new environment based on all of the requirements, settings, and configurations of the associated artifacts. Artifacts can include things such as:

 -  Role assignments
 -  Policy assignments
 -  Azure Resource Manager templates
 -  Resource groups

## How do Azure Blueprints help monitor deployments?

Azure Blueprints are version-able, allowing you to create an initial configuration and then make updates later on and assign a new version to the update. With versioning, you can make small updates and keep track of which deployments used which configuration set.

With Azure Blueprints, the relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was deployed) is preserved. In other words, Azure creates a record that associates a resource with the blueprint that defines it. This connection helps you track and audit your deployments.
