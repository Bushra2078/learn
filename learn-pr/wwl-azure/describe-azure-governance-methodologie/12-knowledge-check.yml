      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Policy can be used to enforce tagging values and rules on resources."
    - content: "Azure Service Health"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This service tracks the health of the Azure services, so you know if an Azure service is not working."
    - content: "Compliance Manager"
      isCorrect: false

    choices:
    - content: "Azure Blueprint"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Blueprints enable cloud architects to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implement and adhere to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Azure Blueprint enables development teams to rapidly build and deploy new environments with the knowledge that they're building within organizational compliance with a set of built-in components that speed up development and delivery."
    - content: "Azure Policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Policy is a single rule that is applied to all service or feature, versus applied to a set of resources."
    - content: "Azure Resource Groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Resource groups are a resource organization and management tool."
  - content: "Which of the following grants users only the rights they need to perform their jobs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  This is a way to assigning rules on specific Azure features and services."
    - content: "Compliance Manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This tool allows you to track your compliance to standards based on your business needs."
    - content: "Role-Based Access Control"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. RBAC grants users the specific rights they need to perform their jobs."
  - content: "Which of the following approaches would be the most efficient way to ensure a naming convention was followed across a subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Send out an email with the details of the naming conventions and hope it is followed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Emails are not a way to deploy and track a company standard."
    - content: "Create a policy with the naming requirements and assign it to the scope of the subscription"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct.  Using Azure Policy ensures that not only a naming standard recommended, but it is able to be reported on its adoption."
    - content: "Give all other users read-only access to the subscription. Have all requests to create resources sent back so the names can be reviewed while assigned to resources, and then create them."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  While this might work, it is convoluted and subject to many possible errors."
  - content: "Which of the following items would be good use of a resource lock?"
    choices:
    - content: "An ExpressRoute circuit with connectivity back to the on-premises network"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Protecting this mission critical resource from accidental deletion is a great idea."
    - content: "A non-production virtual machine used to test occasional application builds"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  This not a critical system that needs to be protected with locks."
    - content: "A storage account used to temporarily store images processed in a development environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  This is not a critical system that needs to be protected with locks."
