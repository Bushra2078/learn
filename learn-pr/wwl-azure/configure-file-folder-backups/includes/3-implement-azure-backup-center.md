Some of the key benefits of Backup Center include:

 -  **Single pane of glass to manage backups**. Backup Center is designed to function well across a large and distributed Azure environment. You can use Backup Center to efficiently manage backups spanning multiple workload types, vaults, subscriptions, regions, and tenants.
 -  **Datasource-centric management**. Backup Center provides views and filters that are centered on the datasources that you're backing up. Datasources like VMs and databases. This feature lets a resource owner or a backup admin to administer backup items across different vaults. The admin can also filter views by datasource-specific properties. These properties include datasource subscription, datasource resource group, and datasource tags.
 -  **Connected experiences**. Backup Center provides native integrations to existing Azure services that enable management at scale. For example, Backup Center uses the Azure Policy experience to help you govern your backups. It uses Azure workbooks and Azure Monitor Logs to help you view detailed reports on backups.
