Azure Backup for files and folders relies on the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent to be installed on the Window client or server.

The MARS agent is a full featured agent that has many features.

 -  Back up files and folders on physical or virtual Windows OS (VMs can be on-premises or in Azure).
 -  No separate backup server required.
 -  Not application aware; file, folder, and volume-level restore only.
 -  Back up and restore content.
