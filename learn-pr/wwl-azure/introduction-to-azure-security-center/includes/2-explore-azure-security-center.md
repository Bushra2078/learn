**Azure Security Center** is a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all your services both in Azure and on-premises. Security Center can:

 -  Provide security recommendations based on your configurations, resources, and networks.
 -  Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads and automatically apply required security to new services as they come online.
 -  Continuously monitor all your services and do automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
 -  Use Azure Machine Learning to detect and block malicious software from being installed on your virtual machines (VMs) and services. You can also define a list of allowed applications to ensure that only the validated apps can execute.
 -  Analyze and identify potential inbound attacks and help investigate threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
 -  Provide just-in-time (JIT) access control for ports by reducing your attack surface by ensuring the network only allows traffic that you require.

## Azure Security Center versions

Azure Security Center supports both Windows and Linux operating systems. It can also provide security to features in IaaS and platform as a service (PaaS) scenarios.

Azure Security Center is available in two versions:

 -  Free. Available as part of your Azure subscription, this tier is limited to assessments and Azure resources' recommendations only.
 -  Standard. This tier provides a full suite of security-related services, including continuous monitoring, threat detection, JIT access control for ports, and more.

To access the full suite of Azure Security Center services, you'll need to upgrade to a Standard version subscription.

You can access the 60-day free trial from within the Azure Security Center dashboard in the Azure portal.
