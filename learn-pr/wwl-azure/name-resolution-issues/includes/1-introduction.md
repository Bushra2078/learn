As an Azure network support engineer, you are responsible for ensuring that computers and devices on your network stay connected. Name resolution is the process of matching the name of a computer to its network address. If a name cannot be resolved, the computer will not be visible on the network, causing a breakdown in connectivity. Name resolution may be: 

- Public, using public Domain Name System (DNS) servers.

- Internal to Azure, using Azure infrastructure.

- On-premises, using your own DNS server.

You might also adopt a hybrid approach, using a combination of either private and public DNS, or on-premises and Azure DNS servers.

In this unit you will learn how to troubleshoot internal Azure name resolution issues and public DNS issues.
