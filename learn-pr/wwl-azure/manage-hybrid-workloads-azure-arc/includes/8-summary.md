It's become increasingly obvious that Contoso will need to continue to operate an on-premises environment for some time after they begin migrating workloads to Azure IaaS VMs. Consequently, having the ability to apply Azure policies to on-premises Windows Server workloads is proving to be important. In addition, administrators need be able to review on-premises Windows Server instances in the Azure console.

In this module, you learned about Azure Arc, including how to implement Azure Arc with on-premises server instances, how to deploy Azure policies with Azure Arc, and how to use RBAC to restrict access to Log Analytics data.

You and the IT Team at Contoso are now prepared to use Azure Arc to apply Azure Policy guest configuration to the company's on-premises Windows Server instances.
