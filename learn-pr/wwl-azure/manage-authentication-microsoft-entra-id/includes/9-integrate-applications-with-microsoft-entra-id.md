You can integrate your cloud-enabled software as service (SaaS) applications with Microsoft Entra ID. Refer to the Microsoft Entra ID Marketplace for a list of all SaaS apps that have been pre-integrated into Microsoft Entra ID. Use the application network portal to request a System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) enabled application to be added to the gallery for automatic provisioning or n SAML / OpenID Connect (OIDC) enabled application to be added to the gallery for SSO. Once you add the application from the gallery, configure and test Microsoft Entra ID SSO for the application.
