## Scenario

Managing virtual machines at scale can be challenging, especially when usage patterns vary and demands on applications fluctuate. You want to be able to adjust your virtual machine resources to match demands. At the same time, you want to keep the virtual machine configuration consistent to ensure application stability. Achieving these goals means you maintain throughput and responsiveness while minimizing the costs of continually running a large collection of virtual machines.

Your company website uses virtual machines and manages large workloads. The IT department wants to ensure the virtual machines can dynamically adjust to increases and decreases in workloads. They also want to ensure there is a business continuity plan to provide for highly available machines.

You need to deploy highly available virtual machines. You decide to use virtual machine scale sets and autoscale.
