Managing virtual machines at scale can be challenging, especially when usage patterns vary and demands on applications fluctuate. Azure Architects need to be able to adjust their virtual machine resources to match changing demands. At the same time, they need to keep their virtual machine configuration consistent to ensure application stability. Achieving these goals means maintaining throughput and responsiveness while minimizing the costs of continually running a large collection of virtual machines.

In this module, your company website uses virtual machines and manages large workloads. The IT department wants to ensure the virtual machines can dynamically adjust to increases and decreases in workloads. They also want to ensure there's a business continuity plan to provide for highly available machines. You're responsible for deploying highly available virtual machines. You've decided to use Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets and the autoscale feature.
