  questions:
  - content: "Another administrator creates an Azure virtual machine scale set with five virtual machines. Later, alerts show the VMs are all running at max capacity with the CPU being fully consumed. However, more VMs are not deploying in the scale set. What should be done to ensure that additional VMs are deployed when the CPU is 75% consumed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable the autoscale option."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When autoscale is enabled the parameters for when to scale are configured. To meet the requirements of this scenario, enable the autoscale option so that more VMs are created when the CPU is 75% consumed."
    - content: "Manually increase the instance count."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manually increases the instance count is time consuming and error prone. Is there a more automated way to do this?"
    - content: "Change the CPU percentage to 50%."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no need to change the CPU percentage requirement."
  - content: "The DevOps team for a large food delivery company is configuring a virtual machine scale set. Friday night is typically the busiest time. Conversely, 7 AM on Wednesday is generally the quietest time. Which of the following virtual machine scale set features should be configured to add more machines during that time?"
    choices:
    - content: "Autoscale"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscale will automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances that run the application. Is there a better solution based on demand?"
    - content: "Metric-based rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Metric-based rules are better for situations like CPU usage or storage disk capacity."
    - content: "Schedule-based rules"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With schedule-based rules administrators proactively schedule the scale set to deploy one or any number of additional instances. This will accommodate a spike in demand and then scale back down when the spike ends."
  - content: "Rather than deploy new instances as load increases on the application hosted in a virtual machine scale set, you want to increase the CPU capacity of each existing instance. Which of the following types of scaling would you perform to achieve this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Vertical scaling."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Vertical scaling increases the capacity of instances within a virtual machine scale set."
    - content: "Horizontal scaling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Horizontal scaling increases the number of instances within a virtual machine scale set."
    - content: "Load balancing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Load balancing distributes traffic across instances in a virtual machine scale set. It doesn't alter the number or performance of instances within the virtual machine scale sets."
