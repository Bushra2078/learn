  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Another IT administrator creates an Azure virtual machine scale set with five virtual machines (VMs). Later, alerts show the VMs are all running at max capacity with the CPU being fully consumed. However, additional VMs are not deploying in the scale set. What should be done to ensure that additional VMs are deployed when the CPU is 75% consumed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable the autoscale option."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. you can enable automatic scaling with the autoscale option. When you enable the option, you define the parameters for when to scale. To meet the requirements of this scenario, you need to enable the autoscale option so that additional VMs are created when the CPU is 75% consumed."
    - content: "Manually increase the instance count."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Can you think of a more automated way to do this?"
    - content: "Change the CPU percentage to 50%."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You do not need to change the CPU utilization metric."
  - content: "The DevOps team for a large food delivery company is configuring a virtual machine scale set. Friday night is typically your busiest time. Conversely, 7 AM on Wednesday is generally your quietest time. Which virtual machine scale set feature should you configure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Autoscale"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Autoscale will automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances that run your application. But, in this situation you want more control based on demand."
    - content: "Metric-based rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Metric-based rules are better for situations like CPU usage or storage disk capacity."
    - content: "Schedule-based rules"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. With schedule-based rules you can proactively schedule the scale set to deploy one or N number of additional instances. This will accommodate a spike in demand and then scale back down when the spike ends."
  - content: "Virtual machine scale sets deploy and manage ..."
    choices:
    - content: "a set of identical VM instances created from the same base OS image and configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This approach lets you easily manage hundreds of VMs without additional configuration tasks or network management."
    - content: "a mix of virtual machines with different OS images and configurations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Virtual machine scale sets deploy and manage a set of identical VM instances."
    - content: "whatever is needed for the application, an identical set or a mixed set of virtual machines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Virtual machine scale sets deploy and manage a set of identical VM instances."
