Security is an important factor in any solution and IoT brings its own special considerations with the addition of remote physical devices.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to ensure that the solution meets the company's security requirements. Understanding the threat landscape for an IoT solution and the approaches to mitigation will enable the team to develop their approach to security for IoT. You decide to examine IoT security recommendations and threat mitigation techniques.

In this module, you will:

 -  Review security recommendations.
 -  Examine the IoT security infrastructure and security-in-depth strategy.
 -  Examine threat modeling and mitigation techniques.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the Azure IoT solution security infrastructure, boundaries for threat modeling, and potential mitigations.
