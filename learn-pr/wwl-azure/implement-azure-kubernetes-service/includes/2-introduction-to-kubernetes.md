**Kubernetes** is a cluster orchestration technology that originated with Google. The Cloud-Native Computing Foundation currently owns it, and it's open source.

Kubernetes is often referred to a *k8s.* It's a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.

It creates a container-centric infrastructure.

There are several other container cluster orchestration technologies available such as [Mesosphere DC/OS](https://mesosphere.com/product/) and [Docker Swarm](https://www.docker.com/products/orchestration). Today though, all the industry interest appears to be in Kubernetes.

For more details about Kubernetes, go to [Production-Grade Container Orchestration](https://kubernetes.io/) on the Kubernetes website.
