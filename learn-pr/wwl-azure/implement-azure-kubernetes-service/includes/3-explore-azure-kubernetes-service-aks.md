AKS is Microsoft's implementation of Kubernetes. AKS makes it easier to deploy a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure.

It also reduces the complexity and operational overhead of Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure.

AKS manages much of the Kubernetes resources for the end user.

They do it making it quicker and easier to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise.

It also eliminates ongoing operations and maintenance burden by provisioning. And upgrading and scaling resources on demand without taking applications offline.

Azure AKS manages the following aspects of a Kubernetes cluster for you:

 -  It manages critical tasks, such as health monitoring and maintenance, Kubernetes version upgrades, and patching.
 -  It performs simple cluster scaling.
 -  It enables master nodes to be fully managed by Microsoft.
 -  It leaves you responsible only for managing and maintaining the agent nodes.
 -  It ensures master nodes are free, and you only pay for running agent nodes.

If you were manually deploying Kubernetes, you would need to pay for the resources for the master nodes.
