In this module, we'll talk about managing dependencies in software development. We're going to cover what dependencies are and how to identify them in your codebase.

Then you'll learn how to package these dependencies and manage the packages in package feeds. Finally, you're going to learn about versioning strategies.

We'll look at dependency management as a concept in software and why it's needed.

We're going to look at dependency management strategies and how you can identify components in your source code and change these to dependencies.
