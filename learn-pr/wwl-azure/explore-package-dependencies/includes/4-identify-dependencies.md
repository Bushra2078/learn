It starts with identifying the dependencies in your codebase and deciding which dependencies will be formalized.

Your software project and its solution probably already use dependencies.

It's common to use libraries and frameworks that are not written by yourself.

Additionally, your existing codebase might have internal dependencies that aren't treated as such.

For example, take a piece of code that implements a particular business domain model.

It might be included as source code in your project and consumed in other projects and teams.

It would help if you investigated your codebase to identify pieces of code that can be considered dependencies and treat them as such.

It requires changes to how you organize your code and build the solution. It will bring your components.
