**Network Watcher** provides tools to **monitor**, **diagnose**, view **metrics**, and enable or disable **logs** for resources in an Azure virtual network. Network Watcher is a regional service that enables you to monitor and diagnose conditions at a network scenario level.

 -  **Automate remote network monitoring with packet capture.** Monitor and diagnose networking issues without logging in to your virtual machines (VMs) using Network Watcher. Trigger packet capture by setting alerts, and gain access to real-time performance information at the packet level. When you observe an issue, you can investigate in detail for better diagnoses.
 -  **Gain insight into your network traffic using flow logs**. Build a deeper understanding of your network traffic pattern using Network Security Group flow logs. Information provided by flow logs helps you gather data for compliance, auditing and monitoring your network security profile.
 -  **Diagnose VPN connectivity issues**. Network Watcher provides you the ability to diagnose your most common VPN Gateway and Connections issues. Allowing you, not only, to identify the issue but also to use the detailed logs created to help further investigate.

**Verify IP Flow**: Quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment. For example, confirming if a security rule is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine. IP flow verify is ideal for making sure security rules are being correctly applied. When used for troubleshooting, if IP flow verify doesnâ€™t show a problem, you will need to explore other areas such as firewall restrictions.

**Next Hop**: To determine if traffic is being directed to the intended destination by showing the next hop. This will help determine if networking routing is correctly configured. Next hop also returns the route table associated with the next hop. If the route is defined as a user-defined route, that route is returned. Otherwise, next hop returns System Route. Depending on your situation the next hop could be Internet, Virtual Appliance, Virtual Network Gateway, VNet Local, VNet Peering, or None. None lets you know that while there may be a valid system route to the destination, there is no next hop to route the traffic to the destination. When you create a virtual network, Azure creates several default outbound routes for network traffic. The outbound traffic from all resources, such as VMs, deployed in a virtual network, are routed based on Azure's default routes. You might override Azure's default routes or create additional routes.

**VPN Diagnostics**: Troubleshoot gateways and connections. VPN Diagnostics returns a wealth of information. Summary information is available in the portal and more detailed information is provided in log files. The log files are stored in a storage account and include things like connection statistics, CPU and memory information, IKE security errors, packet drops, and buffers and events.

**NSG Flow Logs**: NSG Flow Logs maps IP traffic through a network security group. These capabilities can be used in security compliance and auditing. You can define a prescriptive set of security rules as a model for security governance in your organization. A periodic compliance audit can be implemented in a programmatic way by comparing the prescriptive rules with the effective rules for each of the VMs in your network.

**Connection Troubleshoot**. Azure Network Watcher Connection Troubleshoot is a more recent addition to the Network Watcher suite of networking tools and capabilities. Connection Troubleshoot enables you to troubleshoot network performance and connectivity issues in Azure.
