Suppose you have to troubleshoot a virtual network created by your colleagues. Unless you were involved in the creation process of the network, you might not know about all the aspects of the infrastructure. You can use the topology tool to visualize and understand the infrastructure you're dealing with before you start troubleshooting.

Network Watcher's Topology capability enables you to generate a visual diagram of the resources in a virtual network, and the relationships between the resources. The following picture shows an example topology diagram for a virtual network that has three subnets, two VMs, network interfaces, public IP addresses, network security groups, route tables, and the relationships between the resources:

The topology tool generates a graphical display of your Azure virtual network, its resources, its interconnections, and their relationships with each other.

> [!NOTE]
> To generate the topology, you need a Network Watcher instance in the same region as the virtual network.
