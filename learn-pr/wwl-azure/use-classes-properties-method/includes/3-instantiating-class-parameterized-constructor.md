A parameterized constructor simply means a constructor that takes parameters. If the class you're instantiating has a parameterized constructor, you can call the parameterized constructor by specifying values for the parameters when you instantiate the class.

## Instantiating with a Parameterized Constructor

Some classes accept parameters to their constructor methods, so that properties are set as soon as the object is instantiated. If the constructor method of the class accepts parameters, you pass those parameters to the constructor method when you instantiate the class.
```CSharp
myCustomer = new Customer("Sasha");
```
