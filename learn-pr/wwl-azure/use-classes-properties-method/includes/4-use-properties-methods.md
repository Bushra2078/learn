In programming you call constants (values that don't change), variables, methods, and properties the data members, or members, of a class. To access a public member on an instance, use the name of the instance, followed by a period, followed by the name of the member.

## Make properties do their job

To access a property, use the property name as if it were a public variable in the class. The compiler implicitly understands you want either the get accessor or the set accessor on the instance, depending on whether you're getting or setting the property value.

The following code sets the `name` property of the myCustomer object to “Customer name.” Setting the name of the property implicitly calls the `set` accessor. The next line of code *gets* (retrieves) the `name` text property, which implicitly calls the `get` accessor.

```csharp
myCustomer.name="Customer name";

return myCustomer.name ;
```

## Make methods do their job

To access a method, use parentheses after the name of the method. Within the parentheses, pass the values for any parameters required by the method. If the method is overloaded, the compiler uses the number and types of your parameters to determine which version of the overloaded method to invoke.
The following example calls the calcDiscount method that accepts no parameters and returns no values.

```csharp
myCustomer.calcDiscount();
```

The following example calls the calcDiscount method that passes back an integer value that specifies the customer discount:

```csharp
int dsct = myCustomer.calcDiscount();
```

>[!Note]
>Both methods and properties can be designed to accept reference types.

At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of to create an object that has properties and methods and how to use it in your code.
