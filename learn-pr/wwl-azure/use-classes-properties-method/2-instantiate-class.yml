    choices:
    - content: "Yes."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Yes, if the constructor is initialized."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In this example, an object has only been declared, but not instantiated. Therefore, the constructor cannot yet be initialized."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Declaring a class introduces a new variable to your application, but does not create it without instantiation unless it is static."
