quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Can a method call an object that is declared, but not instantiated yet?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A method can't be called until the object it belongs to is instantiated."
    - content: "Yes, if the constructor is initialized."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In this example, an object is only declared, but not instantiated. Therefore, the constructor can't yet be initialized."
    - content: "No."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Declaring a class introduces a new variable object to your application, but doesn't create it without instantiation, unless it's static."
