## Scenario

Containers offer a standardized and repeatable way to package, deploy and manage cloud applications. Azure Container Instances let you run a container in Azure without managing virtual machines and without a higher-level service.

You work for an online clothing retailer using containers for internal apps. These apps are hosted on-premises, in Azure, and in other cloud providers. The apps can share the hardware resources, but shouldn't access resources used by other apps.

The company relies on you to deploy, manage, size, and scale these containers.
