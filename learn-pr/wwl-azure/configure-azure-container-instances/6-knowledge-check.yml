  - content: "Which of the following is a reason to select virtual machines over containers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machines provide complete isolation from the host operating system and other VMs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Containers only provide lightweight isolation from the host and other containers, but don't provide as strong a security boundary as a virtual machine."
    - content: "Virtual machines run the user mode portion of an operating system and can be tailored to contain just the needed services for your app."
