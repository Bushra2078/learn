    - content: "Container groups expose a single private IP address, with one exposed port."

      explanation: "That's incorrect. Container groups exposes a single public IP address, with one exposed port."
    - content: "Container groups are scheduled on a single host machine."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Container groups are scheduled on a single host machine."
  - content: "Which of the following is a reason to select virtual machines over containers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machines provide complete isolation from the host operating system and other VMs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Containers only provide lightweight isolation from the host and other containers, but don't provide as strong a security boundary as a virtual machine."
    - content: "Virtual machines run the user mode portion of an operating system and can be tailored to contain just the needed services for the app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Virtual machines run a complete operating system including the kernel."
    - content: "Virtual machines use Azure Disks for local storage for a single node."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Virtual machines use a virtual hard disk (VHD) for local storage for a single VM."

    - content: "Containers require several minutes to load."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Containers launch in seconds and that is an advantage over virtual machines."
    - content: "Containers use Azure blobs for retrieve and persist state."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Containers use Azure file shares to retrieve and persist state."
