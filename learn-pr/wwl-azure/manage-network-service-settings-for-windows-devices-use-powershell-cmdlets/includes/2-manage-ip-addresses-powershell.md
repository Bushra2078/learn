PowerShell includes the **NETTCPIP** module, which consists of TCP/IP-specific cmdlets used to manage network settings for Windows servers and devices. You can use the **NETTCPIP** cmdlets to add, remove, change, and validate IP address settings.

IP address management cmdlets use the noun "NetIPAddress" in their names. You can also find them by using the **Get-Command** command with the *-Module NetTCPIP* parameter.

The following table lists common cmdlets for managing IP address settings.

*Table 1: Cmdlets for managing IP address settings*

| Cmdlet                  | Description                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **New-NetIPAddress**    | Creates a new IP address             |
| **Get-NetIPAddress**    | Displays properties of an IP address |
| **Set-NetIPAddress**    | Modifies properties of an IP address |
| **Remove-NetIPAddress** | Deletes an IP address                |

## Creating new IP address settings

The **New-NetIPAddress** cmdlet requires an IPv4 or IPv6 address and either the alias or index of a network interface. As a best practice, you should also set the default gateway and subnet mask at the same time.

The following table lists common parameters for the **New-NetIPAddress** cmdlet.

*Table 2: Parameters for New-NetIPAddress*

| Parameter               | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -IPAddress      | Defines the IPv4 or IPv6 address to create                   |
| -InterfaceIndex | Defines the network interface, by index, for the IP address  |
| -InterfaceAlias | Defines the network interface, by name, for the IP address   |
| -DefaultGateway | Defines the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the default gateway host |
| -PrefixLength   | Defines the subnet mask for the IP address                   |

The following command creates a new IP address on the Ethernet interface:

```powershell
New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.1.10 -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -PrefixLength 24 -DefaultGateway 192.168.1.1
```

The **New-NetIPAddress** cmdlet also accepts the *â€“AddressFamily* parameter, which defines either the IPv4 or IPv6 IP address family. If you don't use this parameter, the address family property is detected automatically.
