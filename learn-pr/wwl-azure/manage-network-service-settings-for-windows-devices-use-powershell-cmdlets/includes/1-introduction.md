Both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core support cmdlets that you can use to manage all aspects related to network settings on Windows devices. Settings that you can configure with PowerShell include TCP/IP, Domain Name System (DNS), firewall, and routing table configurations. In addition to the cmdlets for managing network features and components, the **Test-NetConnection** cmdlet is also available. This cmdlet offers the same functionality as traditional command-line interface tools such as **ping.exe** and **tracert.exe**, which are used to identify and diagnose network connectivity and configuration settings.

In this module, you'll learn about the PowerShell modules and cmdlets used for configuring network settings for Windows devices.
