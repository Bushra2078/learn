There are three primary tools that you will use to manage IoT devices.

## IoT Hub (Azure portal)

The Azure portal can be used to implement device management in the following ways:

 -  Update Device Twin properties and tags for a device.
 -  Invoke a Direct Method on a device.
 -  Implement Automatic Device Management.

## Azure CLI

Azure CLI and the Azure CLI extension for IoT commands can be used to implement device management in the following ways:

 -  Update Device Twin properties and tags for a device.
 -  Invoke a Direct Method on a device.
 -  Perform Device Twin queries across devices.

## VS Code

Visual Studio Code and the Azure IoT Tools extension can be used to implement device management in the following ways:

 -  Create device code (such as direct methods or code used to help manage devices using device twin properties) using the Azure IoT Hub Device SDK.
 -  Create backend apps (to support specific management tasks and jobs that support management at scale) using the Azure IoT Hub Service SDK.
