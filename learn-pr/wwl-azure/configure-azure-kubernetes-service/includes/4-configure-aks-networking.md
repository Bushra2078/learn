To allow access to your applications, or for application components to communicate with each other, Kubernetes provides an abstraction layer to virtual networking. Kubernetes nodes are connected to a virtual network, and can provide inbound and outbound connectivity for pods. The *kube-proxy* component runs on each node to provide these network features.

In Kubernetes, Services logically group pods to allow for direct access via an IP address or DNS name and on a specific port. You can also distribute traffic using a load balancer. More complex routing of application traffic can also be achieved with Ingress Controllers. Security and filtering of the network traffic for pods is possible with Kubernetes network policies.

The Azure platform also helps to simplify virtual networking for AKS clusters. When you create a Kubernetes load balancer, the underlying Azure load balancer resource is created and configured. As you open network ports to pods, the corresponding Azure network security group rules are configured. For HTTP application routing, Azure can also configure external DNS as new ingress routes are configured.

## Services

To simplify the network configuration for application workloads, Kubernetes uses Services to logically group a set of pods together and provide network connectivity. The following Service types are available:

 -  **Cluster IP** \- Creates an internal IP address for use within the AKS cluster. Good for internal-only applications that support other workloads within the cluster. :::image type="content" source="../media/AZ104_AKS_Clusterip-949b83c8.png" alt-text="Diagram showing Cluster IP traffic flow in an AKS cluster.":::
    
 -  **NodePort** \- Creates a port mapping on the underlying node that allows the application to be accessed directly with the node IP address and port. :::image type="content" source="../media/AZ104_AKS_Nodeport-69acb55c.png" alt-text="Diagram showing NodePort traffic flow in an AKS cluster.":::
    
 -  **LoadBalancer** \- Creates an Azure load balancer resource, configures an external IP address, and connects the requested pods to the load balancer backend pool. To allow customers traffic to reach the application, load-balancing rules are created on the desired ports. :::image type="content" source="../media/AZ104_AKS_LB-a89f8344.png" alt-text="Diagram showing Load Balancer traffic flow in an AKS cluster.":::
     For additional control and routing of the inbound traffic, you may instead use an Ingress controller.
 -  **ExternalName** \- Creates a specific DNS entry for easier application access.

The IP address for load balancers and services can be dynamically assigned, or you can specify an existing static IP address to use. Both internal and external static IP addresses can be assigned. This existing static IP address is often tied to a DNS entry.

Both *internal* and *external* load balancers can be created. Internal load balancers are only assigned a private IP address, so can't be accessed from the Internet.

## Pods

Kubernetes uses pods to run an instance of your application. A pod represents a single instance of your application. Pods typically have a 1:1 mapping with a container, although there are advanced scenarios where a pod might contain multiple containers. These multi-container pods are scheduled together on the same node, and allow containers to share related resources.

When you create a pod, you can define resource limits to request a certain amount of CPU or memory resources. The Kubernetes Scheduler attempts to schedule the pods to run on a node with available resources to meet the request. You can also specify maximum resource limits that prevent a given pod from consuming too much compute resource from the underlying node.

> [!NOTE]
> A best practice is to include resource limits for all pods to help the Kubernetes Scheduler understand what resources are needed and permitted.

A pod is a logical resource, but the container (or containers) is where the application workloads run. Pods are typically ephemeral, disposable resources. Therefore, individually scheduled pods miss some of the high availability and redundancy features Kubernetes provides. Instead, pods are usually deployed and managed by Kubernetes controllers, such as the Deployment controller.
