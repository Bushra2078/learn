Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) is recommended when you need full container organization. AKS includes discovery across multiple containers, automatic scaling, and coordinated application upgrades.

In this module, you learned how to identify AKS components including pods, clusters, and nodes. You explored how to configure network connections and storage options for AKS, and how to implement security options. You discovered how to scale AKS including by adding Azure Container Instances.
