## Scenario

The standard container management runtime focuses on managing individual containers. If you want to scale a complex system with multiple containers working together, this scenario becomes challenging. To make the management process easier, it's common to use a container management platform, such as Kubernetes.

Suppose you work at a fleet management company. Your company provides an asset tracking solution to customers worldwide. Your tracking solution is built and deployed as microservices. You're using containerized instances to quickly deploy into new customer regions and scale resources as needed to meet customer demands. The company plans to use AKS to deploy, and manage containerized applications.

You need to manage storage, scaling, network connections, and upgrades for the AKS solution.
