  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How does one access a class that is in another namespace?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provide a link to the other namespace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You don't create links to other namespaces to access them."
    - content: "You don't need to do anything, namespaces are global and their contents are available everywhere."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is incorrect, as namespaces aren't global."
    - content: "Prefix your object with the name of the namespace it belongs to."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The way you access objects in another namespace is prefix the name of your object with the name of the class that belongs to it."
  - content: "Why do two classes share the same namespace?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because they do the same thing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. No two classes should do the exact same thing and this wouldn't be a reason to put them in the same namespace."
    - content: "Because they are of the same type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classes of the same name/type are put in different namespaces to avoid name conflicts."
    - content: "Because they perform related functionality."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Namespaces group classes that have related functionality and avoid name conflicts."
