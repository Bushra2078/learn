quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the reason for having multiple constructor methods in your class?"
    choices:
    - content: "Multiple constructors are never needed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is untrue, at some point objects may need multiple constructors."
    - content: "To make your code more readable."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Having multiple constructors isn't done to make your code more readable."
    - content: "To initialize your object for different purposes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! As constructors are used to initialize an object, having an overloaded constructor allows your objects to be initialized for different use cases."
  - content: "Which of these scenarios is a good reason to possibly add a second (overloaded) constructor?"
    choices:
    - content: "To have more than one way to create your object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although partially correct, this answer is too vague and doesn't provide any reasoning for the answer given."
    - content: "When the main constructor no longer works."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Constructors aren't added to a class as backup for another constructor."
    - content: "To have an option to initialize your object with limited basic information, and an option for initializing it with a full set of information."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! While there can be various reasons for having more than one constructor, this is a good answer for this scenario."
