## Introduction
This module starts you off on your journey of understanding and working with classes, perhaps the most basic and important building block of an object oriented application.

Suppose you want to build a house. How would you go about it? You might start with a design and develop a blueprint from that design that lays out the framing of the rooms, the plumbing and wiring for the house, etcetera. After the design is in place, you would then begin constructing your house. Programming isn't much different.

You start by thinking about what you want to build, then plan the design and build out from there. In object-oriented programming you do the same thing. You think about the program you want to build, then identify the classes/objects that it will consist of. This process of identifying the classes/objects that your program consists of is often referred to as abstraction. Abstraction is the idea of taking what you want to build and then abstracting it out into classes that represent the various pieces of your application. 

>[!NOTE]
>Classes are the design or blueprint for an object. Objects are the “live” embodiment, so to speak, of that class in your computers Random Access Memory or RAM. They're the blueprint for what we call the “in-memory” object that actually does what the class blueprint or design has specified.

To tell it another way, each object represents a class. The class is the building block of an object-oriented application. And, in order to use a class in a completed application, you must create an object based on the class, as it's the live, in-memory, representation of that class.
The purpose of this lesson is to differentiate between a class and an object, and to create a class. This module explains the differences between a class and an object, and shows you how to create a class.

After completing this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Describe a class.
- Differentiate between a class and an object
- Describe the life cycle of a class
- Organize classes into groups using namespaces
