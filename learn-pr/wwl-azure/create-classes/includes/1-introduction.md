## Introduction

This module starts you off on your journey of understanding and working with classes, perhaps the most basic and important building block of an object oriented application. They're a blueprint of sorts for objects you create.

Suppose you as a programmer want to build an application that designs a home. How would you go about it? You might start off with a house class. Your house class holds other objects such as rooms, floors, etcetera. You begin your journey discovering classes by planning and developing such an application.

After completing this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Describe a class
- Differentiate between a class and an object
- Describe the life cycle of a class
- Organize classes into groups using namespaces
- I am here
