## Summary

Your goal was to learn about the differences between a class and an object and how a class is the blueprint for an object. You then went on to learn about encapsulation (or data hiding in a class) and an object's lifecycle. The term lifecycle refers to the allocation and deallocation of memory for an object. You learned about constructors and that they're used to initialize values in an object. Finally, you learned that namespaces are used to organize your classes into groups to avoid collisions of resources that may have the same name.

These introductory concepts provide you with the basic understanding required to move forward in your journey.
