quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the difference between memory allocation/de-allocation and instantiation?"
    choices:
    - content: "They're the same."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although related, the allocation/de-allocation of memory and instantiation are not the same."
    - content: "Instantiation occurs before allocation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The allocation of memory occurs when you \"new\" or instantiate your objects."
    - content: "Allocation/de-allocation has to do with memory management for your objects and instantiation is about actually creating the objects."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A roof is something that all houses have and would be appropriate for a house class to have."
  - content: "What is garbage collection?"
    choices:
    - content: "A process of removing system level resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Garbage collection has nothing to do with system resources, but with the freeing up of user defined objects in memory."
    - content: "When the garbage man collects the garbage at my home."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although certainly the form of garbage collection we are most used to, it does not apply to computer programming."
    - content: "Automatic Memory Management."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Garbage collection is the automatic deallocation of objects in memory when they're no longer being used."
