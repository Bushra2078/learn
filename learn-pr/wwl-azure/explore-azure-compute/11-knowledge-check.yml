  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following categories of Azure virtual machine provides the fastest and most powerful CPU? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "General purpose"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "Compute optimized"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "High performance compute"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. High performance compute VMs (including the H size) provide the fastest and most powerful CPU Azure VMs with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA)."
  - content: "Which of the following categories of Azure virtual machine is ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and large transactional databases? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "GPU"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "Storage optimized"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Storage optimized VMs (including the Lsv2 and Ls sizes) provide high disk throughput and IO, ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and large transactional databases."
    - content: "Memory optimized"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
  - content: "What is the advantage of using a constrained vCPU virtual machine for a workload that does not require a high core count? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "It increases the I/O bandwidth"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "It has higher RAM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "It has lower licensing fees"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The licensing fees charged for SQL Server or Oracle are constrained to the vCPU count, and other products should be charged based on the new vCPU count. A constrained vCPU VM shares the same specs for memory, storage, and I/O bandwidth as the original VM, but with a lower licensing cost."
  - content: "How many total network data flows does the Azure networking stack support with good performance, for VMs with 8 CPU cores or more?"
    choices:
    - content: "100,000"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "250,000"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure networking stack supports 250 K total network flows with good performance for VMs with 8 CPU cores or more and 100 K total flows with good performance for VMs with less than 8 CPU cores. Past this limit network performance degrades gracefully for additional flows up to a hard limit of 1 M total flows, 500 K inbound and 500 K outbound, after which additional flows are dropped."
    - content: "1,000,000"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
