  - content: "Your company is in the process of deploying 700 devices when their plans change. Device enrollments have already been completed for all 700 devices. There are 500 devices that have been provisioned, but those devices must be moved to a different IoT Hub. The other 200 devices will not be provisioned due to a change in business requirements. Which of the following answer choices describes the initial actions that must be taken?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This solution does not take any steps toward moving the 500 already-provisioned devices to another IoT hub. This solution leaves the 500 devices enrolled to the wrong IoT hub."
    - content: "Disenroll and deregister all 700 devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You cannot deregister devices that have not been provisioned. There are 200 devices have not been provisioned. These 200 devices cannot be deregistered."
    - content: "Disenroll all 700 devices. Deregister the 500 provisioned devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This solution takes the step to correct enrollment and removes the devices that are registered to the wrong IoT hub."
