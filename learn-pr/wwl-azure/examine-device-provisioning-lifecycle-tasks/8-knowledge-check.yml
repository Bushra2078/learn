  - content: "Your company is in the process of deploying 700 devices when their plans change. Device enrollments have already been completed for all 700 devices. There are 500 devices that have been provisioned, but that must be moved to a different IoT Hub. The other 200 devices will not be provisioned. Which of the following statements is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "You should disenroll the devices that have not been provisioned and leave the other enrollments unchanged."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This solution does not take any steps toward moving the 500 already provisioned devices to another IoT hub and leaves them enrolled to the wrong IoT hub."
    - content: "You should disenroll and deregister all 700 devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 200 devices that have not been provisioned cannot be deregistered because they have not been registered yet."
    - content: "You should disenroll all 700 devices and deregister the 500 provisioned devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This solution takes the step to correct enrollment and removes the devices that are registered to the wrong IoT hub."
