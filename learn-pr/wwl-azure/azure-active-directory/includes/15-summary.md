Azure AD helps you give access to your organization's resources by providing access rights to a single user, to an entire Azure AD group, or to specific administrative units.

You should now be able to:

 -  Compare and contrast Azure AD versus on-premises directory services with Azure AD Domain Services.
 -  Configure and deploy users, groups, and administrative units to securely access resources in your tenant.
 -  Deploy a passwordless login solution for your Azure users and resources.
