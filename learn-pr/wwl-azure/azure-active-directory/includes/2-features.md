**Microsoft Entra ID** (Microsoft Entra ID) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. This service helps employees access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Microsoft Entra ID also helps them access internal resources like apps on your corporate intranet network, along with any cloud apps developed for your organization.

Microsoft Entra ID is intended for:

 -  IT admins: As an IT admin, use Microsoft Entra ID to control access to your apps and your app resources based on your business requirements. For example, you can use Microsoft Entra ID to require multi-factor authentication when accessing important organizational resources. You can also use Microsoft Entra ID to automate user provisioning between your existing Windows Server AD and your cloud apps, including Microsoft 365. Finally, Microsoft Entra ID gives you powerful tools to automatically help protect user identities and credentials and to meet your access governance requirements.
 -  App developers: As an app developer, you can use Microsoft Entra ID as a standards-based approach for adding single sign-on (SSO) to your app, allowing it to work with a user's pre-existing credentials. Microsoft Entra ID also provides APIs that can help you build personalized app experiences using existing organizational data.
 -  Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics Customer relationship management (CRM) Online subscribers: As a subscriber, you're already using Microsoft Entra ID. Each Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online tenant is automatically a Microsoft Entra tenant. You can immediately start to manage access to your integrated cloud apps.

 -  **Microsoft Entra ID P2.** In addition to the Free and P1 features, P2 also offers Microsoft Entra ID Protection to help provide risk-based Conditional Access to your apps and critical company data and Privileged Identity Management to help discover, restrict, and monitor administrators and their access to resources and to provide just-in-time access when needed.
