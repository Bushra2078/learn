In this module, we focused on configuring and integrating a log analytics agent and workspace in Defender for Cloud in the Azure portal. We learned how to deploy and configure the agent on virtual machines and enable the necessary diagnostic settings. By creating a Log Analytics workspace and connecting it with the agent, we established a centralized location for storing and analyzing log data. This integration enables effective monitoring, threat detection, and incident response capabilities within Defender for Cloud, providing valuable insights into the security posture of our Azure environment.
