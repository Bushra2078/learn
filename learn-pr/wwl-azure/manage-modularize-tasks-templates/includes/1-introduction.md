This module describes the creation of task and variable groups, creating custom build and release tasks, and using release variables and stage variables in your pipeline.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, students and professionals can:

 -  Use and manage task and variable groups.
 -  Use release variables and stage variables in your release pipeline.
 -  Use variables in release pipelines.
 -  Create custom build and release tasks.

## Prerequisites

 -  Understanding of what DevOps is and its concepts.
 -  Familiarity with version control principles is helpful but isn't necessary.
 -  Beneficial to have experience in an organization that delivers software.
 -  For some exercises, you need to create an Azure DevOps Organization and a Team Project. If you don't have it yet, see: [Create an organization - Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
     -  If you already have your organization created, use the [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/) and create a new Team Project called "Parts Unlimited" using the template "PartsUnlimited." Or feel free to create a blank project. See [Create a project - Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project).
