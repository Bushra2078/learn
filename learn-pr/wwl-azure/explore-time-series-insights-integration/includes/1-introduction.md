Azure Time Series Insights can be configured within your IoT solution and used to visualize IoT device telemetry.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to support the implementation of Azure Time Series Insights within the solution. You decide to gain experience by implementing Time Series Insights in a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:

 -  Create an Azure Time Series Insights (TSI) environment.
 -  Connect to IoT Hub with Time Series Insights (TSI).
 -  View time series data using the Time Series Insights (TSI) Explorer.

By the end of this module, you will be able to analyze IoT telemetry data using Azure Time Series Insights.
