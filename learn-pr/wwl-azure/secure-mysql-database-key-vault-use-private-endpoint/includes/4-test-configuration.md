As the final step of this exercise, you should once again test your setup. You should still be able to navigate to your application through the custom domain that you configured on your Application Gateway and view the listing of `owners`and `veterinarians`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see any data when navigating the menu options in the application, try redeploying the `customers`, `visits`and `vets`apps again to Azure Spring Apps.
