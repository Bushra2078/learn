The Azure IoT Edge environment provides enhanced device and data management capabilities that must be communicated during the IoT Edge device deployment process.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to implement key portions of the solution directly on devices using Azure IoT Edge technologies. Understanding the IoT Edge device deployment process will help to ensure that you are prepared for the upcoming implementation tasks. You decide to examine the process and feature requirements associated with IoT Edge device deployment.<br>

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine Azure IoT Edge deployment concepts.
 -  Examine the IoT Edge deployment manifest.
 -  Examine pre-deployment considerations.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the tools and processes that are used to deploy IoT Edge devices.
