IT staff at Contoso want to use Defender for Cloud to help secure their VM workloads and their on-premises servers. To onboard their VMs and on-premises servers to Defender for Cloud, they must complete the following tasks:

- Enable the Standard pricing tier
- Enable automatic provisioning
- Onboard their VMs and servers

> [!NOTE]
> Standard pricing must be enabled for Defender for Cloud and any associated Log Analytics workspaces.

## Enable the Defender for Cloud Standard pricing tier

To use Defender for Cloud advanced capabilities or to use it with on-premises servers, you'll need to enable the Defender for Cloud Standard pricing tier in your Azure subscriptions. Subscriptions that aren't upgraded to the Standard pricing tier are listed in the workload protection dashboard. If you already have a default **Log Analytics** workspace, you'll also need to upgrade it to the Standard pricing tier.

To switch to Standard tier pricing, use the following procedure:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Defender for Cloud**.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Pricing & settings**.
3. In the details pane, select your subscription.
4. Select **Standard**, and then select **Save**.
5. If necessary, repeat these steps for any Log Analytics workspaces you want to use with Defender for Cloud.

## Enable automatic provisioning

If you enable automatic provisioning, Defender for Cloud installs the Log Analytics agent on your existing Azure VMs and on any Azure VMs that you create in the future. When you enable automatic provisioning, you choose to store data either in the default Log Analytics workspace that Defender for Cloud creates, or in an existing workspace. If no workspaces display, create a new one or upgrade an existing one.

To enable automatic provisioning, use the following procedure:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Defender for Cloud**.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Pricing & settings**.
3. In the details pane, select your subscription, and then in the navigation pane, select **Data Collection**.
4. In the details pane, under **Auto Provisioning**, select **On**. You can also select the preferred Log Analytics workspace under the **Workspace configuration** heading.
5. Select **Save**.

## Onboard your on-premises servers and computers

After upgrading Defender for Cloud to the Standard tier for your subscriptions, you can onboard your on-premises computers. This requires that you download the Log Analytics agent and install it on the computers. Use the following procedure to install the required agents:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Defender for Cloud**.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Getting started**.
3. In the details pane, select the **Install Agents** tab. Agents should be installed on your VMs already, and so the **Install agents** button is greyed out and unavailable.
4. Select the **Get Started** tab.
5. In the details pane, beneath the **Add non-Azure servers** heading, select **Configure**.
6. On the **Onboard servers to Defender for Cloud** blade, if necessary, select **Create New Workspace**.
7. Create a new Log Analytics workspace.
8. Select **+ Add Servers** in the selected workspace.

9. On the **Agents management** blade, select the appropriate link for the agent you require. Typically, you will select **Download Windows Agent (64 bit)**.
10. Copy the **Workspace ID** and **Primary key**. You'll need those to install the agent.

11. Copy the downloaded agent to your on-premises servers.
12. Run the **MMASetup-AMD64.exe** file to install the agent.
13. When prompted, in the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent Setup wizard** on the **Azure Setup Options** page, select the **Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS) check box**, and then select **Next**.
