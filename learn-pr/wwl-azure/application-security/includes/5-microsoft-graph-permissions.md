Microsoft Graph exposes granular permissions that control the access that apps have to resources, like users, groups, and mail. As a developer, you decide which permissions to request for Microsoft Graph. When a user signs in to your app they, or, in some cases, an administrator, are given a chance to consent to these permissions. If the user consents, your app is given access to the resources and APIs that it has requested. For apps that don't take a signed-in user, permissions can be pre-consented to by an administrator when the app is installed.

Microsoft Graph has two types of permissions:
* **Delegated permissions** are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests and the app can act as the signed-in user when making calls to Microsoft Graph. Some delegated permissions can be consented by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.
* **Application permissions** are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present; for example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Application permissions can only be consented by an administrator.

Effective permissions are the permissions that your app will have when making requests to Microsoft Graph. It is important to understand the difference between the delegated and application permissions that your app is granted and its effective permissions when making calls to Microsoft Graph.

For delegated permissions, the effective permissions of your app will be the intersection of the delegated permissions the app has been granted (via consent) and the privileges of the currently signed-in user. Your app can never have more privileges than the signed-in user. Within organizations, the privileges of the signed-in user can be determined by policy or by membership in one or more administrator roles. 

For example, assume your app has been granted the User.ReadWrite.All delegated permission. This permission nominally grants your app permission to read and update the profile of every user in an organization. If the signed-in user is a global administrator, your app will be able to update the profile of every user in the organization. However, if the signed-in user is not in an administrator role, your app will be able to update only the profile of the signed-in user. It will not be able to update the profiles of other users in the organization because the user that it has permission to act on behalf of does not have those privileges.
For application permissions, the effective permissions of your app will be the full level of privileges implied by the permission. For example, an app that has the User.ReadWrite.All application permission can update the profile of every user in the organization.

## Microsoft Graph API

You can use the Microsoft Graph Security API to connect Microsoft security products, services, and partners to streamline security operations and improve threat protection, detection, and response capabilities. The Microsoft Graph Security API is an intermediary service (or broker) that provides a single programmatic interface to connect multiple Microsoft Graph Security providers (also called security providers or providers).
The Microsoft Graph Security API federates requests to all providers in the Microsoft Graph Security ecosystem. This is based on the security provider consent provided by the application, as shown in the following diagram. The consent workflow only applies to non-Microsoft providers.

The following is a description of the flow:

1. The application user signs in to the provider application to view the consent form from the provider. This consent form experience or UI is owned by the provider and applies to non-Microsoft providers only to get explicit consent from their customers to send requests to Microsoft Graph Security API.
1. The client consent is stored on the provider side.
1. The provider consent service calls the Microsoft Graph Security API to inform consent approval for the respective customer.
1. The application sends a request to the Microsoft Graph Security API.
1. The Microsoft Graph Security API checks for the consent information for this customer mapped to various providers.
1. The Microsoft Graph Security API calls all those providers the customer has given explicit consent to via the provider consent experience.
1. The response is returned from all the consented providers for that client.
1. The result set response is returned to the application.
1. If the customer has not consented to any provider, no results from those providers are included in the response.

The Microsoft Graph Security API makes it easy to connect with security solutions from Microsoft and partners. It allows you to more readily realize and enrich the value of these solutions. You can connect easily with the Microsoft Graph Security API by using one of the following approaches, depending on your requirements:

### Why use the Microsoft Graph Security API?
- Write code – Find code samples in C#, Java, NodeJS, and more.
- Connect using scripts – Find PowerShell samples.
- Drag and drop into workflows and playbooks – Use Microsoft Graph Security connectors for Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Flow, and PowerApps.
- Get data into reports and dashboards – Use the Microsoft Graph Security connector for Power BI.
- Connect using Jupyter notebooks – Find Jupyter notebook samples.

#### Unify and standardize alert tracking

Connect once to integrate alerts from any Microsoft Graph-integrated security solution and keep alert status and assignments in sync across all solutions. You can also stream alerts to security information and event management (SIEM) solutions, such as Splunk using Microsoft Graph Security API connectors.

#### Correlate security alerts to improve threat protection and response

Correlate alerts across security solutions more easily with a unified alert schema. This not only allows you to receive actionable alert information but allows security analysts to pivot and enrich alerts with asset and user information, enabling faster response to threats and asset protection.

#### Update alert tags, status, and assignments

Tag alerts with additional context or threat intelligence to inform response and remediation. Ensure that comments and feedback on alerts are captured for visibility to all workflows. Keep alert status and assignments in sync so that all integrated solutions reflect the current state. Use webhook subscriptions to get notified of changes.

#### Unlock security context to drive investigation

Dive deep into related security-relevant inventory (like users, hosts, and apps), then add organizational context from other Microsoft Graph providers (Azure AD, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft 365) to bring business and security contexts together and improve threat response.
