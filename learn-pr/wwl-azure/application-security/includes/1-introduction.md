Application security is one extra layer in the defense-in-depth strategy. You ensure that your application is registered, so it has a unique identity in Microsoft Entra ID, then you can manage and control both access to the application and what the application can do.

## Scenario

 -  Register applications with Microsoft Entra ID.
 -  Assign permissions for the application and the users to access it.
 -  Use certificates and secrets to protect operations and data.

## Skills measured

Locking down applications and data is a part of [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer](/certifications/exams/az-500).
