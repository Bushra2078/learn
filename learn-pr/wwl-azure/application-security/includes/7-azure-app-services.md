***Azure App Service*** is an HTTP-based service for **hosting web applications**, **REST APIs**, and **mobile backends**. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

App Service not only adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. You can also use its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.

With App Service, you pay for the Azure compute resources you use. The compute resources you use are determined by the App Service plan that you run your apps on. For more information, see Azure App Service plans overview.

## Why use App Service?

Azure App Service is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) offering for developers. Here are some key features of App Service:

 -  Multiple languages and frameworks - App Service has first-class support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can also run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services.
 -  Managed production environment - App Service automatically patches and maintains the OS and language frameworks for you. Spend time writing great apps and let Azure worry about the platform.
 -  Containerization and Docker - Dockerize your app and host a custom Windows or Linux container in App Service. Run multi-container apps with Docker Compose. Migrate your Docker skills directly to App Service.
 -  DevOps optimization - Set up continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry. Promote updates through test and staging environments. Manage your apps in App Service by using Azure PowerShell or the cross-platform command-line interface (CLI).
 -  Global scale with high availability - Scale up or out manually or automatically. Host your apps anywhere in Microsoft's global data center infrastructure, and the App Service SLA promises high availability.
 -  Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data - Choose from more than 50 connectors for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). Access on-premises data using Hybrid Connections and Azure Virtual Networks.
 -  Security and compliance - The App Service is ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant. Authenticate users with Microsoft Entra ID, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Microsoft account. Create IP address restrictions and manage service identities. Prevent subdomain takeovers.
 -  Application templates - Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
 -  Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code integration - Dedicated tools in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.
 -  API and mobile features - App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios and simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.
 -  Serverless code - Run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure and pay only for the compute time your code actually uses.

Besides App Service, Azure offers other services that can be used for hosting websites and web applications. For most scenarios, App Service is the best choice.
