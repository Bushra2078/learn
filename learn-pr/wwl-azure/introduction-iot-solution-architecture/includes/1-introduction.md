A solution architecture describes the components of the solution and how they work together.

Suppose you are working as a developer for a company. You have been asked to join a project team that will be implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. You are new to IoT and need to gain an understanding of what the solution will include. You decide to spend some time researching IoT solution architecture.

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine the subsystems that make up an IoT architecture and cross-cutting concerns.
 -  Learn about data workflows between device and cloud and between cloud services.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the components and data workflows of an IoT solution.
