Azure Machine Learning provides data scientists with several resources and assets to build and manage machine learning models. 

You can create and manage resources and assets by using various tools that interact with the Azure Machine Learning workspace. 

Though you can use any tool to perform the same tasks, each tool provides advantages and disadvantages for specific workloads. You can choose which tool or developer approach best fits your needs.

> [!Important]
> Azure Machine Learning has introduced version 2 (v2) to introduce a consistency of features and terminology across interfaces. You should use v2 if you're starting a new machine learning project. Therefore, this module only covers v2. Learn more about [deciding between v1 and v2](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-migrate-from-v1?azure-portal=true).

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how and when to use:

- The Azure Machine Learning studio.
- The Python Software Development Kit (SDK).
- The Azure Command Line Interface (CLI).
