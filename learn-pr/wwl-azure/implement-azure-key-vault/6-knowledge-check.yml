  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the below methods of authenticating to Azure Key Vault is recommended for most scenarios?"
    choices:
    - content: "Service principal and certificate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is not recommended because it is difficult to automatically rotate the bootstrap secret that's used to authenticate to Key Vault."
    - content: "Service principal and secret"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is not recommended because the application owner or developer must rotate the certificate."
    - content: "Managed identities"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The benefit of this approach is that the app or service isn't managing the rotation of the first secret. Azure automatically rotates the identity."
