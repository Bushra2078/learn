    choices:
    - content: "Service principal and certificate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This method is not recommended because it is difficult to automatically rotate the bootstrap secret that's used to authenticate to Key Vault."
    - content: "Service principal and secret"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This method is not recommended because the application owner or developer must rotate the certificate."
    - content: "Managed identities"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The benefit of this approach is that Azure automatically rotates the identity."
  - content: "Azure Key Vault protects data when it is traveling between Azure Key Vault and clients. What protocol does it use for encryption?"
    choices:
    - content: "Secure Sockets Layer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Secure Sockets Layer protocol has been replaced with the Transport Layer Security protocol."
    - content: "Transport Layer Security"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Key Vault enforces Transport Layer Security protocol to protect data when itâ€™s traveling between Azure Key Vault and clients."
    - content: "Presentation Layer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Presentation Layer is part of the Open Systems Interconnection model and is not a security protocol."
