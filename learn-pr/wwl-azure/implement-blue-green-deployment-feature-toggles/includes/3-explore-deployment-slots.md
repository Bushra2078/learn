When using a cloud platform like Azure, doing blue-green deployments is relatively easy.

You don't need to write your code or set up infrastructure.

When using web apps, you can use an out-of-the-box feature called deployment slots.

Deployment slots are a feature of Azure App Service. They're live apps with their hostnames.

You can create different slots for your application (for example, Dev, Test, or Stage).

The production slot is the slot where your live app stays.

With deployment slots, you can validate app changes in staging before swapping them with your production slot.

You can use a deployment slot to set up a new version of your application, and when ready, swap the production environment with the new staging environment.

It's done by an internal swapping of the IP addresses of both slots.
