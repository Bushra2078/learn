Now that you've set up messaging for the Spring Petclinic application, the next thing you'll do is configure Azure Event Hubs to receive events.

Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service thatâ€™s simple, trusted, and scalable. Stream millions of events per second from any source to build dynamic data pipelines and immediately respond to business challenges. Keep processing data during emergencies using the geo-disaster recovery and geo-replication features.
