Using a mobile app in combination with Git is a convenient option, particularly when urgent pull request approvals are required.

 -  The app can render markdown, images, and PDF files directly on the mobile device.
 -  Pull requests can be managed within the app, along with marking files as viewed, collapsing files.
 -  Comments can be added.
 -  Emoji short codes are rendered.
