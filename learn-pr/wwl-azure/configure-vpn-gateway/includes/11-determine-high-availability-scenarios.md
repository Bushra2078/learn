## Active/standby

Every Azure VPN gateway consists of two instances in an active-standby configuration. For any planned maintenance or unplanned disruption that happens to the active instance, the standby instance would take over (failover) automatically, and resume the S2S VPN or VNet-to-VNet connections. The switch over will cause a brief interruption. For planned maintenance, the connectivity should be restored within 10 to 15 seconds. For unplanned issues, the connection recovery will be longer, about 1 minute to 1 and a half minutes in the worst case. For P2S VPN client connections to the gateway, the P2S connections will be disconnected and the users will need to reconnect from the client machines.

## Active/active

You can now create an Azure VPN gateway in an active-active configuration, where both instances of the gateway VMs will establish S2S VPN tunnels to your on-premises VPN device.

In this configuration, each Azure gateway instance will have a unique public IP address, and each will establish an IPsec/IKE S2S VPN tunnel to your on-premises VPN device specified in your local network gateway and connection. Both VPN tunnels are actually part of the same connection. You will still need to configure your on-premises VPN device to accept or establish two S2S VPN tunnels to those two Azure VPN gateway public IP addresses.

When in active-active configuration, the traffic from your Azure virtual network to your on-premises network will be routed through both tunnels simultaneously. The same TCP or UDP flow will always traverse the same tunnel or path, unless a maintenance event happens on one of the instances.

When a planned maintenance or unplanned event happens to one gateway instance, the IPsec tunnel from that instance to your on-premises VPN device will be disconnected. The corresponding routes on your VPN devices should be removed or withdrawn automatically so that the traffic will be switched over to the other active IPsec tunnel. On the Azure side, the switch over will happen automatically from the affected instance to the active instance.
