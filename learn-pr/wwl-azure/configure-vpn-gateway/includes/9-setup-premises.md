There is a validated list of standard VPN devices that work well with the VPN gateway. This list was created in partnership with device manufacturers like Cisco, Juniper, Ubiquiti, and Barracuda Networks.

When your device is not listed in the validated VPN devices table, the device may still work. Contact your device manufacturer for support and configuration instructions.

To configure your VPN device, you will need:

 -  **A shared key**. The same shared key that you specify when creating the VPN connection.
 -  **The public IP address of your VPN gateway**. The IP address can be new or existing.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the VPN device that you have, you may be able to [download a VPN device configuration script](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-download-vpndevicescript).
