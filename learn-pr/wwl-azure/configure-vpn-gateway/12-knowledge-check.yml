  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "How can you enable the VPN gateway to work with Azure ExpressRoute?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implement a policy-based VPN gateway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Policy-based gateways have limited capabilities and shouldn't be used for AzureExpressRoute."
    - content: "Implement a route-based VPN gateway."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Typical route-based gateway scenarios include point-to-site (P2S), inter-virtual network (VNet-to-VNet), or multiple site-to-site (S2S) connections. A route-based VPN is also selected to coexist with an ExpressRoute gateway or when the IKEv2 protocol is used."
    - content: "Implement a path-based VPN gateway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. _Path-based_ isn't a valid type of VPN gateway."
  - content: "Which implementation decision most influences VPN gateway performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "A route-based VPN gateway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although a route-based VPN approach can affect performance, there's another choice that can have greater influence."
    - content: "A policy-based VPN gateway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although a policy-based VPN approach can affect performance, there's another choice that can have greater influence."
    - content: "The appropriate Azure VPN Gateway SKU."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The most significant implementation decision for your VPN gateway performance is selecting the appropriate SKU for your configuration. Performance is measured through **Aggregate Throughput Benchmarks** provided for each Azure VPN Gateway SKU."
  - content: "What key piece of information do you need to set up the on-premises VPN gateway?"
    choices:
    - content: "The shared key provided when the site-to-site (S2S) VPN connection was created."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The shared key is required to set up the on-premises VPN gateway."
    - content: "The shared access signature (SAS) key for the recovery services vault."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The SAS key and recovery service vault aren't needed."
    - content: "The private IP address of the virtual network gateway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The private IP address of the virtual network gateway isn't required."
