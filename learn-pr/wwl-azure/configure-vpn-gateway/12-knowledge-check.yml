  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "The company's VPN gateway must work with ExpressRoute. Which VPN type should be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "Policy-based"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Policy-based gateways have very limited capabilities and should not be used for ExpressRoute."
    - content: "Route-based"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Typical route-based gateway scenarios include point-to-site, inter-virtual network, or multiple site-to-site connections. Route-based is also selected when you coexist with an ExpressRoute gateway or if you need to use IKEv2."
    - content: "Path-based"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Path-based is not a VPN type."
  - content: "The infrastructure team is connecting two virtual networks. Performance is a key concern. Which of the following will most influence performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ensuring you select a route-based VPN."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although routing can affect performance, another choice will have more influence."
    - content: "Ensuring you select an appropriate Gateway SKU"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Ensuring you select a policy-based VPN."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although routing can affect performance, another choice will have more influence."
  - content: "The infrastructure teams needs to configure a site-to-site VPN connection between the on-premises network and theAzure network. The on-premises network uses a Cisco ASA VPN device. Before starting the configuration, which of the following is required?"
    choices:

      explanation: "That's incorrect. The recovery service vault is not needed."
    - content: "The private IP address of your virtual network gateway."
      isCorrect: false
