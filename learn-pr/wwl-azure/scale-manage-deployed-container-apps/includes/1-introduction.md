Azure Container Apps is a platform that helps manage the release of updates to your container app by creating a new revision each time you make a revision-scope change to your app.

Imagine you have a container app that needs to be updated frequently. You want to manage the release of updates to your container app by creating a new revision each time you make a revision-scope change to your app. You can use revisions to release a new version of your app, quickly revert to an earlier version of your app, split traffic between revisions for A/B testing, and gradually phase in a new revision in blue-green deployments.

The module covers the following topics: Examine revisions in Azure Container Apps, Examine application lifecycle management in Azure Container Apps, Examine scaling options in Azure Container Apps, and Examine ingress settings for traffic-splitting and blue-green deployments.

The goal of this module is to help you understand how to manage the release of updates to your container app by creating a new revision each time you make a revision-scope change to your app. You learn how to release a new version of your app, quickly revert to an earlier version of your app, split traffic between revisions for A/B testing, and gradually phase in a new revision in blue-green deployments.
