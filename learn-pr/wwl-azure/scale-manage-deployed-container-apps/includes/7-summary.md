In this module, you have learned about revisions in Azure Container Apps. Revisions help manage the release of updates to your container app by creating a new revision each time you make a revision-scope change to your app. You can control which revisions are active and the external traffic that is routed to each active revision. Revision modes control whether only a single revision or multiple revisions of your container app can be simultaneously active. Labels are a portable means to direct traffic to specific revisions for container apps with external HTTP traffic.

The main takeaways from this module are that revisions in Azure Container Apps help manage the release of updates to your container app, and you can control which revisions are active and the external traffic that is routed to each active revision. Additionally, labels are a portable means to direct traffic to specific revisions for container apps with external HTTP traffic.
