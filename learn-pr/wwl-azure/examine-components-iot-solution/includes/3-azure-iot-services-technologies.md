IoT solutions require a combination of technologies to effectively connect devices, events, and actions to cloud applications. The technologies and services you use depend on your scenario's development, deployment, and management needs.

The Azure IoT technologies and services stack provides two platform options for the digital transformation for your organization.

 -  Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which you tailor Azure hardware and software tools to a specific task or job function. With PaaS services, you're responsible for scaling and configuration, but the underlying infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is taken care of for you.
 -  Application platform as a service (aPaaS) provides a cloud environment to build, manage, and deliver applications to customers. aPaaS offerings take care of scaling and most of the configuration, but they still require developer input to build out a finished solution.

## Managed aPaaS solutions

Get started quickly with Azure IoT Central, a fully managed, end-to-end solution that enables powerful IoT scenarios without requiring cloud-solution expertise.

The IoT Central application platform is a ready-made environment for IoT solution development. Built on trusted Azure PaaS services it reduces the burden and cost of developing, managing, and maintaining enterprise-grade IoT solutions. It delivers built-in disaster recovery, multitenancy, global availability, and a predictable cost structure.<br>

IoT Central's customizable web UI and API surface let you monitor and manage millions of devices and their data throughout their life cycle. Get started exploring IoT Central in minutes using your phone as an IoT device â€“ see live telemetry, create rules, run commands from the cloud, and export your data for business analytics.

Choose devices from the Azure Certified for IoT device catalog to quickly connect to your solution, or develop a custom device using IoT Central's device templates.

## Flexible PaaS solutions

With the most comprehensive portfolio of IoT services, Azure PaaS technologies for IoT enable you to easily create, customize, and control all aspects of your IoT solution. Establish bi-directional communications with billions of IoT devices and manage your IoT devices at scale using IoT Hub. Then integrate your IoT device data with other platform services, such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Stream Analytics, to enhance insights across your solution.

To build an IoT solution from scratch, use one or more of the following Azure IoT technologies and services:

### Devices

Develop your IoT devices using one of the Azure IoT Starter Kits or choose a device to use from the Azure Certified for IoT device catalog. Implement your embedded code using the open-source device SDKs. The device SDKs support multiple operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and real-time operating systems. There are SDKs for multiple programming languages, such as C, Node.js, Java, .NET, and Python.

You can further simplify how you create the embedded code for your devices by using the IoT Plug and Play service. IoT Plug and Play enables solution developers to integrate devices with their solutions without writing any embedded code. At the core of IoT Plug and Play, is a device capability model schema that describes device capabilities. Use the device capability model to generate your embedded device code and configure a cloud-based solution such as an IoT Central application.

Azure IoT Edge lets you offload parts of your IoT workload from your Azure cloud services to your devices. IoT Edge can reduce latency in your solution, reduce the amount of data your devices exchange with the cloud, and enable off-line scenarios. You can manage IoT Edge devices from IoT Central and some solution accelerators.

Azure Sphere is a secured, high-level application platform with built-in communication and security features for internet-connected devices. It includes a secured microcontroller unit, a custom Linux-based operating system, and a cloud-based security service that provides continuous, renewable security.

### Cloud connectivity

The Azure IoT Hub service enables reliable and secure bidirectional communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-based solution. Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service is a helper service for IoT Hub. The service provides zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning of devices to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention. These capabilities enable customers to provision millions of devices in a secure and scalable manner.

IoT Hub is a core component of the solution accelerators and you can use it to meet IoT implementation challenges such as:

 -  High-volume device connectivity and management.
 -  High-volume telemetry ingestion.
 -  Command and control of devices.
 -  Device security enforcement.

### Bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds

Azure Digital Twins is an IoT service that enables you to model a physical environment. It uses a spatial intelligence graph to model the relationships between people, spaces, and devices. By corelating data across the digital and physical worlds you can create contextually aware solutions.

Iot Central uses digital twins to synchronize devices and data in the real world with the digital models that enable users to monitor and manage those connected devices.

### Data and analytics

IoT devices typically generate large amounts of time series data, such as temperature readings from sensors. Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Data Explorer can be used to process, query, analyze, and visualize data.

Azure Maps is a collection of geospatial services that use fresh mapping data to provide accurate geographic context to web and mobile applications. You can use a REST API, a web-based JavaScript control, or an Android SDK to build your applications.
