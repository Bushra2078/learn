Before you start building an IoT solution, it is important to understand the resources that are available to you.

Suppose you have joined a team that will be implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The team has a general understanding of the solution architecture but needs more information about the individual components. You decide to examine the primary components that make up an IoT solution.

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine the device hardware and cloud service components of an IoT solution.
 -  Review some of the device software options and Azure IoT technologies that are available to you.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the Azure IoT services and tools that you will use to develop an IoT solution.
