In this set of exercises, you will test conditional access.

## Task 1 - Configure conditional access (require MFA)

> [!NOTE]
> This task requires a user account, AZ500User1. If you want to show the MFA verification, the user account must have a phone number.

This task will review conditional access policy settings and create a policy that requires MFA when signing in to the Portal.

### Configure the policy

1. In the **Portal,** search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Under **Manage,** select **Security**.
1. Under **Protect,** select **Conditional access**.
1. Click **New Policy**.
     -  Name: **AZ500Policy1**
     -  Users and groups &gt; Select users and groups &gt; Users and Groups &gt; Select: **AZ500User1**
     -  Cloud apps or actions &gt; Select apps &gt; Select: **Microsoft Azure Management**
     -  Review the warning that this policy impacts Portal access.
     -  Conditions &gt; Sign-in risk &gt; Review the risk levels
     -  Device platforms &gt; Review the devices that can be included, such as Android and iOS.
     -  Locations &gt; Review the physical location selections.
     -  Under **Access controls** click **Grant**.
     -  Review the Grant options such as MFA. You may require one or more of the controls.
     -  Select **Require multi-factor authentication**.
     -  For **Enable policy,** select **On**.
1. Click **Create**.

### Test the policy

1. Sign in to the **Portal** as the **AZ500User1**.
1. Before you can sign in, a second authentication is required.
1. If you have a phone number associated with the user, provide and verify the text code. You should be able to sign in to the Portal successfully.
1. If you do not have a phone number associated with the user, this demonstrates that MFA is in effect.
1. You may want to return to the **AZ500Policy1** and turn the policy **Off**.
