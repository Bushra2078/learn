Conditional access is a capability of Azure AD (with an Azure AD Premium license) that enables you to enforce controls on the access to apps in your environment based on specific conditions from a central location. With Azure AD conditional access, you can factor how a resource is being accessed into an access control decision. By using conditional access policies, you can apply the correct access controls under the required conditions.

Conditional access comes with six conditions: user/group, cloud application, device state, location (IP range), client application, and sign-in risk. You can use combinations of these conditions to get the exact conditional access policy you need. Notice on this image the conditions determine the access control from the previous topic.

With access controls, you can either Block Access altogether or Grant Access with additional requirements by selecting the desired controls. You can have several options:

* Require MFA from Azure AD or an on-premises MFA (combined with AD FS).

* Grant access to only trusted devices.

* Require a domain-joined device.

* Require mobile devices to use Intune app protection policies.

Requiring additional account verification through MFA is a common conditional access scenario. While users may be able to sign-in to most of your organizationâ€™s cloud apps, you may want that additional verification for things like your email system, or apps that contain personnel records or sensitive information. In Azure AD, you can accomplish this with a conditional access policy

>The Users and Groups condition is mandatory in a conditional access policy. In your policy, you can either select All users or select specific users and groups.
