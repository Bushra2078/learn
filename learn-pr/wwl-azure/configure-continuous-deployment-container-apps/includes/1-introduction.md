This module covers the use of Azure Pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

In this module, you will learn how to configure a pipeline to use the self-hosted pool, use built-in tasks, and deploy a self-hosted Windows agent. You will also examine agents and agent pools for pipelines, environment and secret variables for pipelines.

The module is divided into the following sections: Revision management, Continuous deployment to Azure Container Apps, Azure Pipeline configuration and deployment tasks, and Agents and agent pools for pipelines.

The goal of this module is to teach you how to use Azure Pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes, and how to configure and manage agents and agent pools for pipelines.
