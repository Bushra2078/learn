  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your IT helpdesk wants to reduce password reset support tickets. You suggest having users sign-in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same password. Your organization does not plan on using Azure AD Identity Protection, so which feature would be easiest to implement given the requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Federation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Federation is connecting two domains, but not specifically eliminate the need to sign-in to both systems."
    - content: "Pass-through authentication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Pass-through authentication. Pass-through Authentication (PTA) allows your users to sign-in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications by using the same passwords. PTA signs users in by validating their passwords directly against on-premises Active Directory. PTA does not provide Azure AD Identity Protection leaked credential reports."
    - content: "Password hash synchronization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option just shares the password hash between two federated systems."
  - content: "Which tool can you use to synchronize Active AD passwords with on-premises Active Directory?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure AD Connect"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure AD Connect. Azure AD Connect sync is a main component of Azure AD Connect. It takes care of all the operations that are related to synchronize identity data between your on-premises environment and Azure AD."
    - content: "Active Directory Federation Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Active Directory Federation Services is an authentication and authorization service for Windows Server."
    - content: "Password writeback"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This service is used after the synchronization is complete to maintain your passwords."
  - content: "Azure AD does not use which of the following security protocols? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "Kerberos"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Kerberos. Because Azure AD is HTTP/HTTPS based, it does not use Kerberos authentication. Instead, it uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication (and OAuth for authorization)."
    - content: "OAuth"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "OAuth is used for authentication and authorization."
    - content: "OpenID"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "OpenID is an authentication protocol used for web apps in Azure."
  - content: "Which of the following is not a passwordless authentication option that integrates with Azure Active Directory? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "FIDO2 security keys"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "FIDO2 security keys are an available passwordless authentication method in Azure."
    - content: "Microsoft Authenticator app"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can use the Authenticator app for passwordless connections to Azure."
    - content: "Azure Multi-Factor Authentication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a great way to secure your organization, but users often get frustrated with the extra security layer on top of having to remember their passwords. Passwordless authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and replaced with something you have, plus something you are or something you know. The other choices are passwordless authentication optionsâ€¯that integrate with Azure AD. Azure AD DS) enables the use of ciphers such as NTLM v1 and TLS v1."
