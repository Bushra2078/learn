**Azure AD Pass-through Authentication** (PTA) is an alternative to Azure AD Password Hash Synchronization, and provides the same benefit of cloud authentication to organizations. PTA allows users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same user account and passwords. When users sign-in using Azure AD, Pass-through authentication validates the usersâ€™ passwords directly against an organization's on-premise Active Directory.

## Feature benefits

+ Supports user sign-in into all web browser-based applications and into Microsoft Office client applications that use modern authentication.
+ Sign-in usernames can be either the on-premises default username (userPrincipalName) or another attribute configured in Azure AD Connect (known as Alternate ID).
+ Works seamlessly with conditional access features such as Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication to help secure your users.
+ Integrated with cloud-based self-service password management, including password writeback to on-premises Active Directory and password protection by banning commonly used passwords.
+ Multi-forest environments are supported if there are forest trusts between your AD forests and if name suffix routing is correctly configured.
+ PTA is a free feature, and you don't need any paid editions of Azure AD to use it.
+ PTA can be enabled via Azure AD Connect.
+ PTA uses a lightweight on-premises agent that listens for and responds to password validation requests.
+ Installing multiple agents provides high availability of sign-in requests.
+ PTA protects your on-premises accounts against brute force password attacks in the cloud.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This feature can be configured without using a federation service so that any organization, regardless of size, can implement a hybrid identity solution. Pass-through authentication is not only for user sign-in but allows an organization to use other Azure AD features, such as password management, role-based access control, published applications, and conditional access policies.
