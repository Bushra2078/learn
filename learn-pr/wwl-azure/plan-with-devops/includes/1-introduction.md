DevOps influences the entire application lifecycle starting with the planning phase.

Imagine you work for a software development company in the retail industry. Your company is planning to migrate an online store from an old app to a new app to stay competitive in the market. The development and operations teams are working in silos, with little collaboration and communication, and lack of accountability which has made planning your project more difficult. To address these issues, your organization decides to adopt a DevOps approach to build mutual respect among teams, set clearly defined roles and responsiblities, become agile, and implement practices that improve collaboration and communication. 

In this module, you'll learn how to foster a DevOps culture in an organization by promoting collaboration, transparency, shared responsibility, and continuous learning. You'll learn about the importance of an Agile approach to software development and project management as part of DevOps, the characteristics of different agile frameworks, fundamental DevOps practices such as version control, continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous delivery, continuous monitoring, continuous security, and Infrastructure as Code, and how GitHub Projects can facilitate the planning of your projects. 

By the end of this module, you'll have a clear understanding of the principles, practices, and values of DevOps and how they can be applied to optimize application lifecycle management in every phase from planning to operations.
