      explanation: "That's incorrect. Workloads can be flexible or fixed in the cloud."
    - content: "Unpredictable costs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Costs are based on the usage, so may not always be predictable."

    - content: "Operational expenditures"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Operational expenses are on-going expenses that land as you use a given service or feature."
    - content: "Supply and demand"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Supply and demand is a business concept for managing your inventory versus a way of spending money on cloud services."
  - content: "Which of the following terms refer to making a service available with no downtime for an extended period of time?"
    choices:
    - content: "Agility"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Agility is the ability to add or remove resources to support peaks in your resource usage."
    - content: "Fault tolerance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Fault tolerance is the ability to have an interruption or fault in your service without your application going offline."
    - content: "High availability"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. High availability keeps services up and running for long periods of time, with little downtime, depending on the service in question."
  - content: "Which term from the list below would be viewed as benefits of using cloud services?"
    choices:
    - content: "Unpredictable costs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Cloud computing typically has predictable 'pay-as-you-go' costing models."
    - content: "Local reach only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While you can isolate cloud resources and make them private, most of the time the services are public facing and reachable over the internet."
    - content: "Elasticity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Elasticity, agility and economies of scale are the correct answers, and would be seen as benefits that you can gain from using cloud services."
  - content: "From the choices below, what is one of the advantages of moving your infrastructure to Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "The move reduces Capital Expenditures. (CapEx)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Public Cloud deployments reduce Capital Expenditures because there is far less infrastructure to buy; you effectively rent only what you use as you use it â€“ CapEx is the best answer."
    - content: "The move reduces Operational Expenses (OpEx)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You will still have Operational Expenses, as you will still need to do certain parts of the work; the cost may be reduced from prior levels, but it will not be fully done away with."
    - content: "The move allows for complete control of infrastructure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Because infrastructure resources are cloud-based and owned by the Cloud Service Provider, there is limited to no real control of those resources."
