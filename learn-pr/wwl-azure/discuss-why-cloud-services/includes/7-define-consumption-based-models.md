Cloud service providers operate on a **consumption-based model**, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for.

A consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

+ No upfront costs.

+ No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that they may or may not use to its fullest.

+ The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.

+ The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Consumption-based models also allow for better cost prediction. Prices for individual resources and services are provided so you can predict how much you will spend in a given billing period based on your expected usage. You can also perform analysis based on future growth using historical usage data tracked by your cloud provider.

## Contoso Ltd. Case Study - Consumption-Based Usage

Consumption-based usage is best capability for us here at the Contoso, as we are only paying for what we consume! We have systems designed to take a ton of load, but often they are sitting idle. During the last shopping season, we had more than 1000 servers just waiting to collect and process data. "Waiting" being the operative word, simply because we were paying for them even when they were idle.

The ability to build out the application, deploy it to cloud, and only pay for it when (and how) it is being used, is great. We can have one server deployed and waiting for users, and we only pay a small amount.  Then when more users start connecting at peak shopping times, we can just add a few extra servers to our site. The system works well because we only pay for them while they are working, and then we disconnect them when they are not needed.

The model of just paying for what we use will save us money and time, and reduce the cost of our programs.
