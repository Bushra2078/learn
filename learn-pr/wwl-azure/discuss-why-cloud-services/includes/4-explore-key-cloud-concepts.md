Cloud services is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Cloud services have characteristics and considerations, some of which are outlined and explained below:

- **High availability**. The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime, depending on the service in question.

- **Scalability**. The ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload. You can add additional resources to service a workload (known as *scaling out*), or add additional capabilities to manage an increase in demand to the existing resource (known as *scaling up*). Scalability doesn't have to be done automatically.

- **Elasticity**. The ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed. Elastic resources match the current needs, and resources are added or removed automatically to meet future needs when it’s needed (and from the most advantageous geographic location). A distinction between scalability and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.

- **Agility**. The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. They are provided on-demand via self-service, so vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. There is no manual intervention in provisioning or deprovisioning services.

- **Fault tolerance**. The ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. Typically, redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. This type of service is said to be tolerant of faults.

- **Disaster recovery**. The ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily available to use.

- **Global reach**. The ability to reach audiences around the globe. Cloud services can have a presence in various regions across the globe, which you and your customer can access, giving you a presence in those regions even though you may not have any infrastructure in that region.

- **Customer latency capabilities**. If customers are experiencing slowness with a particular cloud service, they are said to be experiencing some latency. Even though modern fiber optics are fast, it can still take time for services to react to customer actions if the service is not local to the customer. Cloud services have the ability to deploy resources in datacenters around the globe, which addresses any customer latency issues.

- **Predictive cost considerations**. The ability for users to predict the costs they will incur for a particular cloud service. Costs for individual services are made available, and tools are provided to allow you to predict the costs a service will incur. You can also perform analysis based on planned growth.

- **Technical skill requirements and considerations**. Cloud services can provide and manage hardware and software for workloads. Getting a workload up and running with cloud services demands less technical resources than having IT teams build and maintain a physical infrastructure for handling the same workload. A user can be an expert in the application they want to run without requiring skills to build and maintain the underlying hardware and software infrastructure.

- **Increased productivity**. On-site datacenters typically require a lot of hardware setup (otherwise known as *racking and stacking*), software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing eliminates the need for many of these tasks. This allows IT teams to spend time focusing on achieving more important business goals.

- **Security**. Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technology skills that can provide better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve. The result is strengthened security, which helps to protect data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.

> ## Inline - Contoso, Ltd. Case Study
>
> Wow, those are some great benefits to moving to the cloud and addressing the capability needs of Contoso. I bet your applications could benefit as well. Let's take a quick look at several of these in the context of the growth of Contoso Ltd:
> 
>**High Availability** is a must. At Contoso, we make money and keep our customers happy when they can quickly access our products.  When our site goes down, or our shipping systems and drones can't talk with each other, it becomes a critical situation.
>
>**Scalability** and **Elasticity** is something that we at Contoso have wished for in the past. We have purchased thousands of servers, had to manually set each one up and manage it, and then many of the servers sit idle, waiting on users to log-in. They use power, heating / cooling, and have to be maintained. When there was a rush of people logging in during seasonal parts of the year, things really bogged down due to our lack of flexibility.
>
>**Disaster Recovery** would be great to have. Right now, we run an on-premises backup system, and then transport the backup offsite for storage. This is time consuming, costly, and really slow to restore if we ever have an issue. Backing up customers orders, history, and data the moment it is entered is an absolute must.  We can't survive if we cannot get to our customer's information.
> We could keep going with all of these items.  Why don't you take a moment and think about how each of these are applicable to your daily business.

## Try this exercise:
1. Grab a piece of paper.
2. Write down three of the key cloud concepts.
3. Next to each concept you listed, write out a scenario where your company has experience. Where might one (or more) of the cloud concepts/capabilities have helped?
