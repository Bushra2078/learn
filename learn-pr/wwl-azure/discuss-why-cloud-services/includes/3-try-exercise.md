It is always good to start using a product as soon as possible.  Let's take a few minutes and look at the Azure portal.  In this unguided lab, feel free to have a look around all the available Azure features.

## Try this exercise:

1. Open a browser.
2. Enter the URL [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true)
3. Take a few minutes and look at the site.
4. Can you find:

   - Where to create a resource like a Virtual Machine?
   - How to launch your Dashboard to see what resources you have?
   - Where is the Microsoft Learn training linked to help you learn more?

5. Close your browser.
