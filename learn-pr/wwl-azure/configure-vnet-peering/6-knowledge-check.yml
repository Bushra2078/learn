  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Virtual network peering is successfully established when the peering status for both virtual network peerings shows which status?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connected"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The peering is not successfully established until the peering status for both virtual network peerings is Connected."
    - content: "Initiated"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Initiated status is shown when the peering is first created."
    - content: "Peered"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Peered is not a virtual network status."
  - content: "Which of the following allows peered virtual networks to share the gateway and get access to resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Gateway transit"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Gateway transit allows peered virtual networks to share the gateway and get access to resources."
    - content: "Point-to-site connectivity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Point-to-site creates a secure connection to a virtual network from an individual client computer."
    - content: "Transitivity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Transitivity refers to virtual networks communicating with the peers of their peers."
  - content: "Which of the following best describes virtual network peering?"
    choices:
    - content: "Creating a virtual network disrupts other resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no downtime to resources in either virtual network when creating the peering, or after the peering is created."
    - content: "Traffic between the virtual networks is kept on the Microsoft backbone network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure backbone handles traffic between virtual networks."
    - content: "Peered virtual networks must be in the same region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Global virtual network peering connects virtual networks that are in different Azure regions."
