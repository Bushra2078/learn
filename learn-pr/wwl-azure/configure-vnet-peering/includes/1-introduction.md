## Scenario

Your engineering company has been migrating services into Azure. The company has deployed services into separate virtual networks. It hasn't configured private connectivity between the virtual networks.

Several business units have identified services in these virtual networks that need to communicate with each other. You need to enable this connectivity, but you don't want to expose these services to the internet. You also want to keep the integration as simple as possible.

You need to implement a virtual network peering solution. This solution should address transit and connectivity concerns.

## Skills measured

Configuring virtual network peering is part of [Exam AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](/learn/certifications/exams/az-104).
