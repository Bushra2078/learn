Azure Virtual Network peering lets you connect virtual networks in the same or different regions, so resources in both networks can communicate with each other.

In this module, suppose your engineering company is migrating services to Azure. The company has deployed services into separate Azure virtual networks. Private connectivity between the virtual networks isn't yet configured. Several business units have identified services in the virtual networks that need to communicate with each other. 

You're responsible for implementing an Azure Virtual Network peering solution and enabling connectivity between the virtual networks. Two of your strategy goals include preventing exposure of the services to the internet, and keeping the integration as simple as possible. Your solution should address transit and connectivity concerns.
