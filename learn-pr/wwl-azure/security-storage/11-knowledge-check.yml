  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the recommended way to manage and rotate your Azure storage account access keys?"
    choices:
    - content: "Save access keys in plain text accessible to others"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is not a secure way to manage your access keys."
    - content: "Hard code access keys in your application code"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is not a secure way to manage your access keys."
    - content: "Use Azure Key Vault to manage and rotate your keys"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Key Vault makes it easy to rotate your keys without interruption to your applications and provides secure management of your access keys."
  - content: "What is the purpose of using Azure Key Vault to manage storage account access keys?"
    choices:
    - content: "To limit access to the data stored in the storage account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While access keys do provide access to both the configuration and data of a storage account, the purpose of using Azure Key Vault is to manage and rotate these keys securely."
    - content: "To generate new access keys for each storage account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Key Vault does not generate new access keys, but it can be used to manage and rotate existing ones."
    - content: "To manage and rotate existing access keys securely"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Key Vault provides a secure way to manage and rotate storage account access keys, which should be done regularly to maintain security."
  - content: "What is the recommended way to authorize access to data in Azure Storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using Shared Key authorization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Shared Key authorization is not recommended as it may be less secure."
    - content: "Using access keys and connection strings for all apps accessing production or sensitive data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Use of access keys and connection strings should be limited to initial proof of concept apps or development prototypes that don't access production or sensitive data."
    - content: "Using either Microsoft Entra ID or a shared access signature SAS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Microsoft recommends that clients use either Microsoft Entra ID or a shared access signature SAS to authorize access to data in Azure Storage."
  - content: "What is the purpose of authorizing access to resources in Azure Storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "To restrict access to resources only to users with Microsoft Entra Domain Services authorization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Microsoft Entra Domain Services is one option for authorization, it is not the only option and restricting access only to users with Microsoft Entra Domain Services authorization would limit access to resources."
    - content: "To make resources public and accessible to any user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would allow anonymous read access and is not a secure way to manage access to resources."
    - content: "To ensure that resources are accessible only when authorized and only to those users or applications to whom access is granted"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Authorization ensures that resources are secure and only accessible to authorized users or applications."
  - content: "A company wants to ensure that only authorized users have access to their Azure Storage resources. Which of the following authorization options should they use to achieve this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Anonymous public read access"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This option allows anyone to access the resources without any authorization."
    - content: "Shared Key storage account key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this option provides authorization, it requires storing the account access key with the code, which is not recommended for security reasons."
    - content: "Microsoft Entra ID"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This option provides fine-grained access control to users, groups, or applications via role-based access control (RBAC) and avoids the need to store the account access key with the code."
