  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following SAP tiers is it recommended that you protect by replicating using Azure Site Recovery? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "Active Directory virtual machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "SAP Central Services cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It is recommended that you use Azure Site Recovery to protect the SAP Web Dispatcher Pool, SAP Application server pool, and the SAP Central Services cluster. For Active Directory virtual machines, Active Directory replication is recommended, and for SQL Server databases, SQL Always On replication is recommended."
    - content: "SQL Server databases"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
  - content: "Is simple availability between two Azure regions with manual failover a good choice if you require RPO = 0?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In this configuration, you can't attain RPO = 0 because your HANA system replication mode is asynchronous. If you need to provide an RPO = 0, this configuration isn't the configuration of choice."
    - content: "Only if the regions are geographically adjacent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
  - content: "If you are trying to implement SAP HANA high availability, and you require RPO = 0 and resistance to natural catastrophes that affect large areas, which configuration should you consider? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "Simple availability between two Azure regions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
    - content: "SAP HANA multi-tier system replication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Simple availability between two regions does not allow for RPO = 0, because of asynchronous replication. Multi-tier system replication allows RPO = 0 with synchronous replication and auto-failover within Region 1, while still maintaining a Region 2 secondary site at a sufficient distance to be unaffected by regional disasters."
    - content: "Either configuration is suitable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that is incorrect."
