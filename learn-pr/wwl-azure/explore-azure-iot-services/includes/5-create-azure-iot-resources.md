> [!WARNING]
> Be prepared for UI changes

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content that do not match up with lab instructions presented in this lab manual.

The Microsoft Learning team will update this training course as soon as we can when any such changes are brought to our attention. However, given the dynamic nature of cloud updates, you may run into UI changes before this training content is updated. If this occurs, you will have to adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.

\[Button in the UI displays: "Sign in to launch the lab"\]
