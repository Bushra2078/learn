The Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service resources include the features required to customize and build complex real-world solutions.

Suppose you have joined a team that will be implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The team is new to Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service, and is not familiar with how these services are used to manage IoT devices. You decide to research the two services and then create an instance of each service in the Azure portal. With resource instances created, you will review service features by examining the resource menus.

In this module you will:

 -  Examine features of the Azure IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service resources.
 -  Review Azure resource naming requirements.
 -  Create and examine Azure IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service resources in the Azure portal.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the features of the IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service resources and create instances of the services in the Azure portal.
