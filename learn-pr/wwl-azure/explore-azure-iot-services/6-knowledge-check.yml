      explanation: "Correct. Subscription, Resource group, IoT hub name, Region, and scale tier are all marked as required fields in the UI and must be configured with a valid setting in order to create an IoT Hub instance. The S1 scale tier is selected by default, but can be changed. Additional parameters, such as Connectivity configuration, are also marked as required in the UI."
    - content: "Defender for IoT is set to Off by default and must be set to On (enabled) in order to create an instance of IoT Hub."
