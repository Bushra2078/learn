    - content: "Create an Azure RBAC role that defines the allowed virtual machine SKU sizes"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Create a policy in Azure Policy that specifies the allowed SKU sizes"

      explanation: "Correct. Management groups facilitate the hierarchical ordering of Azure resources into collections, at a level of scope above subscriptions. Distinct governance conditions can be applied to each management group, with Azure Policy and Azure role-based access controls, to manage Azure subscriptions effectively. The resources and subscriptions assigned to a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group."
