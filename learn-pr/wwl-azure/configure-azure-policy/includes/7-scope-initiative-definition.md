After you create your initiative definition, the next step is to assign the initiative to establish the scope for the policies. The scope determines what resources or grouping of resources are affected by the conditions of the policies.

Here's an example that shows how to configure the scope assignment:

To establish the scope, you select the affected subscriptions. As an option, you can also choose the affected resource groups. 

The following example shows how to apply the scope:
