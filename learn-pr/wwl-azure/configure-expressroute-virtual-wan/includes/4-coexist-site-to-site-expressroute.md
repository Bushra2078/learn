ExpressRoute is a direct, private connection from your WAN (not over the public Internet) to Microsoft Services, including Azure. Site-to-Site VPN traffic travels encrypted over the public Internet. Being able to configure Site-to-Site VPN and ExpressRoute connections for the same virtual network has several advantages.

You configure a Site-to-Site VPN as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute or use Site-to-Site VPNs to connect to sites that are not part of your network, but that are connected through ExpressRoute. Notice this configuration requires two virtual network gateways for the same virtual network, one using the gateway type *VPN*, and the other using the gateway type *ExpressRoute*.

## ExpressRoute connection models

You create a connection between your on-premises network and the Microsoft cloud in three different ways, Colocated at a cloud exchange, Point-to-point Ethernet Connection, and Any-to-any (IPVPN) Connection. Connectivity providers offer one or more connectivity models. You work with your connectivity provider to pick the model that works best for you.

### Colocated at a cloud exchange

If you are colocated in a facility with a cloud exchange, you order virtual cross-connections to the Microsoft cloud through the colocation providerâ€™s Ethernet exchange. Colocation providers offer either Layer 2 cross-connections, or managed Layer 3 cross-connections between your infrastructure in the colocation facility and the Microsoft cloud.

### Point-to-point Ethernet connections

You connect your on-premises datacenters/offices to the Microsoft cloud through point-to-point Ethernet links. Point-to-point Ethernet providers offer Layer 2 connections, or managed Layer 3 connections between your site and the Microsoft cloud.

### Any-to-any (IPVPN) networks

You integrate your WAN with the Microsoft cloud. IPVPN providers, typically Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) VPN, offer any-to-any connectivity between your branch offices and datacenters. The Microsoft cloud can be interconnected to your WAN to make it appear just like any other branch office. WAN providers typically offer managed Layer 3 connectivity.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the deployment options for S2S and ExpressRoute coexisting connections are only possible through PowerShell, and not the Azure portal.
