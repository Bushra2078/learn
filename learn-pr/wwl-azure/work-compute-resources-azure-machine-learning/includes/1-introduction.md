As a data scientist, you may train machine learning models on your local device. For large-scale projects, a single local device won't be enough to efficiently train machine learning models. When you use cloud compute for machine learning workloads, you'll be ready to scale your work when needed.

In Azure Machine Learning, you can use various types of managed cloud computes. By using any of the compute options in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you'll save time on managing compute. 

Whether you're working in notebooks during experimentation, or need to run scripts for production, Azure Machine Learning compute will help you run your workloads.

Most commonly, you'll work with either a **compute instance** or a **compute cluster** in Azure Machine Learning.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Choose the appropriate compute target.
- Create and use a compute instance.
- Create and use a compute cluster.
