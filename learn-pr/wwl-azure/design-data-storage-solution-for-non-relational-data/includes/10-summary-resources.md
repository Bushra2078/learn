In this module, you have learned how to design for non-relational data storage. You have learned different strategies for storage accounts, blob storage, file storage, disk storage, storage security, and data protection. You should now be able to:

- Design for data storage.

- Design for Azure storage accounts.

- Design for Azure blob storage.

- Design for Azure files.

- Design an Azure disk solution.

- Design for storage security.
