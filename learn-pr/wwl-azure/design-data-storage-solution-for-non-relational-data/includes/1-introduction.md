Data storage describes how different types of data are stored in your organization. The type of data storage that you implement is based on the structure of your data and the manner in which the data is accessed.

Some data is highly organized, such as machine configurations, sensitive personal information, and customer invoices. Other data can be less structured like fax images, executive presentations, and engineering white papers. Certain data is accessed by only a few individuals like administrators or file owners. Other data can be used by both all levels of users, both internal employees and external partners.
