Tailwind Traders wants to reduce storage costs by reducing duplicate content and, whenever applicable, migrating it to the cloud. The company would like a solution that centralizes maintenance while still providing nation-wide access for customers. Customers should be able to browse and purchase items online even in a case of a failure affecting an entire Azure region. Here are some specific requirements.

- **Warranty document retention.** The company’s risk and legal teams requires warranty documents be kept for three years. 

- **New photos and videos.** The company would like each product to have a photo or video to demonstrate the product features.

- **External vendor development.** A vendor will create and develop some of the online ecommerce features. The developer will need access to the HTML files, but only during the development phase.

- **Product catalog updates.** The product catalog is updated every few months. Older versions of the catalog aren’t viewed frequently but must be available immediately if accessed.
