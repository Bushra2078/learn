The cloud is changing how applications are designed and secured. Instead of monoliths, applications are divided into smaller, decentralized services. 

These services communicate through APIs or by using asynchronous messaging or events. The services scale horizontally, adding new instances as demand requires.

These design changes bring new challenges. Application states are distributed, and operations are done in parallel and asynchronously. Applications must:

- Communicate with each other effectively.

- Be able to be deployed rapidly.

- Be resilient when failures occur.

- Be able to integrate with other systems seamlessly.

Azure lets you create applications composed of various components: 

- Website front ends

- Back-end services

- Triggered functions 

Azure includes various communication strategies to let these various components pass data to each other.

After completing this module, you’ll be able to evaluate and design an effective application architecture. This architecture provides the best Azure solutions for exchanging messages. It also helps automate deployment solutions for your applications and manage configurations. Azure also enables integration with APIs and provides appropriate caching. 

## Learning objectives
