- **Transaction processing**. When a customer makes a purchase, details should be grouped into a single transaction.  

- **Update management.** Developers require scheduled software deployments and expect installation of updates within a defined maintenance window.

- **Event handling**. During game play millions of events are expected per second. Players will expect a low latency on responses. The event stream should be saved to blob storage.

Choose the best response for each of the questions below. Then select **Check your answers**.
