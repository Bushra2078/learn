Continuous Integration is one of the key pillars of DevOps.

Once you have your code in a version control system, you need an automated way of integrating the code on an ongoing basis.

Azure Pipelines can be used to create a fully featured cross-platform CI and CD service.

It works with your preferred Git provider and can deploy to most major cloud services, including Azure.

This module details continuous integration practice and the pillars for implementing it in the development lifecycle, its benefits, and properties.
