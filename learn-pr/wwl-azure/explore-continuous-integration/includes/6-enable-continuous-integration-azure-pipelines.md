**Estimated time:** 45 minutes.

**Lab files:** none.<br>

## Scenario

This lab will teach you how to configure continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) for your applications using Build and Release in Azure Pipelines. This scriptable CI/CD system is web-based and cross-platform while also providing a modern interface for visualizing sophisticated workflows. Although we wonâ€™t demonstrate all of the cross-platform possibilities in this lab, it's essential to point out that you can also build for iOS, Android, Java (using Ant, Maven, or Gradle), and Linux.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

 -  Create a basic build pipeline from a template.
 -  Track and review a build.
 -  Invoke a continuous integration build.

## Requirements

 -  This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps-supported browser](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).
 -  **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).

## Exercises

During this lab, you'll complete the following exercises:

 -  Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites.
 -  Exercise 1: Introduction to Azure DevOps Build.
