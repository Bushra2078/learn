  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of creating user defined routes in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "To override the default system routes and add more routes to a virtual machine's route table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer describes the purpose of creating custom routes for a virtual machine, not user defined routes for a subnet."
    - content: "To create a new virtual network with a different IP address range"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a new virtual network with a different IP address range is not the purpose of user defined routes."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. User defined routes allow for more control over routing traffic within a subnet, which can help ensure secure and stable application hosting platforms."
  - content: "What is the purpose of a Site to Site (S2S) VPN gateway connection?"
    choices:
    - content: "Allows for a connection over a remote desktop protocol (RDP) session"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RDP is a different protocol used for remote access to a computer."
    - content: "Enables secure connection to a virtual network from an individual client computer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes a Point to Site (P2S) VPN gateway connection."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. S2S connections can be used for cross premises and hybrid configurations, requiring a VPN device located on premises with a public IP address assigned to it."
  - content: "What does Azure Virtual WAN enable?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enables the creation of virtual machines only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Virtual WAN enables more than just the creation of virtual machines."
    - content: "Enables the creation of virtual networks only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Virtual WAN enables more than just the creation of virtual networks."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Virtual WAN enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
  - content: "What is the purpose of environment automation in application hosting platforms?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enables the creation of unstable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Unstable platforms can lead to downtime and security vulnerabilities."
    - content: "Enables manual creation and teardown of environments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manual processes are prone to errors and inconsistencies."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Automation ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors, while validation ensures that the environment meets security and stability requirements."
  - content: "What is the purpose of application security groups in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "To assign network interfaces from different virtual networks to the same group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Network interfaces from different virtual networks cannot be assigned to the same application security group."
    - content: "To limit the number of virtual networks in a subscription"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Application security groups do not limit the number of virtual networks in a subscription."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Application security groups enable the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
