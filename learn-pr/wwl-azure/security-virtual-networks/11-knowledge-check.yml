  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A company is migrating their applications to a PaaS environment. They want to ensure that their security perimeter is strong and secure. Which of the following is a best practice for managing the identity perimeter?"
    choices:
    - content: "Store credentials and secrets in source code or GitHub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Storing credentials and secrets in public code repositories such as GitHub can lead to unauthorized access by attackers."
    - content: "Use network-centric thinking to define the primary security perimeter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Network-centric thinking is less relevant in PaaS environments where broad network access is a key characteristic of cloud computing."
    - content: "Secure keys and credentials using a centralized solution such as Azure Key Vault."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A centralized solution such as Azure Key Vault can safeguard keys and secrets by encrypting them using hardware security modules (HSMs), providing an additional layer of security for PaaS deployments."
  - content: "A company wants to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure. They want to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups. Which Azure feature should they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Network Security Group (NSG)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NSGs are used to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network."
    - content: "Virtual Network Service Endpoints"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual Network Service Endpoints enable you to secure Azure service resources to only your virtual networks."
    - content: "Application Security Groups (ASGs)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. ASGs enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups."
  - content: "A company needs to connect two virtual networks in Azure so that traffic can be routed between them. Which virtual network connection type should they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual network peering"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Virtual network peering connects two Azure virtual networks so that they appear as one for connectivity purposes. Traffic between virtual machines in the peered virtual networks is routed through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, through private IP addresses only. No public internet is involved. This provides a low latency, high bandwidth connection and is useful in scenarios such as cross-region data replication and database failover."
    - content: "Global peering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Global peering is used to peer virtual networks across Azure regions, but it does not provide a direct connection between two virtual networks within the same region."
    - content: "VPN gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A VPN gateway is used to send traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet. While it can also be used to send traffic between Azure virtual networks, it is not the most efficient option for connecting two virtual networks within the same region."
  - content: "A network security group is associated with a virtual machine's network interface. The security rules in the network security group are processed for inbound traffic. If the network security group allows port 80 inbound, which of the following will process the traffic?"
    choices:
    - content: "The security rules in the network security group associated with the network interface"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The security rules in the network security group associated with the network interface are processed first for inbound traffic."
    - content: "The security rules in the network security group associated with the subnet and the network interface"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The security rules in the network security group associated with the network interface are processed first."
    - content: "The security rules in the network security group associated with the subnet"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The security rules in the network security group associated with the network interface are processed first."
  - content: "A company wants to establish network topologies that combine cross premises connectivity with inter virtual network connectivity. Which Azure feature allows them to do this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Virtual Network Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Virtual Network Gateway is used to establish secure, cross-premises connectivity between an on-premises network and Azure."
    - content: "VNet peering"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. VNet peering allows the establishment of network topologies that combine cross premises connectivity with inter virtual network connectivity without using a virtual network gateway."
    - content: "Azure Resource Manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Resource Manager is a deployment model used to manage resources in Azure."
