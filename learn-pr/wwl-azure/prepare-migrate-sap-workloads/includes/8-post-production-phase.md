This post-prodution phase consists of monitoring, operating, and administrating the system. In migration scenarios, from the SAP perspective, the post-production phase involves the same tasks that were part of the operational model in the source environment. Azure-specific tasks include:

- Monitoring and analyzing Azure resource billing 

- Optimizing price/performance ratio of Azure compute and storage resources.

- Minimizing cost by stopping/deallocating Azure VMs, which aren't actively used.
