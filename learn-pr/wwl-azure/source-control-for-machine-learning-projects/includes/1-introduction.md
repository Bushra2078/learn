One important part of **machine learning operations** or **MLOps** is *model reproducibility*. To make a model reproducible, you need to document everything you did to train a model so that anyone can reproduce your steps. 

Next to that, parts of your work may be reusable for other models that need to be trained. It's therefore essential to *centrally manage the code* you write to train a model. By using **source control** (or version control) to manage your code, you can easily save, version, share, and reuse any code you create.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:
