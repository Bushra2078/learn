Follow this guidance for the source export of VLDB systems:

1.  Purge technical tables and unnecessary data. For details, review [SAP Note \#2388483](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2388483).
2.  Separating the R3load processes from the DBMS server is an essential step to maximize export performance.
3.  R3load should run on a fast new Intel CPU. Do not run R3load on UNIX servers as the performance is very poor. Two-socket commodity Intel servers with 128 GB RAM cost little and will save days or weeks of tuning/optimization or consulting time.
4.  Ensure there is a high-speed network, ideally 10 GB with minimal network hops between the source DB server and the Intel R3load servers.
5.  It is recommended to use physical servers for the R3load export servers â€“ virtualized R3load servers at some customer sites did not demonstrate good performance or reliability at extremely high network throughput.
6.  Sequence larger tables to the start of the Orderby.txt.
7.  Configure semi-parallel export/import using signal files.
8.  Large exports will benefit from unsorted export on larger tables. It is important to review the net impact of unsorted exports, as importing unsorted exports to databases that have a clustered index on the primary key will be slower.
9.  Configure Jumbo Frames between source DB server and Intel R3load servers.
10. Adjust memory settings on the source database server to optimize for sequential read/export tasks. For details, review [SAP Note \#936441](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/936441).
