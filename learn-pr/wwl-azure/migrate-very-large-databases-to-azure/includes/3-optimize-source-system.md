Follow this guidance for the source export of VLDB systems:

 -  Purge technical tables and unnecessary data. For details, review [SAP Note \#2388483](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2388483).
 -  Separate the R3load processes from the DBMS server, an essential step to maximize export performance.
 -  R3load should run on a fast new Intel CPU. Do not run R3load on UNIX servers as the performance is very poor. Two-socket commodity Intel servers with 128 GB RAM cost little and will save days or weeks of tuning/optimization or consulting time.
 -  Ensure there is a high-speed network, ideally 10 GB with minimal network hops between the source DB server and the Intel R3load servers.
 -  It is recommended to use physical servers for the R3load export servers â€“ virtualized R3load servers at some customer sites did not demonstrate good performance or reliability at extremely high network throughput.
 -  Sequence larger tables to the start of the Orderby.txt.
 -  Configure semi-parallel export/import using signal files.
 -  Large exports will benefit from unsorted export on larger tables. It is important to review the net impact of unsorted exports, as importing unsorted exports to databases that have a clustered index on the primary key will be slower.
 -  Configure Jumbo Frames between source DB server and Intel R3load servers.
 -  Adjust memory settings on the source database server to optimize for sequential read/export tasks. For details, review [SAP Note \#936441](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/936441).
