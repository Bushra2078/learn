Since the monitoring demands by SAP were specific to SAP applications, Microsoft initially decided not to generically implement the required functionality into Azure, but leave it for customers to deploy the necessary monitoring components and configurations to their Azure VMs. However, deployment and lifecycle management of the monitoring components can be mostly automated by Azure.

The solution developed to enable SAP Monitoring is based on the concept of Azure VM Agent and its extensions. The principle idea behind this concept is to allow (in cases like the Azure Monitoring Extension for SAP), the deployment of special functionality into a VM and the configuration of such software at deployment time. The extension is required for SAP workloads to be supported on Azure VMs.

The 'Azure VM Agent' that enables handling of specific Azure VM Extensions within the VM is injected into Windows VMs by default on VM creation. When VMs are SUSE, Red Hat, or Oracle Linux, the VM agent is already part of the Azure Marketplace image. In the case of custom images, the VM agent must be installed manually.

Any interaction between the Azure Monitoring Extension for SAP and the SAP system takes place via the SAP Host Agent. The Host Agent is a standalone component that does not have a direct dependency on the SAP kernel, which eliminates the need to update it during the SAP system updates.

The SAP monitoring tools SAPOSCOL or SAP Host Agent retrieve Azure VM telemetry via an Azure Monitoring Extension for SAP. This extension allows SAP to collect important performance counters and display those via SAP transactions ST06 and OS07. The extension feeds Azure monitoring statistics into the SAP application for operating system monitoring and DBA Cockpit functions. This data helps to investigate performance issues and provides a basis for capacity planning.

To enable the extension, you can use Az PowerShell (`Set-AzVMAEMExtension`) or Azure CLI (`az vm aem set`). To verify the extension functionality on a Windows Azure VM, you can use the azperflib.exe executable. The output of azperflib.exe shows all populated Azure performance counters for SAP. At the bottom of the list of collected counters, you will find a summary and a health indicator that reflects the status of the Monitoring extension. To verify the extension functionality on a Linux Azure VM, examine the content of the /var/lib/AzrueEnhancedMonitor/PerfCounters file.

You will need to update the SAP monitoring configuration in situations where the joint Microsoft and SAP team extends the monitoring capabilities, resulting in changes to the number and type of performance counters being collected or Microsoft introduces a new version of the underlying Azure infrastructure that delivers the monitoring data. Similarly, an update of the configuration will be required if you change the number of disks attached to the Azure VM hosting the SAP workload, add new network interfaces to it, or change its size. To update the monitoring configuration, repeat the same sequence of steps you used to install the extension in the first place.

## Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions (preview)

To help our customers effectively monitor their SAP on Azure deployments, Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions has been released (in preview at the time of authoring). With this Azure-native monitoring solution, customers running their SAP landscapes on Azure now have access to simplified monitoring, efficient troubleshooting, and flexible customizations.

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is an Azure-native monitoring product for customers, running their SAP landscapes on Azure. The product works with both [SAP on Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-get-started) and [SAP on Azure Large Instances](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture).

With Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions, you can collect telemetry data from your Azure infrastructure and databases in one central location, and visually correlate telemetry data for faster troubleshooting. You can monitor different components of an SAP landscape (such as Azure virtual machines, high-availability clusters, SAP HANA databases etc.) by adding the corresponding provider. Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions monitors SAP HANA network utilization, Linux Network packets in/out, and Network bytes in/out.

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is offered through Azure Marketplace and has a simple, intuitive setup experience. It takes only a few steps to deploy the resource for Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions.

### Supported infrastructure:

 -  Azure virtual machine
 -  Azure Large Instance

### Supported databases:

 -  SAP HANA database
 -  Microsoft SQL Server

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions uses the power of existing Azure Monitor capabilities such as Log Analytics and Workbooks to provide additional monitoring capabilities. Customers can create custom visualizations by editing the default Workbooks provided by Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions, write custom queries, and create custom alerts by using Azure Log Analytics workspace, take advantage of a flexible retention period and connect monitoring data with their ticketing system.
