In this exercise you'll create a console app to perform the following operations in Azure Cosmos DB:

* Connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account
* Create a database
* Create a container

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.com/free](https://azure.com/free).
* **Visual Studio Code**: You can install Visual Studio Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* **Azure CLI**: You can install the Azure CLI from [https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* The **.NET Core 3.1 SDK**, or **.NET 5.0 SDK**. You can install from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Setting up

Perform the following actions to prepare Azure, and your local environment, for the exercise.

### Connecting to Azure

1. Start Visual Studio Code and open a terminal window by selecting **Terminal** from the top application bar, then choosing **New Terminal**.

1. Log in to Azure by using the command below. A browser window should open letting you choose which account to log in with.

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

### Create resources in Azure

1. Create a resource group for the resources needed for this exercise. Replace `<myLocation>` with a region near you.

    ```bash
    az group create --location <myLocation> --name az204-cosmos-rg
    ```

1. Create the Azure Comsos DB account. Replace `<myCosmosDBacct>` with a *unique* name to identify your Azure Cosmos account. The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character. It must be between 3-31 characters in length. *This command will take a few minutes to complete.*

    ```bash
    az cosmosdb create --name <myCosmosDBacct> --resource-group az204-cosmos-rg
    ```

    Record the `documentEndpoint` shown in the JSON response, it will be used below.

1. Retrieve the primary key for the account by  using the command below. Record the `primaryMasterKey` from the command results it will be used in the code below.

     ```bash
    # Retrieve the primary key
    az cosmosdb keys list --name <myCosmosDBacct> --resource-group az204-cosmos-rg
    ```

### Set up the console application

Now that the needed resources are deployed to Azure the next step is to set up the console application using the same terminal window in Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a folder for the project and change in to the folder.

    ```bash
    md az204-cosmos
    cd az204-cosmos
    ```

1. Create the .NET console app.

    ```bash
    dotnet new console
    ```

1. Open the current folder in VS Code using the command below. The `-r` option will open the folder without launching a new VS Code window.

    ```bash
    code . -r
    ```

1. Select the *Program.cs* file in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

## Build the console app

It's time to start adding the packages and code to the project.

### Add packages and using statements

1. Open the terminal in VS Code and use the command below to add the `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` package to the project.

    ```bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos
    ```

1. Add using statements to include `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` and to enable async operations.

    ```csharp
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;
    ```

### Add code to connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account

1. Replace the entire `class Program` with the code snippet below. The code snippet adds constants and variables into the class and adds some error checking. Be sure to replace the placeholder values for `EndpointUri` and `PrimaryKey` following the directions in the code comments.

    ```csharp
    public class Program
    {
        // Replace <documentEndpoint> with the information created earlier
        private static readonly string EndpointUri = "<documentEndpoint>";

        // Set variable to the Primary Key from earlier.
        private static readonly string PrimaryKey = "<your primary key>";

        // The Cosmos client instance
        private CosmosClient cosmosClient;

        // The database we will create
        private Database database;

        // The container we will create.
        private Container container;

        // The names of the database and container we will create
        private string databaseId = "az204Database";
        private string containerId = "az204Container";

        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Beginning operations...\n");
                Program p = new Program();
                await p.CosmosAsync();
    
            }
            catch (CosmosException de)
            {
                Exception baseException = de.GetBaseException();
                Console.WriteLine("{0} error occurred: {1}", de.StatusCode, de);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error: {0}", e);
            }
            finally
            {
                Console.WriteLine("End of program, press any key to exit.");
                Console.ReadKey();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Below the `Main` method, add a new asynchronous task called `CosmosAsync`, which instantiates our new `CosmosClient`. 

    ```csharp
    public async Task CosmosAsync()
    {
        // Create a new instance of the Cosmos Client
        this.cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(EndpointUri, PrimaryKey);
    }
    ```

## Create a database

1. Copy and paste the `CreateDatabaseAsync` method after the  `CosmosAsync` method. `CreateDatabaseAsync` creates a new database with ID `az204Database` if it doesn't already exist.

    ```csharp
    private async Task CreateDatabaseAsync()
    {
        // Create a new database using the cosmosClient
        this.database = await this.cosmosClient.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseId);
        Console.WriteLine("Created Database: {0}\n", this.database.Id);
    }
    ```

1. Add the code below at the end of the `CosmosAsync` method, it calls the `CreateDatabaseAsync` method you just added.

    ```csharp
        // Runs the CreateDatabaseAsync method
        await this.CreateDatabaseAsync();
    ```

## Create a container

1. Copy and paste the `CreateContainerAsync` method below the `CreateDatabaseAsync` method.

    ```csharp
    private async Task CreateContainerAsync()
    {
        // Create a new container
        this.container = await this.database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(containerId, "/LastName");
        Console.WriteLine("Created Container: {0}\n", this.container.Id);
    }
    ```

1. Copy and paste the code below where you instantiated the `CosmosClient` to call the **CreateContainer** method you just added.

    ```csharp
    // Run the CreateContainerAsync method
    await this.CreateContainerAsync();
    ```

## Run the application

1. Save your work and, in a terminal in VS Code, run the `dotnet run` command. The console will display the following messages.

    ```bash
    Beginning operations...
    
    Created Database: az204Database
    
    Created Container: az204Container
    
    End of program, press any key to exit.
    ```

1. You can verify the results by opening the Azure portal, navigating to your Azure Cosmos DB resource, and use the **Data Explorer** to view the database and container.

## Clean up Azure resources

You can now safely delete the *az204-cosmos-rg* resource group from your account by running the command below.

```bash
az group delete --name az204-cosmos-rg --no-wait
```
