Azure IoT Edge gateway devices can be configured to support complex device-side architectures.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to implement an Azure IoT Edge device-side architecture as part of the solution. You decide to gain experience by implementing the IoT Edge transparent gateway pattern within a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:

 -  Deploy an Azure IoT Edge Enabled Linux VM as an IoT Edge Device.
 -  Configure the IoT Edge device as a transparent gateway and connect it to IoT Hub.
 -  Configure the IoT Edge gateway device for communication with downstream IoT devices.
 -  Create a downstream IoT device and configure its connection to the gateway device.

By the end of this module, you will be able to configure a device-side architecture that implements the IoT Edge transparent gateway pattern.
