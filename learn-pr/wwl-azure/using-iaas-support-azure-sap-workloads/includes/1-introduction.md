Microsoft Azure enables companies to acquire compute and storage resources in minimal time without lengthy procurement cycles. Azure Virtual Machine service allows companies to deploy classical applications, like SAP NetWeaver based applications into Azure and extend their reliability and availability without having further resources available on-premises. Azure Virtual Machine Services also supports cross-premises connectivity, which enables companies to actively integrate Azure Virtual Machines into their on-premises domains, their Private Clouds and their SAP System Landscape. 

This module describes the essentials of Microsoft Azure virtual machines and provides a walk-through of planning and implementation considerations for SAP installations in Azure. The module complements the SAP Installation Documentation and SAP Notes, which represent the primary resources for installations and deployments of SAP software on given platforms.
