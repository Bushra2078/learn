Azure Automation runbooks are provided to help eliminate the time it takes to build custom solutions.

The runbooks have already been built by Microsoft and the Microsoft community.

You can use them with or without modification.

Also, you can import runbooks from the runbook gallery at the Microsoft Script Center, Script resources for IT professionals webpage.

> [!NOTE]
> A new Azure PowerShell module was released in December 2018, called the **Az** PowerShell module. It replaces the **AzureRM** PowerShell module and is now the intended PowerShell module for interacting with Azure. This new **Az** module is currently supported in Azure Automation. For more general details on the new Az PowerShell module, go to [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).
