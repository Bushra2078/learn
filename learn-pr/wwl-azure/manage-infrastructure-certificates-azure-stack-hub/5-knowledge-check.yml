  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An Azure Stack Hub operator wants to deploy an Azure Stack Hub system using an Azure Active Directory identity provider. They acquire the certificates for the deployment, and want to make sure that the certificates meet the prerequisites for Azure Stack Hub. Which PowerShell cmdlet should they run?"
    choices:
    - content: "Invoke-AzsHubDeploymentCertificateValidation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To check the output and ensure that all certificates pass all tests, you run the PowerShell cmdlet Invoke-AzsHubDeploymentCertificateValidation to validate readiness."
    - content: "Setting up your own datacenter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To validate certificates for other Azure Stack Hub services, change the value for -CertificateType in Invoke-AzsHubDBAdapterCertificateValidation."
    - content: "Get-PfxCertificate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Get-PfxCertificate cmdlet gets an object representing each specified PFX certificate file. A PFX file includes both the certificate and a private key."
  - content: "While monitoring an Azure Stack Hub system, an Azure Stack Hub operator notices an alert for an external certificate that will expire. They acquire new certificates. They want to validate that the certificates are in a healthy state, and then renew the certificates. Which three actions should they perform?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run New-RegistrationToken cmdlet and specify UsageReportingEnabled."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Running New-RegistrationToken creates a new registration token."
    - content: "Run the Register-DirectoryService cmdlet and specify the -CustomADAdminCredential parameter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Running the Register-DirectoryService cmdlet registers customer Active Directory (Azure AD) with Graph Service."
    - content: "Run the Test-AzureStack cmdlet and specify the -Group UpdateReadiness parameter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You should copy the certificates to a file share that is accessible from the privileged endpoint (PEP), run the Test-AzureStack cmdlet and specify the -Group SecretRotationReadiness parameter, and run the Start-SecretRotation and specify the PfxFilePath parameter."
    - content: "Copy the certificates to a file share that is accessible from the privileged endpoint (PEP), run the Test-AzureStack cmdlet and specify the -Group SecretRotationReadiness parameter, and run the Start-SecretRotation and specify the PfxFilePath parameter."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct.
