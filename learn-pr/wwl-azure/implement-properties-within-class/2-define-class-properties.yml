quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Why is it a best practice to access variables through a property instead of accessing them directly?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because accessing variables through properties isn't allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can create public variables in your objects that can be accessed by other objects, but it isn't recommended."
    - content: "Because it gives you more time to spend on other tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating properties doesn't save you time, it makes your code cleaner."
    - content: "Because it allows you to hide the contents of your object that isn't intended to be accessed outside of your object, encapsulating private members."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Encapsulation is a best practice because it makes your code cleaner by hiding the things in your classes that shouldn't be used externally."
  - content: "What would be an example of a property for a House class?"
    choices:
    - content: "A property that allows you to send messages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is too vague and doesn't provide any reasoning for the answer given."
    - content: "A property that allows you to set and get the wallpaper in a room."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A property that allows you to select a wallpaper for a room is more appropriate for a room, not a house."
    - content: "A property that allows you to set and get the color of the house."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Houses are painted a color and a property that allows you to set and get the color is appropriate for a house class."
