Properties are a convenient way to get simple data in and out of your classes.

Suppose you have created a House class that represents a house in your application. Your House class has a constructor that has two initialization parameters, the name of the style of the house and the square footage of the house. Now another object that is accessing the public, or visible, methods and properties of your House class needs to access that data. To do that, you can use properties.

Each object you create represents the class it was based on. And each object has variables of different types, such as int, string, double and so on. These variables, including the properties and methods of an object, are sometimes referred to as the members of an object.  They hold the contents, or "state," information for the object. You can modify the state of your objects by adding properties to your classes that access these variables.

Properties in your class allow you to store and retrieve information from your objects. In this lesson, you will see how the house style and square footage variables are created and modified using properties that encapsulate them.
