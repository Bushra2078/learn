  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following replicates data to a secondary region, maintains six copies of the data, and is the default replication option? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "Locally-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times within a single data center in the primary region."
    - content: "Read-access geo-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Read-access geo-redundant storage (GRS) is the default replication option. Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region."
    - content: "Zone-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your Azure Storage data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region."
  - content: "The name of a storage account must be:"
    choices:
    - content: "Unique within the containing resource group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect."
    - content: "Unique within your Azure subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect."
    - content: "Globally unique."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The storage account name is used as part of the URI for API access, so it must be globally unique."
  - content: "A manufacturing company has several sensors that record time-relative data. Only the most recent data is useful. The company wants the lowest cost storage for this data. What is the best kind of storage account for them?"
    choices:
    - content: "Locally-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This option is the best because it's the lowest cost, the data is being continuously created, and data loss isn't an issue."
    - content: "Geo-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That' incorrect. Can you think of a lower cost solution for temporary data?"
    - content: "Zone-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That' incorrect. Can you think of a lower cost solution for temporary data?"
