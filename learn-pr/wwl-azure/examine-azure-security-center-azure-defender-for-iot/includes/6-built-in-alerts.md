Azure Defender for IoT continuously analyzes your IoT solution using advanced analytics and threat intelligence to alert you to malicious activity. In addition built-in alerts, you can create custom alerts based on your knowledge of expected behaviors. An alert acts as an indicator of potential compromise, and should be investigated and remediated.

The following list of built-in alerts can be triggered on your IoT Hub.

    New certificate added to an IoT Hub.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    A certificate named '%\{DescCertificateName\}' was added to IoT Hub '%\{DescIoTHubName\}'. If this action was made by an unauthorized party, it may indicate malicious activity.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    1. Make sure the certificate was added by an authorized party.
2. If it was not added by an authorized party, remove the certificate and escalate the alert to the organizational security team.

    Certificate deleted from an IoT Hub.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    A certificate named '%\{DescCertificateName\}' was deleted from IoT Hub '%\{DescIoTHubName\}'. If this action was made by an unauthorized party, it may indicate a malicious activity.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    1. Make sure the certificate was removed by an authorized party.
2. If the certificate was not removed by an authorized party, add the certificate back, and escalate the alert to the organizational security team.

    Unsuccessful attempt detected to add a certificate to an IoT Hub.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    There was an unsuccessful attempt to add certificate '%\{DescCertificateName\}' to IoT Hub '%\{DescIoTHubName\}'. If this action was made by an unauthorized party, it may indicate malicious activity.

Diagnostic settings enable you to recreate activity trails for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or your network is compromised. If this action was not made by an authorized party, it may indicate malicious activity.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    1. Make sure the certificate was removed by an authorized party.
