  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following choices isn't a scenario that App Configuration makes it easier to implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Centralize management and distribution of hierarchical configuration data for different environments and geographies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. App Configuration makes it easier to implement the following scenarios, Centralize management and distribution of hierarchical configuration data for different environments and geographies. Dynamically change application settings without the need to redeploy or restart an application. Control feature availability in real-time."
    - content: "Dynamically change application settings without the need to redeploy or restart an application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. App Configuration makes it easier to implement the following scenarios, Centralize management and distribution of hierarchical configuration data for different environments and geographies.

    - content: "Create, manage and centralize packages as a Package Management."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. App Configuration makes it easier to implement the following scenarios, Centralize management and distribution of hierarchical configuration data for different environments and geographies. Dynamically change application settings without the need to redeploy or restart an application. Control feature availability in real-time."
  - content: "Which of the following choices isn't a general approach to naming keys used for configuration data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cross-key."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. There are two general approaches, Flat and Hierarchical."
