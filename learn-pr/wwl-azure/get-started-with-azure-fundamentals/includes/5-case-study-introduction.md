Our case study shows how using Azure and cloud computing can help Contoso, while providing guidance to your projects.  Contoso, Ltd. is a company that carries a unique line of products and the company is growing rapidly.  They've moved from a local-startup business to a nationwide business in just a few years, and they want to grow worldwide.  All of their current infrastructure is in on-premises data centers, and growth has been a challenge. The process of evaluating which hardware to buy, which projects/programs to invest money and data center resources into is slowing down the decision making and potential growth. Contoso, Ltd. is looking to the cloud and Azure for some solutions.

Contoso's growth plans are a massive project that they're hoping will span much of the world, and not be limited to only a few countries. Additionally, growth is going to take infrastructure, and the computers they'll use have the potential for a large capital expense cost and variable usage. Finally, Contoso knows from historical data that people adopt their products and services in waves. Contoso needs enough systems available to onboard their new customers, but they don't want them to cost money while expanding into each country.

With this planned growth, Contoso, Ltd. is faced with some very common questions.  The most common is, how do we make the best use of the dollars that we spend on computing hardware and software every day.

## The case study experience 

Across this learning path and within others for the Azure Fundamentals training, we'll use Contoso, Ltd. as a way to demonstrate how Azure (and cloud computing) can ensure that company growth (and addition of new capabilities) runs smoothly and stays at optimal cost.
