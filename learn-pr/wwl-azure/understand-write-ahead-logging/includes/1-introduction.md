PostgreSQL is an ACID-compliant database (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability). Durability means that any changes to the database are not lost, even if there's a power cut or a disk fails. PostgreSQL does this using write ahead logging (WAL). 

In this module you will learn how PostgreSQL prevents data loss using the write ahead log.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Describe write ahead logging.
- Understand replication and logical decoding.
