In this module, we'll look at two common administrative tasks done on an Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB account, replication and monitoring. While replication would be a task we might not modify regularly, monitoring will be a task that will be performed all the time. We'll also introduce consistency levels, to understand when our data will be accessible in a replicated environment.
