In this module, we explored the powerful capabilities of Azure Network Security Group (NSG) for filtering network traffic and enforcing access controls in Azure environments. We learned how NSGs can be created and configured to allow or deny specific types of traffic based on source, destination, and port. By utilizing NSGs, organizations can enhance network security, restrict unauthorized access, and enforce network security best practices. We also discussed the prioritization of NSG rules and the utilization of NSG flow logs for monitoring and troubleshooting network traffic. By leveraging Azure NSG, organizations can maintain a secure and reliable network infrastructure in the cloud.
