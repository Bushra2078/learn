- **Real-time inventory tracking.** The company website updates product availability only once a night. The company would like the inventory updated as products are ordered. This means updating the database and if necessary, sending reorder notifications. The current program is a Windows service that's written in C#.

- **Migrate the data center virtual machines**. The companyâ€™s data center virtual machines host relational database servers. These machines are used for online orders. The company would like to move this capability to the cloud.
