  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Which compute option is best to support the company’s real-time inventory tracking requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Logic Apps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to implement the same logic in Azure Logic Apps. However, because the team has already invested time in building the service in C#, it can use the same code in an Azure function."
    - content: "Azure Functions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Tailwind Traders developers’ team has already written the logic in C#. It would make sense to copy the relevant C# code from the Windows service and port it to an Azure function. The developers would bind the function to trigger each time a new message appears on a specific queue."
    - content: "Azure virtual machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deploying virtual machines would not be the best solution."
  - content: "Which type of virtual machine is best for the data center migration requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "General purpose"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. General-purpose VMs are designed to have a balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers."
    - content: "Compute optimized"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Compute optimized VMs are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio. Suitable for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers."
    - content: "Memory optimized"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Memory optimized VMs are designed to have a high memory-to-CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics."
  - content: "What compute solution is best for hosting the company’s data processing app?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Container Instances"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This is an ideal use for containers. The company will achieve significant cost saving through per-second billing."
    - content: "Azure virtual machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Provisioning virtual machines would be more expensive and underutilized."
    - content: "Azure web apps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Web apps are better for hosted web applications."
