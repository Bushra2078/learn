  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the best definition of a console application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Declares an explicitly typed int variable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The var keyword creates an implicitly typed variable"
    - content: "Casts the operands to prevent truncating the result"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The operands are casted to the int data type that will truncate the result"
    - content: "Casts the operands to truncate the result"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The operands are casted to the int data type that will create an implicitly typed int result"
  - content: "What does the following line of code do? `if (ant.I < 0 || ant.J < 0 || ant.J >= Size || ant.I >= Size)`"
    choices:
    - content: "Make sure that there isn't more than one ant"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line of code has nothing to do with the number of ants on the grid"
    - content: "Make sure that the ant is of a particular size"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line of code has nothing to do with the size of an ant"
    - content: "Make sure that an ant is within the grid (I and J represent the lower and upper bound x, y coordinates)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This line of code is checking to see if an ant is still on the grid"
  - content: "Why did we use the Langton Ant project as an exercise?"
    choices:
    - content: "To learn something about Alan Turing and the universal Turing machine"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although you may do your own research on Alan Turing, he was not the only reason for this exercise"
    - content: "To learn about the Langton Ant project"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although we did use Langton's Ant for this exercise, the purpose of the exercise was not only to learn about Langton's Ant"
    - content: "To learn about how to create and use classes, methods, and properties"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although close, this exercise was not solely about the previously mentioned aspects of object-oriented programming"
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This exercise was about all three: Alan Turing, Langton's Ant, and how to code a fun project using your newly acquired skills"
