You're using the VS Code Editor as your code development environment. You create a console application and write code to create a class with a constructor, properties, and that reads user input.

## Project overview

You're developing an application that demonstrates Langton’s Ants, an application based on mathematician Alan Turing’s invention of what has come to be called a universal Turing machine. As part of the demonstration of the computation logic Mr. Turing came up with, using inputs from the grid, you create an ant and ant movement rules. From a logic standpoint, Mr. Turing's universal machine is still used as a model for how computers work today.

The application simulates ants on a grid and their movements. Along the way, you create classes, methods, and properties that model your application.

A few things to keep in mind.

- Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white
- You arbitrarily identify one square as the "ant"
- The ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes

The "ant" moves according to these rules:

- At a white square, turn 90° clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
- At a black square, turn 90° counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
