When using private DNS zones, you can use your own custom domain names rather than the Azure-provided names. Using custom domain names helps you to tailor your virtual network architecture to best suit your organization's needs. It provides name resolution for virtual machines (VMs) within a virtual network and between virtual networks. Additionally, you can configure zones names with a split-horizon view, which allows a private and a public DNS zone to share the name.

The DNS records for the private zone are not viewable or retrievable. But, the DNS records are registered and will resolve successfully.

## Azure Private DNS benefits

 -  **Removes the need for custom DNS solutions**. Previously, many customers created custom DNS solutions to manage DNS zones in their virtual network. You can now perform DNS zone management by using the native Azure infrastructure. This removes the burden of creating and managing custom DNS solutions.
 -  **Use all common DNS records types**. Azure DNS supports A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, PTR, SOA, SRV, and TXT records.
 -  **Automatic hostname record management**. Along with hosting your custom DNS records, Azure automatically maintains hostname records for the VMs in the specified virtual networks. In this scenario, you can optimize the domain names you use without needing to create custom DNS solutions or modify applications.
 -  **Hostname resolution between virtual networks**. Unlike Azure-provided host names, private DNS zones can be shared between virtual networks. This capability simplifies cross-network and service-discovery scenarios, such as virtual network peering.
 -  **Familiar tools and user experience**. To reduce the learning curve, this new offering uses well-established Azure DNS tools (PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates, and the REST API).
 -  **Split-horizon DNS support**. With Azure DNS, you can create zones with the same name that resolve to different answers from within a virtual network and from the public internet. A typical scenario for split-horizon DNS is to provide a dedicated version of a service for use inside your virtual network.
 -  **Available in all Azure regions**. The Azure DNS private zones feature is available in all Azure regions in the Azure public cloud.
