Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

In this module, you reviewed features and usage cases for domains, custom domains, and private zones. You learned how to verify custom domain names by using DNS records. You explored how to implement DNS zones, DNS delegation, and DNS record sets.
