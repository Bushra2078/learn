## Lab scenario

In this unit, you'll configure DNS name resolution and create a private DNS zone. You'll link the VNets for registration and resolution, and then create two virtual machines and test the configuration.

## Architecture

## Objectives

**Task 1**: Create a private DNS Zone.

**Task 2**: Link subnet for auto registration.

**Task 3**: Create Virtual Machines to test the configuration.

- Use a template to create the virtual machines. You can [review the lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M01/azuredeploy.json).
- Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template.

**Task 4**: Verify records are present in the DNS zone.
