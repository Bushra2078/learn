**Reservations** help you save money by paying ahead. You can pay for one-year or three-years of virtual machine, SQL Database compute capacity, Azure Cosmos DB throughput, or other Azure resources. Pre-paying allows you to get a discount on the resources you use. Reservations can significantly reduce your virtual machine, SQL database compute, Azure Cosmos DB, or other resource costs up to 72% on pay-as-you-go prices. Reservations provide a billing discount and don't affect the runtime state of your resources.

**Azure Hybrid Benefits** is a pricing benefit for customers who have licenses with Software Assurance. Azure Hybrid Benefits helps maximize the value of existing on-premises Windows Server or SQL Server license investments when migrating to Azure. There's an Azure Hybrid Benefit Savings Calculator to help you determine your savings.

**Azure Credits** is monthly credit benefit that allows you to experiment with, develop, and test new solutions on Azure. For example, as a Visual Studio subscriber, you can use Microsoft Azure at no extra charge. With your monthly Azure credit, Azure is your personal sandbox for dev/test.

**Azure regions** pricing can vary from one region to another, even in the US. Double check the pricing in various regions to see if you can save a little.

**Budgets** help you plan for and drive organizational accountability. With budgets, you can account for the Azure services you consume or subscribe to during a specific period. They help you inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs, and to monitor how spending progresses over time. When the budget thresholds you've created are exceeded, only notifications are triggered. None of your resources are affected and your consumption isn't stopped. You can use budgets to compare and track spending as you analyze costs.

**Pricing Calculator**:

The [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) provides estimates in all areas of Azure including compute, networking, storage, web, and databases.
