  questions:
  - content: "The company financial comptroller wants to be notified whenever the company is half-way to spending the money allocated for cloud services. Which of the following is the best approach to meeting this requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure reservation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Reservations helps save money by committing to one-year or three-year plans for multiple products."
    - content: "Create a budget and a spending threshold."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Create a budget and a spending threshold. Billing Alerts will help monitor and manage billing activity for your Azure accounts. Budget thresholds can be evaluated and will be reset automatically at the end of a period."
    - content: "Create a management group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure management groups provide a way for an organization to control and manage access, compliance, and policies for their subscription within their tenant."
  - content: "The company financial comptroller wants to identify which billing department each Azure resource belongs to. Which of the following is the best approach to meeting this requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Track resource usage in a spreadsheet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This form of tracking is manual and prone to errors. Is there a more automated way to track resource usage?"
    - content: "Split the deployment into separate Azure subscriptions, where each subscription belongs to its own billing department."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although  subscriptions can provide separate billing by department, is there another method that allows all resources to stay within the same subscription?"
    - content: "Apply a tag to each resource that includes the associated billing department."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. The team might create a tag that's named BillingDept whose value would be the name of the billing department. Azure policy ensures that the proper tags are assigned when resources are provisioned."
  - content: "Which of the following preserves data residency and offers comprehensive compliance and resiliency options?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Active Directory Account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An Azure AD account is an identity created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service."
    - content: "Regions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers."
    - content: "Subscriptions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that is linked to an Azure account."
