Azure Monitor lets you visualize, query, route, archive, and take other actions on metrics and logs coming from resources in Azure. Azure Monitor on Azure Stack Hub provides base-level infrastructure metrics and logs for most services. You can work with this data by using the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal, Monitor PowerShell Cmdlets, Cross-Platform CLI, or Azure Monitor REST APIs. Monitoring data is found with the Azure Monitor pipeline, just like Azure Monitor in global Azure.
