    - content: "SDKs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, CLIs."
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "A person opens the Azure Cloud Shell, ensures that Bash is selected as the environment, and then runs the following two commands: \"az group create --name MyAZ220RG --location westus\" and \"az iot hub create --resource-group MyAZ220RG --name MyIotHub\". Which of the following statements is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "The first command will fail to create a resource group because no subscription is provided."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The command will succeed using the subscription associated with the Azure Cloud Shell instance."
    - content: "The first command will create a resource group named MyAZ220RG in the westus region."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The command will succeed, using the resource group name and location provided."
    - content: "The second command will fail because no pricing tier is specified."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The --sku parameter that sets the pricing tier is not required. The default value of F1 (free) will be applied when the parameter is not specified. There is a limit of one free tier IoT Hub per subscription, so running the command a second time will generate an exception even if the other parameters are changed."
