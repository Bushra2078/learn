The Microsoft Azure IoT device SDKs include lots of useful tools and information. The included code samples can help developers to build applications that interact with Azure IoT Hub services.

## Coding language support

Depending on the IoT scenario and your developer experience, you may have a preferred language or platform. The SDKs got you covered. Support for various platforms, languages, and protocols allows you to develop in your preferred environment. Five languages are currently supported: C, C\#, Java, Node.js, and Python. APIs are consistent across the five languages, as much as language-specific constructs allow.

Each language has a public GitHub repo that includes sample code and documentation. The SDKs are also available as binary packages. You can choose from NuGet for C\#, Maven for Java, apt-get for some Linux Distributions, npm for Node.js, and pip for Python.

## Platform testing

The SDKs are regularly tested on the following platforms (when languages apply):

 -  Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian)
 -  Windows
 -  MBED
 -  Arduino (Huzzah, ThingDev, FeatherM0), FreeRTOS (ESP32, ESP8266)
 -  .NETFramework 4.5, UWP, PCL (Profile 7 â€“ UWP, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android), .NetMicroFramework, .NetStandard 1.3
 -  Intel Edison

## Supported protocols

IoT Hub allows devices to use the following protocols for device-side communications:

 -  MQTT
 -  MQTT over WebSockets
 -  AMQP
 -  AMQP over WebSockets
 -  HTTPS
