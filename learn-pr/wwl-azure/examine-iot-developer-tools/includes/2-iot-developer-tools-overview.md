Microsoft offers a comprehensive set of development tools for any developer (using any platform or language) to deliver IoT and other cloud applications. You can develop your IoT solution with the language of your choice using a range of SDKs and take advantage of full-featured integrated development environments (IDEs) and editors with advanced debugging capabilities and built-in Azure support.

The primary developer tool categories for Azure IoT include:

 -  SDKs: Download and install language-specific SDKs and tools for your platform of choice, including .NET, Java, Node.js, and Python.
 -  Visual Studio: Get all the power and capabilities you need to easily develop, debug, deploy, manage, and diagnose cloud-scale applications on Azure, using a full-featured IDE.
 -  Visual Studio Code: Edit and debug code quickly with a lightweight code editor that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
 -  CLIs: Use a cross-platform command-line interface to create and manage services and automate everyday tasks in Azure.
