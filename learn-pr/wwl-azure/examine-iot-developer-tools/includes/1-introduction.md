The Azure IoT SDKs and coding tool extensions provide everything that you need to develop an Azure IoT solution.

Suppose you have joined a team that will be implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Each Azure IoT solution uses the software language and coding tool options that are best suited to the existing IT infrastructure of the business and the development team. You decide to examine the supported development options, the Azure IoT SDKs, and the coding environments.

In this module, you will:

 -  Review the developer tool options.
 -  Examine the Azure IoT SDKs for devices and services.
 -  Examine the Visual Studio Code, Azure CLI, and Cloud Shell coding environments.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the Azure IoT SDKs and the coding environments that you can implement.
