  - content: "A company wants to improve their compliance posture by resolving failing assessments directly within the dashboard. What are the steps they should follow to remediate an automated assessment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Select a particular resource to view more details and resolve the recommendation for that resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is one of the steps to remediate an automated assessment, but it isn't the first step."
    - content: "Select a manual assessment to expand it and view the details for that recommendation."

      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer describes the steps to remediate a manual assessment, not an automated assessment."
    - content: "Select a regulatory compliance standard, select a compliance control to expand it, select any of the failing assessments that appear in the dashboard to view the details for that recommendation, select a particular resource to view more details and resolve the recommendation for that resource."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These are the steps to remediate an automated assessment.
