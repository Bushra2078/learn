Version control and source control are essential practices in DevOps, enabling continuous integration and infrastructure as code.

In our scenario, the organization is transitioning to a distributed version control model like Git, particularly for using GitHub for software lifecycle management. Understanding the principles and benefits of version and source control is crucial for this transition. Git allows for tracking changes, reviewing history, creating branches, merging branches, collaborating with multiple developers, and automating processes like continuous integration and deployment. Git terminology includes concepts like working tree, repository, clone, commit, branch, merge, remote, pull, push, fetch, and pull request. GitHub is a cloud-based service that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration features.

The topics covered in this module include: 
- Version control and source control principles 
- Introduction to Git and its terminology 
- Using GitHub for hosting Git repositories and collaboration 
- Understanding the GitHub flow for managing updates to projects 
- Continuous integration and its role in DevOps 
- Shift-left testing strategy and its different types 
- Shift-left security and integrating security into the software lifecycle

The goal of this module is to provide learners with an understanding of version control and source control principles, the usage of Git and GitHub for managing software development projects, the importance of continuous integration, and the shift-left approach for testing and security in DevOps.
