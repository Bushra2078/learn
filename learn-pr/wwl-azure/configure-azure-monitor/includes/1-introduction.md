Logging and monitoring the health of your services is a vital component of production applications. Azure Administrators determine the causes of failures and try to identify any problems before they occur.

Azure Monitor is an important tool to help you in this process. It enables you to gather monitoring and diagnostic information about the health of your services. You can use this information to visualize and analyze the causes of problems that might occur in your app.

In this module, suppose you work for the operations team of a global organization. The organization is running large-scale production apps in the cloud. The operations team wants to consolidate its log data in a single service to improve visibility across services and simplify its logging strategy. You're responsible for preparing a configuration plan to implement Azure Monitor to track the health of the applications.
