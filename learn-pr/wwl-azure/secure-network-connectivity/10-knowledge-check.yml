    choices:
    - content: "Azure Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  This is a tool to store directory items for use with authentication and authorization, it does not look at IP addresses."
    - content: "Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Azure Firewall grants server access based on the originating IP address of each request. You create firewall rules that specify ranges of IP addresses. Only clients from these granted IP addresses will be allowed to access the server. Firewall rules also include specific network protocol and port information."
    - content: "VPN Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  A VPN is a dedicated connection between two points, but does not look at the originating IP address to grant access."
  - content: "Which of the following services would filter internet traffic in an Azure virtual network?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  A firewall works before the request gets to the virtual network."
    - content: "Network Security Group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. NSGs allow you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. An NSG can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that enable you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol."
    - content: "VPN Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A VPN is a dedicated connection between two points, but does not filter traffic."
