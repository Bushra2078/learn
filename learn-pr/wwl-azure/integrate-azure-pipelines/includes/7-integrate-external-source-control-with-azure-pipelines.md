**Estimated time:** 60 minutes.

**Lab files:** none.

## Scenario

With the introduction of Azure DevOps, Microsoft offers developers a new continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) service called Azure Pipelines that enables you to build continuously, test, and deploy to any platform or cloud. It has cloud-hosted agents for Linux, macOS, and Windows; powerful workflows with native container support; and flexible deployments to Kubernetes, VMs, and serverless environments.

Azure Pipelines provides unlimited CI/CD minutes and 10 parallel jobs to every GitHub open source project for free. All open source projects run on the same infrastructure that our paying customers to use. That means you’ll have the same fast performance and high quality of service. Many of the top open source projects are already using Azure Pipelines for CI/CD, such as Atom, CPython, Pipenv, Tox, Visual Studio Code, and TypeScript-and the list is growing every day.

You’ll see how easy it's to set up Azure Pipelines with your GitHub projects in this lab. Also, how you can start seeing benefits immediately.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

 -  Install Azure Pipelines from the GitHub Marketplace.
 -  Integrate a GitHub project with an Azure Pipeline.
 -  Tracks pull requests through the pipeline.

## Requirements

 -  This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps-supported browser](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).
 -  **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
 -  If you don't already have a GitHub account that you can use for this lab, follow the instructions available at [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

## Exercises

During this lab, you'll complete the following exercises:

 -  Exercise 1: Getting started with Azure Pipelines.
