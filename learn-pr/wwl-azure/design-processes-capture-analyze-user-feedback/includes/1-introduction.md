"People are talking about you and your competitors constantly. They could be asking for help, complaining about a bug, or raving about how much they love you. And you want to stay on top of all those conversations.

Your customers' opinions matter not just to PR &amp; marketing but also every team – from customer support to product development to sales.

But sifting through irrelevant posts on multiple channels is overwhelming and can be a huge time drain.

Sometimes it's not even possible when they don't tag or link to you.

That's where scanning tools come in. Scanning tools make it easy for you to find people talking about you, but not necessarily to you (when they don't @mention your account) - and reach out or take notes when necessary.

There are so many business opportunities to uncover if you know where to look."

Although there isn't a specific survey question you can ask, it's essential to get a general pulse on what your customers are saying over time about your company. Here are the pros and cons:

Customer feedback doesn't come in through your site's contact form – it's everywhere.

You only must search the Twitter handle of any product with more than a few hundred users to see that customers love to offer their opinion – positive and negative.

It's helpful to monitor it and learn from it, but casually collecting feedback on an ad-hoc basis isn't enough.

Startups thrive on feedback about their 'North star' and are constantly evolving based on what their customers request, break, and complain about.

Enterprises also can't overlook the fact that customers make any company tick and must struggle harder than startups to stay relevant and innovate.<br>

So, if you're collecting feedback 'as and when it comes in, you're missing data that's as important as page views or engagement.

It's like deciding not to bother setting up Google Analytics on your homepage or not properly configuring your CRM; in the end, you're choosing not to benefit from data that will have a transformative effect on your product strategy.

With a dataset of feedback – whether that's from customer reviews, support tickets, or social media – you can dig into the words your customers are using to describe certain parts of your product and get insights into what they like and what they don't like.<br>

Here's the kind of result you can get with this.<br>

As the saying goes, "For every customer who bothers to complain, 20 other customers remain silent."

Unless the experience is bad, customers usually don't bother to share feedback about an experience that didn't meet their expectations. Instead, they decide never to do business with the service provider again. That's a high price to pay for lost feedback.<br>

An excellent source of feedback is on other websites, such as online communities, blogs, local listings, and so on.

If your customers are unhappy with the resolution to a negative experience, they're likely to vent their ire on these forums.

The lost customer isn't the only casualty. Studies have shown that each dissatisfied customer typically shares the unsatisfactory experience with 8 to 10 (sometimes even 20) others.

With the growing use of social media, it's not uncommon for negative feedback to go viral and hurt a brand's credibility.
