Microsoft Entra ID offers different kinds of mechanisms for authentication. In DevOps Projects, though, one of the most important is the use of Service Principals.

## Microsoft Entra applications

Applications are registered with a Microsoft Entra tenant within Microsoft Entra ID. Registering an application creates an identity configuration. You also determine who can use it:

 -  Accounts in the same organizational directory.
 -  Accounts in any organizational directory.
 -  Accounts in any organizational directory and Microsoft Accounts (personal).
 -  Microsoft Accounts (Personal accounts only).

## Client secret

Once the application is created, you then should create at least one client secret for the application.

## Grant permissions

The application identity can then be granted permissions within services and resources that trust Microsoft Entra ID.

## Service principal

To access resources, an entity must be represented by a security principal. To connect, the entity must know:

 -  TenantID.
 -  ApplicationID.
 -  Client Secret.
