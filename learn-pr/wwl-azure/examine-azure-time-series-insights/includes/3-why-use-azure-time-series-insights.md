Azure Time Series Insights is an end-to-end platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering. You can use it to collect, process, store, analyze, and query data at an Internet of Things (IoT) scale.

## Definition of IoT data

Industrial IoT data in asset-intensive organizations often lacks structural consistency due to the varied nature of devices and sensors in an industrial setting. Data from these streams are characterized by significant gaps, and sometimes corrupted messages, and false readings. IoT data is often meaningful in the context of data inputs that come from first-party or third-party sources, such as CRM or ERP, that add context to end-to-end workflows. Inputs from third-party data sources such as weather data can help augment telemetry streams in a given installation.

In some industrial IoT scenarios, only a fraction of the data gets used for operational and business purposes, and analysis often requires contextualization of the data in order to be effective. Industrial data is often historicized for in-depth analysis over longer time spans to understand and correlate trends.

Turning collected IoT data into actionable insights requires:

 -  Data processing to clean, filter, interpolate, transform, and prepare data for analysis.
 -  A structure to navigate through and understand the data, that is, to normalize and contextualize the data.
 -  Cost-effective storage for long or infinite retention of processed (or derived) data and raw data.

Such data provides consistent, comprehensive, current, and correct information for business analysis and reporting.

## Azure Time Series Insights for industrial IoT

The IoT landscape is diverse with customers spanning various industry segments including manufacturing, automotive, energy, utilities, smart buildings, and consulting. Across this broad range of industrial IoT market, cloud-native solutions that provide comprehensive analytics targeted at large-scale IoT data are still evolving.

Azure Time Series Insights addresses this market need by providing a turnkey, end-to-end IoT analytics solution with rich semantic modeling for contextualization of time series data, asset-based insights, and best-in-class user experience for discovery, trending, anomaly detection and operational intelligence.

A rich operational analytics platform combined with our interactive data exploration capabilities, you can use Time Series Insights to derive more value out of data collected from IoT assets. The preview offering supports:

 -  Multi-layered storage solution with warm and cold analytics support providing customers the option to route data between warm and cold for interactive analytics over warm data as well as operational intelligence over decades of historical data.
    
     -  A highly interactive warm analytics solution to perform frequent, and large number of queries over shorter time span data.
     -  A scalable, performant, and cost optimized time series data lake based on Azure Storage allowing customers to trend yearsâ€™ worth of time series data in seconds.
 -  Semantic model support that describes the domain and metadata associated with the derived and raw signals from assets and devices.
 -  Flexible analytics platform to store historical time series data in customer-owned Azure Storage account, thereby allowing customers to have ownership of their IoT data. Data is stored in open-source Apache Parquet format that enables connectivity and interop across various data scenarios including predictive analytics, machine learning, and other custom computations done using familiar technologies including Spark, Databricks, and Jupyter.
 -  Rich analytics with enhanced query APIs and user experience that combines asset-based data insights with data analytics and support for interpolation, scalar and aggregate functions, categorical variables, scatter plots, and time shifting time series signals for in-depth analysis.
 -  Enterprise grade platform to support the scale, performance, security, and reliability needs of our enterprise IoT customers.
 -  Extensibility and integration support for end-to-end analytics. Time Series Insights provides an extensible analytics platform for various data scenarios. Time Series Insights Power BI connector enables customers to take the queries they do in Time Series Insights directly into Power BI to get unified view of their BI and time series analytics in a single pane of glass.
