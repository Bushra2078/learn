In this module, you have learned about Azure Container Registry, a managed registry service used to store and manage container images and related artifacts. You can use Azure container registries with your existing container development and deployment pipelines or use Azure Container Registry Tasks to build container images in Azure. The key features of Azure Container Registry include registry service tiers, security and access, supported images and artifacts, and automated image builds.

The main takeaways from this module are that you can use Azure Container Registry to store and manage container images and related artifacts, and you can automate builds with triggers such as source code commits and base image updates. Additionally, you can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to assign specific permissions to users, service principals, or other identities that need to interact with a registry, and you can limit access to a registry by assigning virtual network private IP addresses to the registry endpoints and using Azure Private Link.
