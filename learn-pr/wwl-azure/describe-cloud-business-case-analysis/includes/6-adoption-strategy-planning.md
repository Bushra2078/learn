Planning a cloud adoption strategy leveraging U.S. Sovereign clouds has many considerations. There are numerous events that often trigger the need to decide whether to migrate or to innovate the workloads within different Sovereign Cloud environments. As a result, you must decide whether to migrate or innovate.

## Common Critical Organization Events

- Data center exit
- Merger, acquisition, re-organization, or divestiture
- Reduction in capital expenses or reduction in allocated budget
- End of support for mission-critical technologies
- Response to regulatory compliance changes
- New data sovereignty requirements
- Need to reduce disruptions of IT
- Need to improve of IT stability
- Need to reduce carbon footprint

Consolidating or eliminating data centers occurs regularly, and as the nature of Government evolves, so do its organizational structures. Government organizations have fluctuating budgets, and over time, must evaluate whether it’s financially viable to maintain support for some mission-critical technologies.

As the OMB, GSA, President, Congress, and other Government organizations introduce new orders, organizations must decide how they will respond. If there is a need to improve IT stability and even address climate change, for example, organizations must decide whether to migrate workloads or innovate.

## Moving away from "The Five R's"

Previously, Microsoft provided five options as part of our Cloud Adoption Framework:

- **Re-host**, meaning move the workload to a different host, or lift and shift
- **Re-factor**, meaning make minor changes to the workload to make it operate better in the cloud
- **Replace**, meaning completely remove it and use a new cloud version
- **Re-architect**, meaning make significant changes to the workload
- **Re-build**, meaning restructure the workload to be cloud native

Over time, we’ve noticed that these critical organization events typically require the choice of only two paths: migrate or innovate.

## When to Migrate

If the desire is simply cost savings, reduction in complexity, operational optimization, better agility, providing the ability to later provide more technical capabilities, scaling to meet mission and geographic demands, or integrating into a broader IT systems portfolio, Government entities benefit best by simply migrating their workloads to the cloud.

> - Cost savings
> - Reduction in technical complexity
> - Optimization of internal operations
> - Increase in mission agility
> - Preparation for new technical capabilities
> - Scaling to meet mission demands
> - Scaling to meet geographic demands
> - Integration of a complex IT or systems portfolio

## When to Innovate

If the desire is to not only prepare for new capabilities but also build them to advance the mission, scale to meet geographic and mission demands, improve experiences and services provided to citizens, transform the way the agency operates, and be a disruptor through self-service and optimization, then innovation is the path organizations choose.

> - Preparation for new technical capabilities
> - Building new technical capabilities
> - Scaling to meet mission demands
> - Scaling to meet geographic demands
> - Improved citizen experiences and engagements
> - Transformation of products or services
> - Market disruption with new products or services
> - Democratization and/or self-service environments

## Importance

Migration and innovation are core adoption planning strategies when selecting a U.S. Sovereign Cloud environment. While all U.S. Sovereign Cloud environments support IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings, some workloads will benefit more from selection a specific cloud strategy and cloud environment.

Microsoft provides numerous architectural and planning resources, such as Cloud Solution Architects, Customer Success Managers, and Customer Success Account Managers, at no charge to existing Microsoft customers to help them best assess whether migration or innovation is a better path for each workload.
