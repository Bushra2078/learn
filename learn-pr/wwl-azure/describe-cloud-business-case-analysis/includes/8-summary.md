A cloud business case analysis may be required before a government agency may utilize the cloud or cloud computing technologies, including sovereign clouds, as well as the different types of cloud hosting environments. Because government entities act in the interest of their stakeholders, U.S. persons, they must do so by making investments to avoid waste and abuse.

Performing a business case analysis follows a pre-defined process using a template provided by the U.S. Government. Investments are measured based upon performance measures (baseline, target, and goal), the operational impact, and financial costs. The financial costs include savings projections that the investment will guarantee.

While it's not always required, performing an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) can provide a holistic picture of financial measures, financial run costs, migration and innovation costs, productivity gains, and business and mission gains that are part of a digital transformation journey. By enumerating these considerations, you may benefit in helping to determine which cloud environment best suits your workload.

In addition to financial measures, different alternatives may provide improvements in performance, availability, securability, scalability, elasticity, maintainability, accessibility, deployability, and extensibility. U.S. Sovereign clouds provide non-financial benefits such as workload sovereignty, pro-active cybersecurity posture, episodic growth, and inherent resiliency.

Performing a risk analysis and assessment for different workloads is critical to not only determine whether the workload is best suited for on-premise or in the cloud, but also which U.S. Sovereign cloud to utilize.

Migration and innovation are core adoption planning strategies when selecting a U.S. Sovereign Cloud environment. While all U.S. Sovereign Cloud environments support IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings, some workloads will benefit more from selection a specific cloud strategy and cloud environment.

Microsoft provides numerous architectural and planning resources, such as Cloud Solution Architects, Customer Success Managers, and Customer Success Account Managers, at no charge to existing Microsoft customers to help them best assess whether migration or innovation is a better path for each workload.
