Now that you have an understanding of the significant government strategic actions that have determined what the governmentâ€™s cloud strategy would be, we'll cover Cloud Business Case analysis. 

As you may recall, a business case analysis may be required before a government agency may utilize the cloud or cloud computing technologies, including sovereign clouds, as well as the different types of cloud hosting environments.

Government entities act in the interest of their stakeholders, U.S. persons. When those entities act to improve the quality of the services they provide, they must do so by making investments to avoid waste and abuse. Investments are measured based upon performance measures (baseline, target, and goal), the operational impact, and financial costs, such as savings projections the investment will guarantee.

In this module, we'll cover how to perform a business case analysis, an analysis of alternatives, and understand the importance of doing so.
