One of the most common uses for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Common Information Model (CIM) is querying configuration information from computers. In this module, you'll learn more about the structure of the namespaces that contain classes and also how to query instances of a class. You'll learn how to query remote computers by using ad-hoc connections and CIM sessions.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- List the available namespaces.
- List local repository namespaces.
- Query instances of a specified class.
- Query instances of a specified class by using WMI, CIM, and WMI Query Language (WQL).
- Connect to remote computers by using CIM or WMI.
- Query repository classes from remote computers by using CIM sessions objects.
