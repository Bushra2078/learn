GitHub Codespaces addresses several issues from which developers regularly suffer.

First, many developers are working with old hardware and software systems, which are not refreshed.

Second, developers are often tied to individual development systems. Moving from location to location or system to system is inconvenient or slow to configure.

A problem for the developers' organizations is the proliferation of intellectual property across all these machines.

## What is GitHub Codespaces?

Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that GitHub hosts. It is essentially an online implementation of Visual Studio Code.

Codespaces allows developers to work entirely in the cloud.

Codespaces even will enable developers to contribute from tablets and Chromebooks.

Because it is based on Visual Studio Code, the development environment is still rich with:

 -  Syntax highlighting.
 -  Autocomplete.
 -  Integrated debugging.
 -  Direct Git integration.

Developers can create a codespace (or multiple codespaces) for a repository. Each codespace is associated with a specific branch of a repository.

## Using GitHub Codespaces

You can do all your work in codespaces within a browser.

For an even more responsive experience, you can connect to a codespace from a local copy of Visual Studio Code.
