Azure Boards has direct integration with Azure Repos, but it can also be integrated with GitHub.

Integrating GitHub with Azure Boards lets you plan and track your work by linking GitHub commits, pull requests, and issues, directly to work items in Boards.

## Azure Boards App

The integration is created by using the Azure Boards App. Acting as a bridge between Azure Boards and GitHub.

To install the app, you must be an administrator or owner of the GitHub repository or the GitHub organization.

The app is installed from the GitHub Marketplace. [Azure Boards App](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards)
