An important security task is ensuring that your server has updates to software applied in a timely fashion. Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) provides infrastructure to download, test, and approve updates for on-premises Windows Server and Windows Client environments. When you install updates quickly—especially security updates—you help block attacks based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the update.
