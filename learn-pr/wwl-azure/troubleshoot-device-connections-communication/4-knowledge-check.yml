  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer is writing code that will implement the device connection \"retry\" pattern. The first step in the code is to detect an error. What is the next step in the process that the code should implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Retry according to the specified retry policy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If conditions allow, the code should implement a retry according to the specified retry policy, but this step is not the next step."
    - content: "Filter by error type and decide if a retry is needed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The next step is to filter by error type and decide if a retry is needed."
    - content: "Determine whether the error is an unrecoverable error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The code should determine whether the error is an unrecoverable error, but this step is not the next step."
  - content: "What are the three retry policies that are supported by the IoT SDKs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Scheduled retry, Custom retry, No retry"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scheduled retry is not a retry policy provided in the IoT SDKs."
    - content: "Exponential back-off, Custom back-off, No retry"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Custom back-off is not a retry policy provided in the IoT SDKs."
    - content: "Exponential back-off, Custom retry, No retry"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The three retry policies provided by the IoT SDKs are Exponential back-off, Custom retry, No retry."
