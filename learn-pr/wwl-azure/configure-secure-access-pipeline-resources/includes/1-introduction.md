# Introduction to Implement security through a pipeline using DevOps

While a DevOps culture enables development and operations teams to deploy applications faster, going faster over a cliff doesn't help.

Security is a crucial part of DevOps. DevSecOps is a continuous and ongoing effort that requires the attention of everyone.

Cloud environments brought unprecedented infrastructure and scale to DevOps teams. They can be approached by some of the most nefarious actors on the internet, as they risk the security of their business with every application deployment.

How do you ensure your applications are secure and stay secure with continuous integration and delivery? How can you find and fix security issues early in the process?

DevSecOps incorporates the security team and their capabilities into your DevOps practices making security the responsibility of everyone on the team.

Securing applications is a continuous process encompassing secure infrastructure, designing architecture with layered security, continuous security validation, and monitoring attacks.

You'll learn best practices for securing pipelines in Azure DevOps, how to configure secure access to pipeline resources, secure access to Azure Repos from pipelines, manage permissions, structure projects and repositories for security, extend pipelines with multiple templates, secure variables, and parameters, and manage identity for projects, pipelines, and agents.

This module series is designed for developers, administrators, and IT professionals responsible for managing and securing pipelines in Azure DevOps. By the end of this journey, you will have the skills to secure your pipelines.

The course is divided into several modules, each covering a specific topic related to securing pipelines in Azure DevOps. Each module includes lectures, hands-on activities, quizzes, and challenges to help you apply your knowledge and practice what you have learned. At the end of each module, you will take a final assessment to evaluate your understanding of the subject.
