It is easy to add a service endpoint to the virtual network. Several services are available including: Azure Active Directory, Azure Cosmos DB, EventHub, KeyVault, Service Bus, SQL, and Storage.

**Azure Storage**. Generally available in all Azure regions. This endpoint gives traffic an optimal route to the Azure Storage service. Each storage account supports up to 100 virtual network rules.

**Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse**. Generally available in all Azure regions. A firewall security feature that controls whether the database server for your single databases and elastic pool in Azure SQL Database or for your databases in SQL Data Warehouse accepts communications that are sent from particular subnets in virtual networks.

**Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and MySQL**. Generally available in Azure regions where database service is available. Virtual Network (VNet) services endpoints and rules extend the private address space of a Virtual Network to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and MySQL server.

**Azure Cosmos DB**. Generally available in all Azure regions. You can configure the Azure Cosmos account to allow access only from a specific subnet of virtual network (VNet). By enabling Service endpoint to access Azure Cosmos DB on the subnet within a virtual network, the traffic from that subnet is sent to Azure Cosmos DB with the identity of the subnet and Virtual Network. Once the Azure Cosmos DB service endpoint is enabled, you can limit access to the subnet by adding it to your Azure Cosmos account.

**Azure Key Vault**. Generally available in all Azure regions. The virtual network service endpoints for Azure Key Vault allow you to restrict access to a specified virtual network. The endpoints also allow you to restrict access to a list of IPv4 (internet protocol version 4) address ranges. Any user connecting to your key vault from outside those sources is denied access.

**Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Hubs**. Generally available in all Azure regions. The integration of Service Bus with Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints enables secure access to messaging capabilities from workloads like virtual machines that are bound to virtual networks, with the network traffic path being secured on both ends.

> [!NOTE]
> Adding service endpoints can take up to 15 minutes to complete. Each service endpoint integration has its own Azure documentation page.
