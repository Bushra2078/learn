A virtual network service endpoint provides the identity of your virtual network to the Azure service. Once service endpoints are enabled in your virtual network, you can secure Azure service resources to your virtual network by adding a virtual network rule to the resources.

Today, Azure service traffic from a virtual network uses public IP addresses as source IP addresses. With service endpoints, service traffic switches to use virtual network private addresses as the source IP addresses when accessing the Azure service from a virtual network. This switch allows you to access the services without the need for reserved, public IP addresses used in IP firewalls.

## Why use a service endpoint?

 -  **Improved security for your Azure service resources**. VNet private address spaces can be overlapping and so, cannot be used to uniquely identify traffic originating from your VNet. Service endpoints secure Azure service resources to your virtual network by extending VNet identity to the service. When service endpoints are enabled in your virtual network, you secure Azure service resources to your virtual network by adding a virtual network rule. The rule improves security by fully removing public Internet access to resources, and allowing traffic only from your virtual network.
 -  **Optimal routing for Azure service traffic from your virtual network**. Today, any routes in your virtual network that force Internet traffic to your premises and/or virtual appliances, known as forced-tunneling, also force Azure service traffic to take the same route as the Internet traffic. Service endpoints provide optimal routing for Azure traffic.
 -  **Endpoints always take service traffic directly from your virtual network to the service on the Microsoft Azure backbone network**. Keeping traffic on the Azure backbone network allows you to continue auditing and monitoring outbound Internet traffic from your virtual networks, through forced-tunneling, without impacting service traffic. Learn more about user-defined routes and forced-tunneling.
 -  **Simple to set up with less management overhead**. You no longer need reserved, public IP addresses in your virtual networks to secure Azure resources through IP firewall. There are no NAT or gateway devices required to set up the service endpoints. Service endpoints are configured through the subnet. There's no exta overhead to maintaining the endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> With service endpoints, the virtual machine IP addresses switches from public to private IPv4 addresses. Existing Azure service firewall rules using Azure public IP addresses will stop working with this switch. Ensure Azure service firewall rules allow for this switch before setting up service endpoints. You may also experience temporary interruption to service traffic from this subnet while configuring service endpoints.
