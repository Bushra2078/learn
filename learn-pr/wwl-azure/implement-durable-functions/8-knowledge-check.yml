  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following durable function types is used to read and update small pieces of state?"
    choices:
    - content: "Orchestrator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Orchestrator functions describe how actions are executed and the order in which actions are executed."
    - content: "Activity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Activity functions are the basic unit of work in a durable function orchestration and don't manage state."
    - content: "Entity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Entity functions define operations for reading and updating small pieces of state."
  - content: "Which application pattern would you use for a durable function that is polling a resource until a specific condition is met?"
    choices:
    - content: "Function chaining"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In the function chaining pattern, a sequence of functions executes in a specific order."
    - content: "Fan out/fan in"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In the fan out/fan in pattern, you execute multiple functions in parallel and then wait for all functions to finish."
    - content: "Monitor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The monitor pattern refers to a flexible, recurring process in a workflow. An example is polling until specific conditions are met."
