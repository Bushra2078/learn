 The *durable functions* extension lets you define stateful workflows by writing  *orchestrator functions* and stateful entities by writing  *entity functions* using the Azure Functions programming model. Behind the scenes, the extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you, allowing you to focus on your business logic.

## Supported languages

Durable Functions currently supports the following languages:

* **C#**: both precompiled class libraries and C# script.
* **JavaScript**: supported only for version 2.x of the Azure Functions runtime. Requires version 1.7.0 of the Durable Functions extension, or a later version.
* **Python**: requires version 2.3.1 of the Durable Functions extension, or a later version.
* **F#**: precompiled class libraries and F# script. F# script is only supported for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime.
* **PowerShell**: support for Durable Functions is currently in public preview. Supported only for version 3.x of the Azure Functions runtime and PowerShell 7. Requires version 2.2.2 of the Durable Functions extension, or a later version. Only the following patterns are currently supported: Function chaining, Fan-out/fan-in, Async HTTP APIs.


## Application patterns

The primary use case for Durable Functions is simplifying complex, stateful coordination requirements in serverless applications. The following sections describe typical application patterns that can benefit from Durable Functions:

* Function chaining
* Fan-out/fan-in
* Async HTTP APIs
* Monitor
* Human interaction

### Function chaining

In the function chaining pattern, a sequence of functions executes in a specific order. In this pattern, the output of one function is applied to the input of another function.

:::image type="content" source="../media/function-chaining.png" alt-text="Four functions executing in a specific order":::

In the code example below, the values `F1`, `F2`, `F3`, and `F4` are the names of other functions in the function app. You can implement control flow by using normal imperative coding constructs. Code executes from the top down. The code can involve existing language control flow semantics, like conditionals and loops. You can include error handling logic in `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks.

```csharp
[FunctionName("Chaining")]
public static async Task<object> Run(
    [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    try
    {
        var x = await context.CallActivityAsync<object>("F1", null);
        var y = await context.CallActivityAsync<object>("F2", x);
        var z = await context.CallActivityAsync<object>("F3", y);
        return  await context.CallActivityAsync<object>("F4", z);
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        // Error handling or compensation goes here.
    }
}
```

### Fan out/fan in

In the fan out/fan in pattern, you execute multiple functions in parallel and then wait for all functions to finish. Often, some aggregation work is done on the results that are returned from the functions.

:::image type="content" source="../media/fan-out-fan-in.png" alt-text="A single function that fans out to three functions that execute in parallel and, after operation of all three ends, sending the result to another function.":::

With normal functions, you can fan out by having the function send multiple messages to a queue. To fan in you write code to track when the queue-triggered functions end, and then store function outputs.

In the code example below, the fan-out work is distributed to multiple instances of the `F2` function. The work is tracked by using a dynamic list of tasks. The .NET `Task.WhenAll` API or JavaScript `context.df.Task.all` API is called, to wait for all the called functions to finish. Then, the `F2` function outputs are aggregated from the dynamic task list and passed to the `F3` function.

```csharp
[FunctionName("FanOutFanIn")]
public static async Task Run(
    [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    var parallelTasks = new List<Task<int>>();

    // Get a list of N work items to process in parallel.
    object[] workBatch = await context.CallActivityAsync<object[]>("F1", null);
    for (int i = 0; i < workBatch.Length; i++)
    {
        Task<int> task = context.CallActivityAsync<int>("F2", workBatch[i]);
        parallelTasks.Add(task);
    }

    await Task.WhenAll(parallelTasks);

    // Aggregate all N outputs and send the result to F3.
    int sum = parallelTasks.Sum(t => t.Result);
    await context.CallActivityAsync("F3", sum);
}
```

The automatic checkpointing that happens at the `await` or `yield` call on `Task.WhenAll` or `context.df.Task.all` ensures that a potential midway crash or reboot doesn't require restarting an already completed task.

### Async HTTP APIs

The async HTTP API pattern addresses the problem of coordinating the state of long-running operations with external clients. A common way to implement this pattern is by having an HTTP endpoint trigger the long-running action. Then, redirect the client to a status endpoint that the client polls to learn when the operation is finished.

:::image type="content" source="../media/async-http-api.png" alt-text="An HTTP endpoint triggers the long running action with the client polling for completion status.":::

Durable Functions provides **built-in support** for this pattern, simplifying or even removing the code you need to write to interact with long-running function executions. After an instance starts, the extension exposes webhook HTTP APIs that query the orchestrator function status.

The following example shows REST commands that start an orchestrator and query its status. For clarity, some protocol details are omitted from the example.

```
> curl -X POST https://myfunc.azurewebsites.net/orchestrators/DoWork -H "Content-Length: 0" -i
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json

```

The Durable Functions extension exposes built-in HTTP APIs that manage long-running orchestrations. You can alternatively implement this pattern yourself by using your own function triggers (such as HTTP, a queue, or Azure Event Hubs) and the orchestration client binding.

You can use the `HttpStart` triggered function to start instances of an orchestrator function using a client function.

```csharp
public static class HttpStart
{
    [FunctionName("HttpStart")]
    public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, methods: "post", Route = "orchestrators/{functionName}")] HttpRequestMessage req,
        [DurableClient] IDurableClient starter,
        string functionName,
        ILogger log)
    {
        // Function input comes from the request content.
        object eventData = await req.Content.ReadAsAsync<object>();
        string instanceId = await starter.StartNewAsync(functionName, eventData);

        log.LogInformation($"Started orchestration with ID = '{instanceId}'.");

        return starter.CreateCheckStatusResponse(req, instanceId);
    }
}
```

To interact with orchestrators, the function must include a `DurableClient` input binding. You use the client to start an orchestration. It can also help you return an HTTP response containing URLs for checking the status of the new orchestration.

### Monitor

The monitor pattern refers to a flexible, recurring process in a workflow. An example is polling until specific conditions are met. You can use a regular timer trigger to address a basic scenario, such as a periodic cleanup job, but its interval is static and managing instance lifetimes becomes complex. You can use Durable Functions to create flexible recurrence intervals, manage task lifetimes, and create multiple monitor processes from a single orchestration.

:::image type="content" source="../media/monitor.png" alt-text="A function running until a specific condition is met.":::


In a few lines of code, you can use Durable Functions to create multiple monitors that observe arbitrary endpoints. The monitors can end execution when a condition is met, or another function can use the durable orchestration client to terminate the monitors. You can change a monitor's `wait` interval based on a specific condition (for example, exponential backoff).

The following code implements a basic monitor:

```csharp
[FunctionName("MonitorJobStatus")]
public static async Task Run(
    [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    int jobId = context.GetInput<int>();
    int pollingInterval = GetPollingInterval();
    DateTime expiryTime = GetExpiryTime();

    while (context.CurrentUtcDateTime < expiryTime)
    {
        var jobStatus = await context.CallActivityAsync<string>("GetJobStatus", jobId);
        if (jobStatus == "Completed")
        {
            // Perform an action when a condition is met.
            await context.CallActivityAsync("SendAlert", machineId);
            break;
        }

        // Orchestration sleeps until this time.
        var nextCheck = context.CurrentUtcDateTime.AddSeconds(pollingInterval);
        await context.CreateTimer(nextCheck, CancellationToken.None);
    }

    // Perform more work here, or let the orchestration end.
}
```

### Human interaction

Many automated processes involve some kind of human interaction. Involving humans in an automated process is tricky because people aren't as highly available and as responsive as cloud services. An automated process might allow for this interaction by using timeouts and compensation logic.

:::image type="content" source="../media/human-interaction-pattern.png" alt-text="A process awaiting human interaction before continuing.":::

You can implement the pattern in this example by using an orchestrator function. The orchestrator uses a durable timer to request approval. The orchestrator escalates if timeout occurs. The orchestrator waits for an external event, such as a notification that's generated by a human interaction.

```csharp
[FunctionName("ApprovalWorkflow")]
public static async Task Run(
    [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    await context.CallActivityAsync("RequestApproval", null);
    using (var timeoutCts = new CancellationTokenSource())
    {
        DateTime dueTime = context.CurrentUtcDateTime.AddHours(72);
        Task durableTimeout = context.CreateTimer(dueTime, timeoutCts.Token);

        Task<bool> approvalEvent = context.WaitForExternalEvent<bool>("ApprovalEvent");
        if (approvalEvent == await Task.WhenAny(approvalEvent, durableTimeout))
        {
            timeoutCts.Cancel();
            await context.CallActivityAsync("ProcessApproval", approvalEvent.Result);
        }
        else
        {
            await context.CallActivityAsync("Escalate", null);
        }
    }
}
```
