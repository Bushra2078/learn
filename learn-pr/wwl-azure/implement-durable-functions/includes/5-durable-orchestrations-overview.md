You can use an *orchestrator function* to orchestrate the execution of other Durable functions within a function app. Orchestrator functions have the following characteristics:

* Orchestrator functions define function workflows using procedural code. No declarative schemas or designers are needed.
* Orchestrator functions can call other durable functions synchronously and asynchronously. Output from called functions can be reliably saved to local variables.
* Orchestrator functions are durable and reliable. Execution progress is automatically checkpointed when the function "awaits" or "yields". Local state is never lost when the process recycles or the VM reboots.
* Orchestrator functions can be long-running. The total lifespan of an *orchestration instance* can be seconds, days, months, or never-ending.

## Orchestration identity

Each *instance* of an orchestration has an instance identifier (also known as an *instance ID*). By default, each instance ID is an autogenerated GUID. However, instance IDs can also be any user-generated string value. Each orchestration instance ID must be unique within a task hub.

> [!NOTE]
> It is generally recommended to use autogenerated instance IDs whenever possible. User-generated instance IDs are intended for scenarios where there is a one-to-one mapping between an orchestration instance and some external application-specific entity.

An orchestration's instance ID is a required parameter for most instance management operations. They are also important for diagnostics, such as searching through orchestration tracking data in Application Insights for troubleshooting or analytics purposes. For this reason, it is recommended to save generated instance IDs to some external location (for example, a database or in application logs) where they can be easily referenced later.

## Reliability

Orchestrator functions reliably maintain their execution state by using the event sourcing design pattern. Instead of directly storing the current state of an orchestration, the Durable Task Framework uses an append-only store to record the full series of actions the function orchestration takes. 

Durable Functions uses event sourcing transparently. Behind the scenes, the `await` (C#) or `yield` (JavaScript) operator in an orchestrator function yields control of the orchestrator thread back to the Durable Task Framework dispatcher. The dispatcher then commits any new actions that the orchestrator function scheduled (such as calling one or more child functions or scheduling a durable timer) to storage. The transparent commit action appends to the execution history of the orchestration instance. The history is stored in a storage table. The commit action then adds messages to a queue to schedule the actual work. At this point, the orchestrator function can be unloaded from memory.

When an orchestration function is given more work to do, the orchestrator wakes up and re-executes the entire function from the start to rebuild the local state. During the replay, if the code tries to call a function (or do any other async work), the Durable Task Framework consults the execution history of the current orchestration. If it finds that the activity function has already executed and yielded a result, it replays that function's result and the orchestrator code continues to run. Replay continues until the function code is finished or until it has scheduled new async work.

## Features and patterns

The table below describes the features and patterns of orchestrator functions.

| Pattern/Feature | Description |
|--|--|
| Sub-orchestrations | Orchestrator functions can call activity functions, but also other orchestrator functions. For example, you can build a larger orchestration out of a library of orchestrator functions. Or, you can run multiple instances of an orchestrator function in parallel. |
| Durable timers | Orchestrations can schedule durable timers to implement delays or to set up timeout handling on async actions. Use durable timers in orchestrator functions instead of `Thread.Sleep` and `Task.Delay` (C#) or `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` (JavaScript). |
| External events | Orchestrator functions can wait for external events to update an orchestration instance. This Durable Functions feature often is useful for handling a human interaction or other external callbacks. |
| Error handling | Orchestrator functions can use the error-handling features of the programming language. Existing patterns like `try/catch` are supported in orchestration code. |
| Critical sections | Orchestration instances are single-threaded so it isn't necessary to worry about race conditions _within_ an orchestration. However, race conditions are possible when orchestrations interact with external systems. To mitigate race conditions when interacting with external systems, orchestrator functions can define _critical sections_ using a `LockAsync` method in .NET. |
| Calling HTTP endpoints | Orchestrator functions aren't permitted to do I/O. The typical workaround for this limitation is to wrap any code that needs to do I/O in an activity function. Orchestrations that interact with external systems frequently use activity functions to make HTTP calls and return the result to the orchestration. |
| Passing multiple parameters | It isn't possible to pass multiple parameters to an activity function directly. The recommendation is to pass in an array of objects or to use ValueTuples objects in .NET. |
