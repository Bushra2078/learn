Tailwind Traders, a fictitious home improvement retailer has begun the digital transformation of their applications and services to help with the growth of the company. A present scenario involves accessing, storing and doing analysis on sensor data from the GPS on their delivery trucks that are on the road delivering goods. Management wants a solution for being able to do real time analytics on the streaming data from the GPS on the trucks and make decisions in real time.

On further analysis, you find that they would like this data present in an existing Power BI visualization dashboard.

How will you help address this problem? Azure Stream Analytics can help in this scenario.

 

## Describe Azure Stream Analytics

The process of consuming data streams, analyzing them, and deriving actionable insights is called stream processing. Azure Stream Analytics is a fully managed (PaaS offering), real-time analytics and complex event-processing engine. It offers the possibility to perform real-time analytics on multiple streams of data from sources such as IoT device data, sensors, clickstreams and social media feeds.

Azure Stream Analytics works on the following concepts:

- **Data stream**- Data streams are continuous data generated by applications, IoT devices or sensors. These data streams are analyzed, and actionable insights are extracted from it. For example, monitoring data stream from industrial and manufacturing equipment, Monitoring data of water pipelines by utility providers. Data streams help understand change over time.

- **Event processing** - Event processing refers to consumption and analysis of a continuous data stream to extract actionable insights from the events happening within that stream. For example, a car passing through a tollbooth should include temporal information, such as a timestamp, indicating when it occurred.

### Key features of Azure Stream Analytics

Stream Analytics ingests data from Azure Event Hubs (including Azure Event Hubs from Apache Kafka), Azure IoT Hub, or Azure Blob Storage. The query, which is based on SQL query language, can be used to easily filter, sort, aggregate, and join streaming data over a period. You can also extend this SQL language with JavaScript and C# user-defined functions (UDFs). You can [understand stream processing](/learn/modules/ingest-data-streams-with-azure-stream-analytics/2-understand-stream-processing) by reading more about it.

An Azure Stream Analytics job consists of an input, query, and an output. You can do the following with the job output:

- Route data to storage systems like Azure Blob storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Store, and Azure CosmosDB.

- You can send data to Power BI for real-time visualization.

- You can store data in Data Warehouse service like Azure Synapse Analytics to train a machine learning model based on historical data or perform batch analytics.

- You can trigger custom downstream workflows by sending the data to services like Azure Functions, Service Bus Topics or Queues.

### When to consider Azure Stream Analytics

Following are some common enterprise data use-cases where Azure Stream Analytics can be effectively leveraged.

 

| **Use case**| **Azure Stream Analytics consideration** |
| - | - |
| Analyze real-time telemetry streams from IoT devices| Gathering real-time sensor data in Azure Stream Analytics from building automation systems relaying temperature, humidity, fan runtimes and making adjustments to maintain optimum building temperature while reducing costs. |
| Web logs/clickstream analytics| A consumer goods retailer can offer real-time product suggestions to users based on e-commerce analytics. |
| Geospatial analytics| Data sources include sensors, social media, satellite imagery, mobile devices etc. For example, extreme weather prediction of wildfires and hurricanes can help airlines with routing and send out alerts of adverse weather conditions to people. |
| Remote monitoring and predictive maintenance of high value assets| Monitoring high value assets such as Industrial equipment by gathering operational data in Azure Stream Analytics and maximizing the useful life of their equipment can be achieved through predictive maintenance to avoid disruption of operation. For example, data gathered from electrical power transformers used by utility companies. |
| Real-time analytics on Point of Sale data| Credit card fraudulent transactions can be detected and determined at point of sale depending on unusually large transaction or unusual location usage of the credit card. Alert triggers can be set up on data gathered in Azure Stream Analytics. |


In the Tailwind Traders scenario discussed above, we can leverage Azure Stream Analytics to visualize real-time locations of the trucks through Power BI. For management decisions on analytical workloads, data can be stored in Data warehouse like Cosmos DB, or Azure Data Lake for future analysis.

> Azure Stream Analytics supports processing events in CSV, JSON and Avro data formats.

### Benefits of Azure Stream Analytics

- Fully Managed - It is offered as a Platform as a Service offering, so there is no overhead of provisioning any hardware or infrastructure. Azure Stream Analytics fully manages your job, so you can focus on your business logic and not on the infrastructure.

- Low cost - Billing is done by Streaming Units (SUs) consumed which represent the amount of CPU and memory resources allocated. Scaling up and down are based on business needs which can also bring cost down. No maintenance costs are involved.

- Run in cloud or Intelligent edge - It can run in the cloud, for large-scale analytics, or run on IoT Edge or Azure Stack for ultra-low latency analytics.

- Performance - Stream Analytics offers reliable performance guarantees. It supports higher performance by partitioning, allowing complex queries to be parallelized and executed on multiple streaming nodes. Stream Analytics can process millions of events every second and it can deliver results with ultra-low latencies.

- Security - In terms of security, Azure Stream Analytics encrypts all incoming and outgoing communications and supports TLS 1.2. Built-in checkpoints are also encrypted. Stream Analytics does not store the incoming data since all processing is done in-memory.
