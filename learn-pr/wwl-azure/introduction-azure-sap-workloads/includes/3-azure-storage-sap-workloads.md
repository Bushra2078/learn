Azure has numerous storage types that differ vastly in capabilities, throughput, latency, and prices. Some of the storage types are are well suited or optimized for specific SAP workload scenarios while others are less so. Some Azure storage types got certified for the usage with SAP HANA. In this document, we will review the different types of storage and describe their capability and usability with SAP workloads and SAP components.

Public cloud vendors now use GiB ([Gibibyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte)) or TiB ([Tebibyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tebibyte)) as size units, instead of Gigabyte or Terabyte. Therefore all Azure documentation and pricing use those units. Throughout the document, we reference these size units of MiB, GiB, and TiB units exclusively. You might need to plan with MB, GB, and TB. So, be aware of some small differences in the calculations if you need to size for a 400 MiB/sec throughput, instead of a 250 MiB/sec throughput.

## Microsoft Azure Storage resiliency

Microsoft Azure storage of Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Azure premium storage, and Ultra disk keeps the base VHD (with OS) and VM attached data disks or VHDs in three copies on three different storage nodes. Failing over to another replica and seeding of a new replica in case of a storage node failure is transparent. As a result of this redundancy, it is NOT required to use any kind of storage redundancy layer across multiple Azure disks. This is called Local Redundant Storage (LRS). LRS is the default for these types of storage in Azure. [Azure NetApp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/netapp/) provides sufficient redundancy to achieve the same SLAs as other native Azure storage.

## Azure managed disks

Managed disks are a resource type in Azure Resource Manager that can be used instead of VHDs that are stored in Azure Storage Accounts. Managed Disks automatically align with the availability set of the virtual machine they are attached to and therefore increase the availability of your virtual machine and the services that are running on the virtual machine. 

Related to resiliency, this example demonstrates the advantage of managed disks:

- You are deploying your two DBMS VMs for your SAP system in an Azure availability set
- As Azure deploys the VMs, the disk with the OS image will be placed in a different storage cluster. This avoids that both VMs get impacted by an issue of a single Azure storage cluster
- As you create new managed disks that you assign to these VMs to store the data and log files of your database, these new disks for the two VMs are also deployed in separate storage clusters, so, that none of disks of the first VM are sharing storage clusters with the disks of the second VM

Deploying without managed disks in customer defined storage accounts, disk allocation is arbitrary and has no awareness of the fact that VMs are deployed within an AvSet for resiliency purposes.

> **Note**: New deployments of VMs that use Azure block storage for their disks (all Azure storage except Azure NetApp Files) must use Azure managed disks for the base VHD/OS disks, data disks that contain SAP database files, independent of whether you deploy the VMs through availability sets, across Availability Zones, or independent of the sets and zones. Disks that are used for the purpose of storing backups are not necessarily required to be managed disks. Azure managed disks provide local redundancy (LRS) only.

## Storage scenarios with SAP workloads

Persisted storage is needed in SAP workloads in various components of the stack that you deploy in Azure. These scenarios include:

- Persisted storage for the base VHD of your VM that holds the operating system and other software you install in that disk. This disk/VHD is the root of your VM. Any changes made to it need to be persisted so that the next time you stop and restart the VM, all the changes made before still exist. This is especially important in cases where the VM is getting deployed by Azure onto another host than where it was running originally.
- Persisted data disks. These disks are VHDs you attach to store application data in. This application data could be data and log/redo files of a database, backup files, or software installations. Itâ€™s also used for any disk beyond your base VHD that holds the operating system.
- File shares or shared disks that contain your global transport directory for NetWeaver or S/4HANA. Content of those shares is either consumed by software running in multiple VMs or is used to build high-availability failover cluster scenarios.
- The /sapmnt directory or common file shares for EDI processes or similar. Content of those shares is either consumed by software running in multiple VMs or is used to build high-availability failover cluster scenarios.

## Azure premium storage

Azure premium SSD storage provides:

- Low I/O latency
- SLAs for IOPS and throughput
- Less variability in I/O latency

Azure premium storage is one of the Azure storage types recommended for SAP workload. This recommendation applies for non-production as well as production systems. Azure premium storage is suited to handle database workloads. The usage of Azure Write Accelerator is going to improve write latency against Azure premium disks substantially. However, for DBMS systems with high IOPS and throughput rates, you need to either over-provision storage capacity, or you need to use functionality like Windows Storage Spaces or logical volume managers in Linux to build stripe sets that give you the desired capacity on the one side, but also the necessary IOPS or throughput at best cost efficiency.

### Azure burst functionality for premium storage

For Azure premium storage disks smaller or equal to 512 GiB in capacity, burst functionality is offered. The ideal cases where this burst functionality can be planned in is likely going to be the volumes or disks that contain data files for the different DBMS. The I/O workload expected against those volumes, especially with small to mid-ranged systems is expected to be similar to:

- Low to moderate read workload since data ideally is cached in memory, or like in the case of HANA should be completely in memory
- Bursts of write triggered by database checkpoints or savepoints that are issued on a regular basis
- Backup workload that reads in a continuous stream in cases where backups are not executed via storage snapshots
- For SAP HANA, load of the data into memory after an instance restart

Especially on smaller DBMS systems where your workload is handling a few hundred transactions per seconds only, such a burst functionality can make sense as well for the disks or volumes that store the transaction or redo log. Expected workload against such a disk or volumes is similar to:

- Regular writes to the disk that are dependent on the workload and the nature of workload since every commit issued by the application is likely to trigger an I/O operation
- Higher workload in throughput for cases of operational tasks, like creating or rebuilding indexes
- Read bursts when performing transaction log or redo log backups

## Azure Ultra disk

Azure ultra disks are a suitable storage with low latency for all kinds of SAP workload. So far, Ultra disk can only be used in combinations with VMs that have been deployed through Availability Zones (zonal deployment). Ultra disk does not support storage snapshots at this time. Unlike other storage, Ultra disk cannot be used for the base VHD disk. Ultra disk is ideal for cases where I/O workload fluctuates a lot and you want to adapt deployed storage throughput or IOPS to storage workload patterns instead of sizing for maximum usage of bandwidth and IOPS.

## Azure NetApp files (ANF)

Azure NetApp Files is a HANA certified low latency storage that allows to deploy NFS and SMB volumes or shares. The storage comes with three different service levels that provide different throughput and IOPS in a linear manner per GiB capacity of the volume. The ANF storage is enabling to deploy SAP HANA scale-out scenarios with a standby node. The storage is suitable for providing file shares as needed for /sapmnt or SAP global transport directory. ANF storage come with functionality availability that is available as native NetApp functionality.

## Azure standard SSD storage

Azure standard SSD storage is the minimum recommendation for non-production VMs for base VHD, eventual DBMS deployments with relative latency insensitivity and/or low IOPS and throughput rates. This Azure storage type is not supported anymore for hosting the SAP Global Transport Directory.

## Azure standard HDD storage

Standard HDD is an Azure storage type that should only be used to store SAP backups. It should only be used as base VHD for rather inactive systems, like retired systems used for looking up data here and there. But no active development, QA or production VMs should be based on that storage. Nor should database files being hosted on that storage

## Azure VM limits in storage traffic

The individual VM type you select plays a vital role in the storage bandwidth you can achieve. As limitations, you can note that:

- The smaller the VM, the fewer disks you can attach. This does not apply to ANF. Since you mount NFS or SMB shares, you don't encounter a limit of number of shared volumes to be attached
- VMs have I/O throughput and IOPS limits that easily could be exceeded with premium storage disks and Ultra disks
- With ANF, the traffic to the shared volumes is consuming the VM's network bandwidth and not storage bandwidth
- With large NFS volumes in the double digit TiB capacity space, the throughput accessing such a volume out of a single VM is going to plateau based on limits of Linux for a single session interacting with the shared volume.

As you up-size Azure VMs in the lifecycle of an SAP system, you should evaluate the IOPS and storage throughput limits of the new and larger VM type. In some cases, it also could make sense to adjust the storage configuration to the new capabilities of the Azure VM.

## Striping or not striping

Creating a stripe set out of multiple Azure disks into one larger volume allows you to accumulate the IOPS and throughput of the individual disks into one volume. It is used for Azure standard storage and Azure premium storage only. Azure Ultra disk where you can configure the throughput and IOPS independent of the capacity of a disk, does not require the usage of stripe sets. Shared volumes based on NFS or SMB can't be striped. Due to the non-linear nature of Azure premium storage throughput and IOPS, you can provision smaller capacity with the same IOPS and throughput than large single Azure premium storage disks. That is the method to achieve higher throughput or IOPS at lower cost using Azure premium storage. For example:

- Striping across two P15 premium storage disks gets you to a throughput of
- 250 MiB/sec. Such a volume is going to have 512 GiB capacity. If you want to have a single disk that gives you 250 MiB throughput per second, you would need to pick a P40 disk with 2 TiB capacity.
- Or you could achieve a throughput of 400 MiB/sec by striping four P10 premium storage disks with an overall capacity of 512 GiB by striping. If you would like to have a single disk with a minimum of 500 MiB throughput per second, you would need to pick a P60 premium storage disk with 8 TiB. Since costing or premium storage is near linear with the capacity, you can sense the cost savings by using striping.

Some rules need to be followed on striping:

- No in-VM configured storage should be used since Azure storage keeps the data redundant already
- The disks the stripe set is applied to, need to be of the same size

Striping across multiple smaller disks is the best way to achieve a good price/performance ratio using Azure premium storage. It is understood that striping has some additional deployment and management overhead.
