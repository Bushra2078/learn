You work as a support engineer supporting Azure infrastructure. You've been contacted by your web team about an issue with the website not responding. The web team have a pool of webservers behind a load balancer and public IP address.

In this exercise, you'll use what you've learned to go through steps to troubleshoot the connection issues to the virtual machines.

## Verify that the website can't be reached

 Use the Cloud Shell on the right.

1. Use this Azure CLI command to get the public IP address of the scale set.

    ```
    az network public-ip show \
    --resource-group <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> \
    --name webPublicIP \
    --query '[ipAddress]' \
    --output tsv
    ```

2. Copy the IP address, in a new tab in your browser, try to navigate to it.

## Check that Network Security Groups are configured correctly

1. In another browser tab, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.learn.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).

1. Search for **Network security groups**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/6-search-nsg.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the virtual machine scale set is detailed." lightbox="../media/6-search-nsg.png":::

1. Under **Services**, select **Network Security Groups**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-no-network-security-groups.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing that in this environment there are no NSGs created." lightbox="../media/6-no-network-security-groups.png":::

1. Select **webNetworkSecurityGroup**.

1. Check that internet traffic over port **80** is allowed by the Network Security Group.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-check-inbound-traffic-allowed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Network Security Group inbound rules are correct.":::

## Check the network settings for the virtual machines

1. On the left, select **Virtual Machines**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/6-check-virtual-machine-networking.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing an instance in the scale set highlighted." lightbox="../media/6-check-virtual-machine-networking.png":::

1. Select the first virtual machine listed, in the above example this is **webVirtualMachine1**. In your environment this could be different.

1. On the left, under **Settings**, select **Networking**.

1. Note that port 80 is allowed.

1. Repeat these steps for **webVirtualMachine2**.

## Check the load balancer

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Load balancers**, then under **Services**, select **Load balancers**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-search-load-balancers.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing searching for load balancers.":::

1. Select the **webLoadBalancer**.

1. On the left, under **Settings**, select **Frontend IP configuration**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/6-front-end-ip-configuration.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing  the frontend IP address highlighted.":::

1. Check that there is a frontend IP address, and that this is the IP you tested at the beginning of this exercise.

1. On the left, under **Settings**, select **Load balancing rules**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/6-load-balancing-rules.png" alt-text="Screen shot showing the load balancing rules.":::

   > [!NOTE] 
   > There is a rule for port **80** and port **443**.

1. On the left, select **Diagnose and solve problems**.

## Use the Diagnose and solve problems troubleshooter

1. Select the **No connectivity to the backend pool** troubleshooter.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/6-no-connectivity.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the No connectivity to backend pool troubleshooter.":::

1. In the **Tell us more about the problem you are experiencing** drop-down box, select **Intermittent connectivity**.

1. Scroll down and read the insight found.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-no-connectivity-back-end-pool.png" alt-text="Screen shot of the connectivity results showing the backend pool can't be connected to over port 443.":::

    The insight points to the fact that the backend instances in the pool aren't listening for port **443**. The website instances should be listening to port **80**. This insight points to a problem in the load balancer rule.
