Use these Try-This exercises to get some hands-on exerpience with Azure.

In this demonstration, we will configure the Bastion service, virtual machine updates, virtual machine extensions, and disk encryption. Optionally, we will use RDP to connect to a Windows virtual machine and SSH to connect to a Linux machine. 

## Task 1 - Use the Bastion service 

**Note:** This task requires a virtual machine. If you are doing the next task, virtual machine updates, use a Windows virtual machine and keep the session running. 

In this task, we will configure the Bastion service and connect to a virtual machine with service. 

**Configure the Bastion service**

1.	In the **Portal** navigate to your Windows virtual machine.
1.	Ensure the virtual machine is **Running**.
1.	Click **Connect** and select **Bastion**.
1.	Click **Use Bastion**. Note installing the service is only required once. 
1.	Because you are creating the Bastion service from the target virtual machine, mention that most of the networking information has automatically been filled in. Note the Bastion service will be assigned a public IP address. 
1.	To create the Bastion subnet in the virtual network, click **Manage subnet configuration**.
1.	On the virtual network subnet blade, click **+ Subnet**. 
1.	On the Add subnet page, type **AzureBastionSubnet** as the subnet name. Note this name cannot be changed. 
1.	Specify the address range in CIDR notation. For example, **10.1.1.0/27**.
1.	Click **Ok**, then click **Create**. It will take a few minutes for the service to deploy. 

**Connect to the virtual machine using Bastion**

1. From the target virtual machineâ€™s **Overview** blade, select **Connect** and then **Bastion**
1. On the **Connect to Bastion** page, enter the virtual machine login credentials.
