Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility into and control over the security of your Azure resources. Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps you safeguard VM data in Azure by providing visibility into the security settings of your VMs. When Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps safeguard your VMs, the following capabilities are available:

 -  OS security settings with the recommended configuration rules
 -  System security updates and critical updates that are missing
 -  Endpoint protection recommendations
 -  Disk encryption validation
 -  Vulnerability assessment and remediation
 -  Threat detection

**Set security policies to manage vulnerabilities for VMs**

You need to enable data collection so that Microsoft Defender for Cloud can gather the information it needs to provide recommendations and alerts based on the security policy you configure. In the following figure, data collection has been turned on.

A security policy defines the set of controls recommended for resources within the specified subscription or resource group. Before enabling a security policy, you need to enable data collection. Microsoft Defender for Cloud collects data from your VMs to assess their security state, provide security recommendations, and alert you to threats. In Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you define policies for your Azure subscriptions or resource groups according to your company’s security needs and the types of applications or sensitivity of data in each subscription.

Security Center analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Microsoft Defender for Cloud identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations. The recommendations guide you through the process of configuring the needed controls.

After setting a security policy, Microsoft Defender for Cloud analyzes the security state of your resources to identify potential vulnerabilities. It depicts recommendations in a table format, where each line represents one recommendation. The example below of recommendations for Azure VMs and what each will do if you apply it. When you select a recommendation, Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides information about how you can implement that recommendation.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud also monitors and analyzes the enabled security policies to identify potential vulnerabilities. On the **Resource group** blade, you can check the security state of a resource along with any issues.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud threat detection works by automatically collecting security information from your Azure resources, the network, and connected partner solutions. It analyzes this information, often correlating information from multiple sources, to identify threats. Microsoft Defender for Cloud prioritizes alerts along with recommendations on how to remediate the threats.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud employs advanced security analytics that go far beyond signature-based approaches. Microsoft Defender for Cloud takes advantage of breakthroughs in big data and machine learning technologies to evaluate events across the entire cloud fabric—detecting threats that would be impossible to identify via manual approaches and predicting the evolution of attacks. These security analytics include:

 -  Integrated threat intelligence. Seeks known malicious hackers by taking advantage of global threat intelligence from Microsoft products and services, the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit, the Microsoft Security Response Center, and external feeds.
 -  Behavioral analytics. Applies known patterns to discover malicious behavior.
 -  Anomaly detection. Uses statistical profiling to build a historical baseline. It sends alerts on deviations from established baselines that conform to potential attack vectors.

Using these analytics, Microsoft Defender for Cloud can help disrupt the kill chain by adding detection in different phases of the kill chain, as the following figure depicts.

The preceding figure depicts some common alerts for each phase, and several more types of alerts exist. Microsoft Defender for Cloud also correlates alerts and creates a security incident. Security incidents give you a better view of which alerts belong to the same attack campaign.
