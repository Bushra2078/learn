In this module, you learned how to design a solution to log and monitor Azure resources. You reviewed data sources for Azure Monitor and the two primary components of the platform, Logs and Metrics. You discovered how Logs and Metrics data can be collected, analyzed, viewed, and acted upon to support different scenarios. You explored how to use workspaces to monitor data with Azure Monitor Logs (Log Analytics). You designed a strategy to use Azure Workbooks, Application Insights, and Azure Data Explorer to analyze infrastructure and application performance and availability.
