Suppose you work for Tailwind Traders that is moving its systems to Azure, with a mixture of IaaS and PaaS services. In its previous environment, the organization had several instances where application performance was degraded, or systems became entirely unavailable. There was an extended delay to identify and resolve the issues. This situation affected customers' ability to access their accounts and led to poor user satisfaction.

The organization wants to design a monitoring strategy that performs full-stack monitoring across all solutions that it uses. There should also be insights and alerting into the collected data. The organization wants to quickly identify and minimize poor performance and system failures in the future. The practice of continuous monitoring must include analysis of platform metrics and logs to get visibility into the health and performance of services that are part of the architecture.

In this module, you'll explore the monitoring solutions available in Azure. You'll assess Azure Monitor and its features such as Application Insights and Azure Monitor Logs to analyze infrastructure and application performance and availability.
