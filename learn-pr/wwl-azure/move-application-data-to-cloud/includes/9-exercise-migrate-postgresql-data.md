In this exercise, you'll practice migrating a local PostgreSQL database (in a virtual machine) to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL service. You'll use the Database Migration Service to assess the migration and then use the service to move the database to Azure.

To complete this exercise, you'll need an Azure subscription. If you don't have one, the exercise provides instructions for signing up for a free or student account.
