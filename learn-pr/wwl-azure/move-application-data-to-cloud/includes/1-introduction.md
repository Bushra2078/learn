Any migration solution would be incomplete without moving data. Thankfully, Azure has robust data options that are designed to meet even the most demanding workloads. Azure also provides tooling to help make your migration more straightforward.

In this module, we'll explore some tools you can use to migrate your data. We'll look at how to create an Azure SQL database and configure that for use with your solution. Azure also supports storing and accessing large files in its data offerings, and we'll take a look at how to manage large files on Azure.

Keeping your data secure and moving data quickly is essential for modern workloads. We'll explore both of these topics as we move through the units in this module. This will help you think about security and optimization as you design your solution and do your migration.
