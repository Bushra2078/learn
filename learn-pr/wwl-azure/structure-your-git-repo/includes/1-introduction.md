As a version control system, Git is easy to get started with but challenging to master.

While there's no one way to implement Git in the right way, many techniques can help you scale the implementation of Git across the organization.

Simple things like structuring your code into micro repos, selecting a lean branching and merging model, and using pull requests for code review can make your teams more productive.
