  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of these statements best describes autoscaling?"
    choices:
    - content: "Autoscaling requires an administrator to actively monitor the workload on a system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Autoscaling is an automated process that doesn't require manual intervention."
    - content: "Autoscaling is a scale out/scale in solution."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The system can scale out when specified resource metrics indicate increasing usage, and scale in when these metrics drop."
    - content: "Scaling up/scale down provides better availability than autoscaling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Autoscaling increases availability by adding more instances of services. If one of these instances fails, the others should still be available."
  - content: "Which of these scenarios is a suitable candidate for autoscaling?"
    choices:
    - content: "The number of users requiring access to an application varies according to a regular schedule. For example, more users use the system on a Friday than other days of the week."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Changes in application load that are predictable are good candidates for autoscaling."
    - content: "The system is subject to a sudden influx of requests that grinds your system to a halt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The increasing burst of activity could be caused by a Denial of Service attack that is attempting to overwhelm your system. Autoscaling wouldn't solve the problem."
    - content: "Your organization is running a promotion and expects to see increased traffic to their web site for the next couple of weeks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Manual scaling is a better option here since this is a one-off event with a known duration."
  - content: "There are multiple rules in an autoscale profile. Which of the following scale operations will run if any of the rule conditions are met?"
    choices:
    - content: "scale-out"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Scale-out operations will trigger if any of the rule conditions are met."
    - content: "scale-in"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Scale-in operations will only trigger if all of the rule conditions are met."
    - content: "scale-out/in"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. These are two scale operations each with different sets of rules and threshold requirements."
