  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of these statements best describes autoscaling?"
    choices:
    - content: "Autoscaling is a scale up/scale down solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Autoscaling is a scale in/scale out solution. It adds and removes instances of resources rather than migrating to more powerful hardware."
    - content: "Autoscaling requires an administrator to actively monitor the workload on a system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Autoscaling is an automated process that doesn't require manual intervention."
    - content: "Autoscaling is a scale out/scale in solution."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The system can scale out when specified resource metrics indicate increasing usage, and scale in when these metrics drop."
    - content: "Scaling up/scale down provides better availability than autoscaling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Autoscaling increases availability by adding more instances of services. If one of these instances fails, the others should still be available."
  - content: "Which of these scenarios is a suitable candidate for autoscaling?"
    choices:
    - content: "The number of users requiring access to an application varies according to a regular schedule. For example, more users use the system on a Friday than other days of the week."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct."
    - content: "The system is subject to a sudden influx of requests that grinds your system to a halt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The increasing burst of activity could be caused by a Denial of Service attack that is attempting to overwhelm your system. Autoscaling wouldn't solve the problem."
    - content: "Over time, your service is becoming more popular, and you need to handle the increasing traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In this scenario, manual scaling is likely to be a better option. The increased demand is long-lived and increasing."
    - content: "Your organization is running a promotion and expects to see increased traffic to their web site for the next couple of weeks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Manual scaling is a better option here since this is a one-off event with a known duration."
  - content: "There are cases where you may have to set multiple rules in a profile. Below is a group of four autoscale rules contained in a single profile.* If CPU < 30 %, scale-in by 1* If Memory < 50%, scale-in by 1* If CPU > 75%, scale-out by 1* If Memory > 75%, scale-out by 1**True** or **False**: The app will scale out or in if a single corresponding scale-out or scale-in condition is met."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. On *scale out*, autoscale runs if any single rule is met. On *scale-in*, autoscale require all rules to be met."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. On *scale out*, autoscale runs if any single rule is met. On *scale-in*, autoscale require all rules to be met."
