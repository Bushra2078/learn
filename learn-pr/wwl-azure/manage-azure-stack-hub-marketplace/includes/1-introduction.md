You use Azure Stack Hub Marketplace to create new resources and deploy new apps or browse and choose the items you want to use. To use a marketplace item, users must subscribe to an offer that grants them access to that item.

As an Azure Stack Hub operator, you decide which items to add (publish) to Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. You can publish items such as databases, app services, and more. Publishing makes items visible to all your users. You can publish custom items that you create, or you can publish items from a growing list of Azure Marketplace items. When you publish an item to Azure Stack Hub Marketplace, users can see it within five minutes.
