In this module, you learned how to perform the most common Azure Stack HCI VM management tasks by using Windows Admin Center; configure Azure Stack HCI affinity, load balancing, and GPU support; implement a VDI deployment on an Azure Stack HCI cluster; and protect Azure Stack HCI workloads by using trusted enterprise virtualization. 

Using what you've learned, you determined that you can use Azure Stack HCI to simplify Contoso's operational model and provide the hosting platform for a wide range of VM-based workloads, including: 

- VMs hosting SQL Server instances that must run on separate cluster nodes
- VMs that run complex financial modeling software that require GPU acceleration
- VMs that are part of VDI desktop collections
- VMs that require HVCI-based protection
