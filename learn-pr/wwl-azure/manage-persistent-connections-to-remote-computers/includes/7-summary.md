In this module, you learned that using a persistent connection allows you to interactively query and manage a remote computer. You learned how to establish and manage persistent connections to remote computers, known as Windows PowerShell sessions or PSSessions. The following are the key takeaways:

- Windows PowerShell can create persistent connections, which are known as sessions, or more accurately, PSSessions. The PS designation signifies Windows PowerShell and differentiates these sessions from other kinds of sessions that might be present in other technologies, such as a Remote Desktop Services (RDS) session.

- Use the **New-PSSession** command to create a persistent connection.

- Run the **Disconnect-PSSession** command to disconnect from the PSSession.

- Implicit remoting brings a copy of a serverâ€™s Windows PowerShell tools to your local computer.
