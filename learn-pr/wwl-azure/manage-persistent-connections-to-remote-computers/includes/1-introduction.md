In this learning pathway, you've learned that each remoting command you used created a connection, used it, and then closed it. However, as previously discussed, this approach doesn't provide the option to persist session data across remote connections. Using a persistent connection allows you to interactively query and manage a remote computer. In this module, you'll learn how to establish and manage persistent connections to remote computers, known as Windows PowerShell sessions or PSSessions.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the purpose of persistent connections.
- Create and use a PSSession.
- Explain how to disconnect from PSSessions.
- Explain the concept of implicit remoting.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with:

- Windows networking technologies and implementation
- Windows Server administration, maintenance, and troubleshooting
- Windows PowerShell and its commands to perform specific tasks
- PowerShell cmdlets used for system administration tasks related to Active Directory, network configuration, server administration, and Windows 10 device administration
- Windows PowerShell pipeline, PowerShell providers, and PowerShell drives 
- CIM and WMI technologies
- Using variables, arrays, hash tables, and scripting constructs in Windows PowerShell
