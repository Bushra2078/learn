It's time to programmatically check out how to create our Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB databases, collections and add some data.

This exercise can be completed using a Microsoft Learn *sandbox*, which provides a temporary Azure subscription. To activate the sandbox subscription, you must sign in using a Microsoft account. The sandbox subscription will be automatically deleted when you complete this module. After the sandbox has been activated, [sign into the Azure portal using the credentials for your sandbox subscription](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). Ensure you're working in the **Microsoft Learn Sandbox** directory - indicated at the top right of the portal under your user ID. If not, select the user icon and switch directory.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer, you can use your own Azure subscription. To do so, [sign into the Azure portal using credentials for your subscription](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true). Ensure you are working in the directory containing your subscription - indicated at the top right under your user ID. If not, select the user icon and switch directory.

In this exercise, we'll start by using the MongoDB drivers and programmatically create our databases, collections and then insert and query some data in Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB like we would for any MongoDB server.  We'll then use the extension commands to have better control of our sharding key and throughput when we create our collections.
