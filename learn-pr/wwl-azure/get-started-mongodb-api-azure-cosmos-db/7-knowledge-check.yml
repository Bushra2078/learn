  questions:
  - content: "You created an Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB account called **ContosoMongoDBAccounts01** using version 4.0, what would the account's host address be?"
    choices:
    - content: "contosoMongoDBAccounts01.documents.azure.com"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your account URI will will be mongo.cosmos.azure.com appended to your account name for version 3.6+. This would actually be the correct URI if we would have created an account with version 3.2"
    - content: "contosoMongoDBAccounts01.mongo.cosmos.azure.com"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Your account URI will will be mongo.cosmos.azure.com appended to your account name for version 3.6+."
    - content: "contosoMongoDBAccounts01.mongodb.cosmos.azure.com"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your account URI will will be mongo.cosmos.azure.com appended to your account name for version 3.6+."
  - content: "Which of the following statements is true?"

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Developers should be able to use their current drivers and tools."
    - content: "Upgrading between Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB Server versions could take several hours depending on the databases sizes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Since all versions use the same code base, upgrading versions should incur zero downtime."
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB accounts benefit from automatic and transparent sharding."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. While offerings like MongoDB Atlas require you to specify and manage scaling to a horizontal scaling, the Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB automatically manages all sharding and its infrastructure behinds the scenes for you."
