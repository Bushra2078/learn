An Azure Digital Twins solution can use Azure Functions and other Azure services to import data from upstream services and to export data downstream services.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to extend the IoT solution to include business data from various sources by implementing Azure Digital Twins. You decide to gain experience by developing an Azure Digital Twins solution that includes data ingestion from IoT Hub and data egress to Time Series Insights.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:

 -  Build an Azure Digital Twins graph using digital twin instances.
 -  Implement graph interaction that includes queries and digital twin property updates.
 -  Ingest IoT device messages by using an Azure function.
 -  Configure Azure Digital Twins routes and endpoints to publish telemetry to Time Series Insights using Azure Functions and Event Grid.

By the end of this module, you will be able to build and manage an Azure Digital Twins solution that connects upstream to IoT Hub for data inputs and downstream to Time Series Insights for data analysis.
