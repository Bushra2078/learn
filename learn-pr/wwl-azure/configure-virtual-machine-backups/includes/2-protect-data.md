You can protect your data by taking backups at regular intervals. There are several backup options available for VMs, depending on your use-case.

## Azure Backup

For backing up Azure VMs running production workloads, use Azure Backup. Azure Backup supports application-consistent backups for both Windows and Linux VMs. Azure Backup creates recovery points that are stored in geo-redundant recovery vaults. When you restore from a recovery point, you can restore the whole VM or just specific files.

## Azure Site Recovery

Azure Site Recovery protects your VMs from a major disaster scenario when a whole region experiences an outage due to major natural disaster or widespread service interruption. You can configure Azure Site Recovery for your VMs so that you can recover your application with a single click in matter of minutes. You can replicate to an Azure region of your choice.

## Managed disk snapshots

In development and test environments, snapshots provide a quick and simple option for backing up VMs that use Managed Disks. A managed disk snapshot is a read-only full copy of a managed disk that is stored as a standard managed disk by default. With snapshots, you can back up your managed disks at any point in time. These snapshots exist independent of the source disk and can be used to create new managed disks. They are billed based on the used size. For example, if you create a snapshot of a managed disk with provisioned capacity of 64 GiB and actual used data size of 10 GiB, that snapshot is billed only for the used data size of 10 GiB.

## Images

Managed disks also support creating a managed custom image. You can create an image from your custom VHD in a storage account or directly from a generalized (sysprepped) VM. This process captures a single image. This image contains all managed disks associated with a VM, including both the OS and data disks. This managed custom image enables creating hundreds of VMs using your custom image without the need to copy or manage any storage accounts.

## Images versus snapshots

It's important to understand the difference between images and snapshots. With managed disks, you can take an image of a generalized VM that has been deallocated. This image includes all of the disks attached to the VM. You can use this image to create a VM, and it includes all of the disks.

 -  A snapshot is a copy of a disk at the point in time the snapshot is taken. It applies only to one disk. If you have a VM that has one disk (the OS disk), you can take a snapshot or an image of it and create a VM from either the snapshot or the image.
 -  A snapshot doesn't have awareness of any disk except the one it contains. This makes it problematic to use in scenarios that require the coordination of multiple disks, such as striping. Snapshots would need to be able to coordinate with each other and this is currently not supported.
