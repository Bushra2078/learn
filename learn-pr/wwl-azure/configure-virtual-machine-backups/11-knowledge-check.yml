  questions:
  - content: "A company has several Azure VMs that are currently running production workloads. There is a mix of production Windows Server and Linux servers. Which of the following is the best choice for production backups?"
    choices:
    - content: "Managed snapshots"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An Azure Snapshot is a read-only copy of the existing disk in the Microsoft Azure Cloud. This snapshot can be used as a backup or to create a virtual machine. However, the snapshot is only for a single point in time and is not the best choice for production environments."
    - content: "Azure Backup"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Backup is the best option for production workloads."
    - content: "Azure Site Recovery"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Site Recovery would be better for scenarios involving replication, failover, and fallback."
  - content: "Which of these options is recommended to backup a database disk used for development?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machine backup"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Is there a better choice for just the database backup?"
    - content: "Azure Site Recovery"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Site Recovery would be better for scenarios involving replication, failover, and fallback."
    - content: "Disk snapshot"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Snapshots can be taken at any time and used to quickly restore the database data disk."
  - content: "A malware attack has deleted several virtual machine backups. How long are items available in the soft delete state?"
    choices:
    - content: "7 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Soft delete provides for longer backup recovery."
    - content: "14 days"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Backup data is retained for 14 additional days, allowing the recovery of that backup item with no data loss."
    - content: "30 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Soft delete does not provide for a 30 day recovery period."
