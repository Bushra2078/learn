  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What are two benefits of Traffic Manager?"
    choices:
    - content: "Distribution of traffic and continuous monitoring of endpoint health.\\{\\{Correct, Distribution of traffic according to one of several traffic-routing methods and continuous monitoring of endpoint health and automatic failover when endpoints fail.\\}\\}"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "correct choice"
    - content: "Resolution of DNS queries and reduced need for DNS servers.\\{\\{Incorrect, Traffic Manager uses DNS to direct clients to specific service endpoints based on the rules of the traffic-routing method, it does not resolve queries itself.\\}\\}"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "incorrect choice"
    - content: "Supports one traffic-routing method and integrates with DNS.\\{\\{Incorrect, Azure Traffic Manager supports six traffic-routing methods. The traffic-routing method determines which endpoint is returned in the DNS response.\\}\\}"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "incorrect choice"
  - content: "Which traffic-routing method should be use when end users need to use the \"closest\" endpoint for the lowest network latency?"
    choices:
    - content: "Performance\\{\\{Correct, Use when you have endpoints in different geographic locations, and you want end users to use the \"closest\" endpoint for the lowest network latency.\\}\\}"
      isCorrect: true

      explanation: "incorrect choice"
    - content: "Priority\\{\\{Incorrect, Select this routing method when you want to have a primary service endpoint for all traffic. You can provide multiple backup endpoints in case the primary or one of the backup endpoints is unavailable.\\}\\}"
