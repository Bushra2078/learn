The following workflow and component diagram outlines how playbooks can run in different circumstances, one after another. In the workflow, Ansible playbooks:

:::image type="content" source="../media/ansible-workflow-015a9ae4.png" alt-text="The Ansible workflow has three general areas. On the left is a box containing a user and three Ansible playbooks. In order, they provision resources, configure application, and future configuration to scale. Each playbook has an arrow that points to a box in the middle of the graphic containing Ansible Automation components, which are Roles, Modules, APIs, Plugins, and Inventory. These two boxes are within a control machine box. From the components box, three arrows point to Azure resources, an application, and three images representing the scaling of the application.":::


1.  Provision resources. Playbooks can provision resources. In the following diagram, playbooks create load-balancer virtual networks, network security groups, and virtual machine scale sets on Azure.
2.  Configure the application. Playbooks can deploy applications to run services, such as installing Apache Tomcat on a Linux machine to allow you to run a web application.
3.  Manage future configurations to scale. Playbooks can alter configurations by applying playbooks to existing resources and applicationsâ€”in this instance, to scale the VMs.

In all cases, Ansible makes use of core components such as roles, modules, APIs, plugins, inventory, and other components.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Ansible manages machines using the *ssh* protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need to maintain and run commands from any central server. Instead, there's a control machine with Ansible installed, and from which playbooks are run.
