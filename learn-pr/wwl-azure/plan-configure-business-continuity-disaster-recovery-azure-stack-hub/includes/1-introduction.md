You enable the Infrastructure Backup Service from the administrator portal so that Azure Stack Hub can generate infrastructure backups. The hardware partner can use these backups to restore your environment using cloud recovery if a catastrophic failure. However, administrators and users are responsible for backing up and restoring IaaS and PaaS resources separately from the infrastructure backup processes.

In this module, you will learn the best practices for deploying and managing Azure Stack Hub to help mitigate data loss if there's a catastrophic failure.

This module aligns with the exam AZ-600: Configuring and Operating a Hybrid Cloud with Microsoft Azure Stack Hub.
