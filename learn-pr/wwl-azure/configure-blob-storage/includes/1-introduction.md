Azure Blob Storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured object data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data. 

In this module, your media company has an extensive library of video clips that are accessed thousands of times a day. The company relies on you to configure Blob Storage for the video data. You plan to use access tiers to reduce cost and improve performance. You're developing a lifecycle management strategy for the older videos. Your plan also includes configuring object replication for failover.
