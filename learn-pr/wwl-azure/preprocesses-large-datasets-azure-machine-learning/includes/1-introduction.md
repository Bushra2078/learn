Organizations can efficiently preprocess large amounts of data in Azure Machine Learning.

Imagine you work as a data scientist for an air carrier company. The analytics team gives you access to a large volume of flight data that is stored in one folder. They want you to analyze this data to extract insights. Together with the team you decide to do everything within Azure Machine Learning to keep the data within one environment for preprocessing, model training, and deployment. As a first step, you wonder how to load this data into Azure Machine Learning to preprocess the data.

After this module, you'll be able to choose the appropriate approach for preprocessing your data when using it to train compute-intensive models.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- When to use machine learning or deep learning.
- How to efficiently store large data.
- How to optimize data loading and preprocessing.
