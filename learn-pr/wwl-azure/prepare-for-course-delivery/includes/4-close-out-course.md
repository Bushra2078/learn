Your course has certainly helped to build your students technical skills and knowledge and the materials you have been leveraging from Microsoft are aligned to industry recognized certifications. These certifications can augment your students’ degree path and validate the skills they have gained, skills that are needed to be successful across a variety of in-demand technical careers. 

Demand for technical certifications is growing. For students who are looking to stand out in the job market, and for you their faculty member looking to support them, technical certifications can be a differentiator. For a student, adding a Microsoft Certification to their profile alongside artifacts from class demonstrates not only their learning from coursework, but also a commitment to keeping up with the evolving forefront of technology.  

Let’s work on wrapping up the term and supporting your students so that they can be successful on their certification exams.

Checklist for closing out the term: 

1. Review the certification plan with your students – ensure expectations are clear

   - Ensure that you are explicit with your students about the date on which or by which they need to take their exam and any expectation you may have around knowing the results of their exam 

2. Help improve MSLE
