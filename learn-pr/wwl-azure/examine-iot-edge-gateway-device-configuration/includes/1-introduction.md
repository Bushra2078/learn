Azure IoT Edge gateway devices can be configured using patterns that support various business conditions.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to implement key portions of the solution directly on devices using Azure IoT Edge technologies. Understanding the capabilities of an Azure IoT gateway device will enable the team to support the company's device-side architecture. You decide to examine the configuration patterns and device networking requirements associated with an Azure IoT Edge gateway device implementation.<br>

In this module, you will:

 -  Review the IoT Edge device gateway patterns.
 -  Examine how to authenticate the devices that are connected to a gateway device.
 -  Examine the configuration of a transparent gateway device.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the various gateway patterns and the device networking requirements that they support.
