The Azure portal provides out-of-the-box continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on your development machine. Connect your web app with any of the above sources and App Service will do the rest for you by auto-syncing code and any future changes on the code into the web app. Furthermore, with Azure DevOps, you can define your own build and release process that compiles your source code, runs the tests, builds a release, and finally deploys the release into your web app every time you commit the code. All that happens implicitly without any need to intervene.

## Automated deployment

Automated deployment, or continuous integration, is a process used to push out new features and bug fixes in a fast and repetitive pattern with minimal impact on end users. Azure supports automated deployment directly from several sources. The following options are available:

 -  **Azure DevOps**: You can push your code to Azure DevOps (previously known as Visual Studio Team Services), build your code in the cloud, run the tests, generate a release from the code, and finally, push your code to an Azure Web App.
 -  **GitHub**: Azure supports automated deployment directly from GitHub. When you connect your GitHub repository to Azure for automated deployment, any changes you push to your production branch on GitHub will be automatically deployed for you.
 -  **Bitbucket**: With its similarities to GitHub, you can configure an automated deployment with Bitbucket.

## Manual deployment

There are a few options that you can use to manually push your code to Azure:

 -  **Git**: App Service web apps feature a Git URL that you can add as a remote repository. Pushing to the remote repository will deploy your app.
 -  **CLI**: `webapp up` is a feature of the command-line interface that packages your app and deploys it. Deployment can include creating a new App Service web app.
 -  **Visual Studio**: Visual Studio features an App Service deployment wizard that can walk you through the deployment process.<br>
 -  **FTP/S**: FTP or FTPS is a traditional way of pushing your code to many hosting environments, including App Service.
