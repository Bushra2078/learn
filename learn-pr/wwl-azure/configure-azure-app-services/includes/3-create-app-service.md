When creating an App Service, you will need to specify a resource group and service plan. Then there are few other configuration choices. You may need to ask your developer for assistance in completing this information.

 -  **Name**. The name must be unique and will be used to locate your app. For example, webappces1.azurewebsites.net. You can map a custom domain name, if you prefer to use that instead.
 -  **Publish**. The App service can host either Code or a Docker Container.
 -  **Runtime stack**. The software stack to run the app, including the language and SDK versions. For Linux apps and custom container apps, you can also set an optional start-up command or file. Choices include: .NET Core, .NET Framework, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Various versions of each are available.
 -  **Operating system**. Choices are Linux and Windows.
 -  **Region**. Your choice will affect app service plan availability.

## Application settings

Once your app service is created, additional configuration information is available.

Certain configuration settings can be included in the developer's code or configurated in the app service. Here are a few interesting settings.

 -  **Always On**. Keep the app loaded even when there's no traffic. It's required for continuous WebJobs or for WebJobs that are triggered using a CRON expression.
 -  **ARR affinity**. In a multi-instance deployment, ensure that the client is routed to the same instance for the life of the session. You can set this option to Off for stateless application,
 -  **Connection strings**. Connection strings are encrypted at rest and transmitted over an encrypted channel.
