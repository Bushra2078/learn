Azure Architects are interested in solutions that make it easier to deploy and manage their web, mobile, and API applications.

In this module, your company is doing consumer research, and your team manages the on-premises servers. The servers you administer run the entire company infrastructure from web servers to databases. However, the hardware is aging and starting to struggle to keep up with some of the new data analysis applications being deployed.

Rather than upgrade the hardware, the company has decided to deploy Azure App Service where possible. As the administrator, you're responsible for deploying App Service. Your tasks include app configuration settings, deployment slots, security settings, and custom domain names. You're also responsible for application backup, recovery, and monitoring.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Identify features and usage cases for Azure App Service.
- Create an app with App Service.
- Configure deployment settings, specifically deployment slots.
- Secure your App Service app.
- Configure custom domain names.
- Back up and restore your App Service app.
- Configure Azure Application Insights.
