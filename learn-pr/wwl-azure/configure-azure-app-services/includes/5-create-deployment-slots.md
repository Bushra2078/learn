When you deploy your web app, web app on Linux, mobile back end, or API app to Azure App Service, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot when you're running in the **Standard**, **Premium**, or **Isolated** App Service plan tier. Deployment slots are live apps with their own hostnames. App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.

## Deployment slot advantages

Using separate staging and production slots has several advantages.

 -  You can validate app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot.
 -  Deploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production ensures that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production. This eliminates downtime when you deploy your app. The traffic redirection is seamless, and no requests are dropped because of swap operations. This entire workflow can be automated by configuring Auto Swap when pre-swap validation is not needed.
 -  After a swap, the slot with previously staged app now has the previous production app. If the changes swapped into the production slot are not as you expected, you can perform the same swap immediately to get your “last known good site” back.

Auto swap streamlines Azure DevOps scenarios where you want to deploy your app continuously with zero cold starts and zero downtime for customers of the app. When auto swap is enabled from a slot into production, every time you push your code changes to that slot, App Service automatically swaps the app into production after it's warmed up in the source slot. Auto swap isn't currently supported in web apps on Linux.

> [!NOTE]
> Each App Service plan mode supports a different number of deployment slots.
