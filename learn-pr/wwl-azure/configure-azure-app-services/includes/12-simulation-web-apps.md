## Lab scenario

Your organization is migrating on-premises web apps to Azure. As the Azure Adminstrator you need to:
+ Hosting web sites running on Windows servers using the PHP runtime stack. 
+ How to implement DevOps practices by leveraging Azure web apps deployment slots.

## Objectives

+ **Task 1**: Create an Azure web app.
    + Create a web app using the Azure portal. 
    + The web app should run on Windows and use the PHP 7.4 runtime stack. 
+ **Task 2**: Create a staging deployment slot.
    + Verify there is a production deployment slot.
    + Create a new staging deployment slot. 
+ **Task 3**: Configure web app deployment settings.
    + Deploy the web app from a local Git.
    + Provide the authentication credentials. 
+ **Task 4**: Deploy code to the staging deployment slot.
    + Use Azure PowerShell to clone the remote repository and set the local path.
    + Add the remote git using the authentication credentials.
    + Display the default web page in a new browser tab.
    + Push the sample web app code from the local repository to the Azure web app staging deployment slot.
+ **Task 5**: Swap the staging slots.
    + Swap the deploymnt slots.
    + Verify the default web page has been replaced with the Hello World page.
+ **Task 6**: Configure and test autoscaling of the Azure web app.
    + Configure a custom autoscale rule on the production deployment slot.
    + The scale rule should use the CPU percentage to increase the resource count.
    + Use Azure PowerShell to start an infinite loop that sends the HTTP requests to the web app.
    + Confirm that the resource count automatically scales.
