New deployment slots can be empty or cloned. When you clone a configuration from another deployment slot, the cloned configuration is editable. Some configuration elements follow the content across a swap (not slot specific), whereas other configuration elements stay in the same slot after a swap (slot specific). Deployment slot settings fall into three categories.

 -  Slot-specific app settings and connection strings, if applicable.
 -  Continuous deployment settings, if enabled.
 -  App Service authentication settings, if enabled.
