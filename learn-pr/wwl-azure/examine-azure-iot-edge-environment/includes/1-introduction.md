Azure IoT Edge technologies provide the ability to bring cloud service capabilities to the local device.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to implement key portions of the solution directly on devices using Azure IoT Edge technologies. Understanding how Azure IoT Edge works will help the team to proceed efficiently once the implementation begins. You decide to examine the features, capabilities, and components of the Azure IoT Edge environment.

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine the features and capabilities of Azure IoT Edge.
 -  Examine the IoT Edge runtime and modules.
 -  Examine IoT Edge security and certificates.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the components of an Azure IoT Edge environment and the capabilities that it provides to the local device.
