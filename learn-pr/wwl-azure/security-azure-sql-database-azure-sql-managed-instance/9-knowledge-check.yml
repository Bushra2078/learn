      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Scanning a data source in Microsoft Purview captures technical metadata, extracts schema, and applies classifications to your data."
  - content: "What is the purpose of environment automation and validation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enables manual creation and teardown of environments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Environment automation and validation aim to automate the creation and teardown of environments."
    - content: "Enables the creation of unstable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Environment automation and validation aim to deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Environment automation and validation aim to automate the creation and teardown of environments to deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
  - content: "What is the purpose of authentication in a secure database?"
    choices:
    - content: "To limit the permissions granted to the application"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a best practice for application authentication, but not the purpose of authentication in a secure database."
    - content: "To determine what actions a user is allowed to perform"

      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the purpose of authorization, not authentication."
    - content: "To prove the user is who they claim to be"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Create users in each database"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Don't create users in the Master db. Instead, contained users should be created on each database."
  - content: "What is the purpose of deterministic encryption?"
    choices:
    - content: "To prevent searching, grouping, indexing, and joining on encrypted columns"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This also describes randomized encryption."
    - content: "To encrypt data in a less predictable manner"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes randomized encryption."
    - content: "To enable the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Deterministic encryption is used for columns that will be used as search or grouping parameters, such as a government ID number, to enable automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
