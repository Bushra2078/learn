In this unit, you'll connect your Key Vault to your Spring Petclinic microservices using a managed identity. The managed identity will be assigned to your application. The process will also create a Service Principal for your application in Azure Active Directory.

The apps deployed as the Spring Petclinic microservices will connect to the newly created Key Vault using a managed identity. The process of creating a managed identity will automatically create an Azure Active Directory service principal for your application. Managed identities minimize the overhead associated with managing service principals, since their secrets used for authentication are automatically rotated. The procedure below assigns a managed identity to a Spring Apps service application.

You'll assign an identity to the microservices used by the database:

 -  spring-petclinic-customers-service
 -  spring-petclinic-vets-service
 -  spring-petclinic-visits-service

1.  Secret rotation is handled by Managed Identity. The procedure below assigns a Managed Identity to an application in Spring Apps service by assigning an identity to each of the apps.
    
    ```Bash
    az spring app identity assign \
        --service $SPRING_APPS_SERVICE \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --name customers-service \
        --system-assigned
    
    az spring app identity assign \
        --service $SPRING_APPS_SERVICE \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --name visits-service \
        --system-assigned
    
    az spring app identity assign \
        --service $SPRING_APPS_SERVICE \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --name vets-service \
        --system-assigned
    
    ```

2.  Export the identity details to a separate environment variable for each of the apps so you can reuse it in the next part of the exercise.
    
    ```Bash
    customers_service_id=$(az spring app identity show \
        --service $SPRING_APPS_SERVICE \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --name customers-service \
        --output tsv \
        --query principalId)
    
    vets_service_id=$(az spring app identity show \
        --service $SPRING_APPS_SERVICE \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --name vets-service \
        --output tsv \
        --query principalId)
    
    visits_service_id=$(az spring app identity show \
        --service $SPRING_APPS_SERVICE \
        --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
        --name visits-service \
        --output tsv \
        --query principalId)
    
    ```
