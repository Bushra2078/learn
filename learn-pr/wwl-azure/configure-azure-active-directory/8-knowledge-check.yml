  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Users want to sign-in to devices, apps, and services from anywhere. They want to sign-in using an organizational work or school account instead of a personal account. IT requires that corporate assets are protected and that devices meet standards for security and compliance. What should be done?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add the device in Azure Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To get a device underthe control of Azure AD you must either join or register the device."
    - content: "Join the device to Azure Active Directory"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Registering a device to Azure AD enables you to manage a device’s identity. Azure AD device registration provides the device with an identity that is used to authenticate the device when a user signs-in to Azure AD. You can use the identity to enable or disable a device."
    - content: "Register a device in Azure Active Directory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Joining a device is an extension to registering a device. Joining provides the benefits of registering and changes the local state of a device. Changing the local state enables your users to sign-in to a device using an organizational work or school account instead of a personal account."

    choices:
    - content: "An Azure tenant"

    - content: "An Azure identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An identity is an object that can be authenticated. An identity can be a user with a username and password. Identities also include applications or other servers that might require authentication through secret keys or certificates."
    - content: "An Azure Active Directory account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An Azure AD Account is an identity created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Office 365. Identities are stored in Azure AD and accessible to your organization's cloud service subscriptions. This account is also sometimes called a Work or school account."
  - content: "When Self-Service Password Reset is enabled for an Azure Active Directory organization..."
    choices:
    - content: "Users can change their password when they're signed in."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Even without SSPR enabled, users can change their password when they're signed in to Azure AD."
    - content: "Admins can reset their password by using one authentication method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. At least two methods are required to authenticate a password reset for an admin account."
    - content: "Users can reset their password if they can't sign in."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If the user passes the authentication tests, then they can reset their password."
