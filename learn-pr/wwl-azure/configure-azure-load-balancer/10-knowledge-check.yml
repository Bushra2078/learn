  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "A company provides customers a virtual network in the cloud. Which type of Azure load balancer should be used to direct traffic to resources inside the virtual networks?"
    choices:
    - content: "An external load balancer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  Azure has two types of load balancers: external and internal."
    - content: "An internal load balancer."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An internal load balancer directs traffic only to resources that are inside a virtual network or that use a VPN to access Azure infrastructure."
    - content: "A public load balancer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A public load balancer maps the public IP address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP address and port number of the VM."
  - content: "What is the default distribution type for traffic through a load balancer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Source IP affinity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Affinity specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same virtual machine."
    - content: "Three-tuple hash"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A three-tuple hash is not the distribution type."
    - content: "Five-tuple hash"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The load balancer uses a five-tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol type) hash to map traffic to available servers."
  - content: "Which configuration is required for an internal load balancer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machines should be in the same virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The virtual machines that use a load balancer to distribute a load to must be in the same virtual network."
    - content: "Virtual machines must be publicly accessible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machines that are behind an internal load balancer shouldn't be accessed publicly. The load balancer provides the access point."
    - content: "Virtual machines must be in an availability set."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this configuration is an option, it's not a requirement."
