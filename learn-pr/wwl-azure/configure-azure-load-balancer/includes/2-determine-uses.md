The Azure Load Balancer delivers high availability and network performance to your applications. The load balancer distributes inbound traffic to backend resources using load-balancing rules and health probes.

 -  Load-balancing rules determine how traffic is distributed to the backend.
 -  Health probes ensure the resources in the backend are healthy.

The Load Balancer can be used for inbound and outbound scenarios and scales up to millions of TCP and UDP application flows.
