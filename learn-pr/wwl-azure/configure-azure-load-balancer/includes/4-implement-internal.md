An internal load balancer directs traffic to resources that are inside a virtual network or that use a VPN to access Azure infrastructure. Frontend IP addresses and virtual networks are never directly exposed to an internet endpoint. Internal line-of-business applications run in Azure and are accessed from within Azure or from on-premises resources. For example, an internal load balancer could receive database requests that need to be distributed to backend SQL servers.

An internal load balancer enables the following types of load balancing:

 -  **Within a virtual network**. Load balancing from VMs in the virtual network to a set of VMs that reside within the same virtual network.
 -  **For a cross-premises virtual network**. Load balancing from on-premises computers to a set of VMs that reside within the same virtual network.
 -  **For multi-tier applications**. Load balancing for internet-facing multi-tier applications where the backend tiers are not internet-facing. The backend tiers require traffic load-balancing from the internet-facing tier.
 -  **For line-of-business applications**. Load balancing for line-of-business applications that are hosted in Azure without additional load balancer hardware or software. This scenario includes on-premises servers that are in the set of computers whose traffic is load-balanced.

> [!NOTE]
> A public load balancer could be placed in front of the internal load balancer to create a multi-tier application.
