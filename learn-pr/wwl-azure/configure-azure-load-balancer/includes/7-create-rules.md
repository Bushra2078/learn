A load balancer rule defines how traffic is distributed to the backend pool. The rule maps a given frontend IP and port combination to a set of backend IP addresses and port combination. Before configuring the rule, create the frontend, backend, and health probe. This diagram shows a rule that routes frontend TCP connections to a set of backend web (port 80) servers. The rule uses a health probe that checks on HTTP port 80.

Load balancing rules can be used in combination with NAT rules. For example, you could use NAT from the load balancerâ€™s public address to TCP 3389 on a specific virtual machine. This allows remote desktop access from outside of Azure.

By default, Azure Load Balancer distributes network traffic equally among multiple VM instances. The load balancer uses a five-tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol type) hash to map traffic to available servers. It provides stickiness only within a transport session.

Session persistence specifies how traffic from a client should be handled. The default behavior (None) is that successive requests from a client may be handled by any virtual machine. You can change this behavior.

 -  **None (default)** specifies any virtual machine can handle the request.
 -  **Client IP** specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address will be handled by the same virtual machine.
 -  **Client IP and protocol** specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same virtual machine.
