A load balancer rule defines how traffic is distributed to the backend pool. The rule maps a given frontend IP and port combination to a set of backend IP addresses and port combination. Before configuring the rule, create the frontend, backend, and health probe. This diagram shows a rule that routes frontend TCP connections to a set of backend web (port 80) servers. The rule uses a health probe that checks on HTTP port 80.

Load balancing rules can be used in combination with NAT rules. For example, you could use NAT from the load balancerâ€™s public address to TCP 3389 on a specific virtual machine. This allows remote desktop access from outside of Azure.
