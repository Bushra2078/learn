A health probe allows the load balancer to monitor the status of your app. The health probe dynamically adds or removes VMs from the load balancer rotation based on their response to health checks. When a probe fails to respond, the load balancer stops sending new connections to the unhealthy instances.

â€ŽThere are two main ways to configure health probes **HTTP** and **TCP**.

**HTTP custom probe**. The load balancer regularly probes your endpoint (every 15 seconds, by default). The instance is healthy if it responds with an HTTP 200 within the timeout period (default of 31 seconds). Any status other than HTTP 200 causes the probe to fail. You can specify the port (Port), the URI for requesting the health status from the backend (URI), amount of time between probe attempts (Interval), and the number of failures that must occur for the instance to be considered unhealthy (Unhealthy threshold).

**TCP custom probe**. This probe relies on establishing a successful TCP session to a defined probe port. If the specified listener on the VM exists, the probe succeeds. If the connection is refused, the probe fails. You can specify the Port, Interval, and Unhealthy threshold.

> [!NOTE]
> There is also a guest agent probe. This probe uses the guest agent inside the VM. It is not recommended when HTTP or TCP custom probe configurations are possible.
