  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You have a multi-tenant Azure Stack Hub system for a CSP that is used by multiple customers. You need to configure access for a support specialist to assist in the management. You need the following: - The support specialist should be prevented from accessing customer resources. - The support specialist can monitor the status of infrastructure backups. - The support specialist can create and manage plans, offers, and quotas. Which built-in role should you assign to the support technician?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reader and Data Access"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Reader and Data Access Lets you view everything but will not let you delete or create a storage account or contained resource. It will also allow read/write access to all data contained in a storage account via access to storage account keys."
    - content: "Contributor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Contributor is user that can manage everything except access to customer resources."
    - content: "User Access Administrator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. User Access Administrator grants you permission to assign roles in all Azure subscriptions and management groups associated with this Azure AD directory."
  - content: "Which identity provider do you deploy in a disconnected scenario (without a connection to the internet) when you deploy Azure Stack Hub?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When you deploy Azure Stack Hub in a connected mode (connection to the internet), you can use either Azure Active Directory (AD) or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)."
    - content: "Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When you deploy Azure Stack Hub in a disconnected mode, without a connection to the internet, only Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is supported."
    - content: "Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Active Directory stores information about objects on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use."
