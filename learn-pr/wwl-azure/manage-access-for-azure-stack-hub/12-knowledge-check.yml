  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An Azure Stack Hub operator has a multi-tenant Azure Stack Hub system used by multiple customers. They need to configure access for a support specialist to assist in the management. The support specialist should be prevented from accessing customer resources. Also, the support specialist should be able to monitor the status of infrastructure backups. Which built-in role should be assigned to the support specialist?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reader and Data Access"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Contributor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Contributor is a user that can manage everything except access to customer resources."
    - content: "User Access Administrator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. User Access Administrator grants permission to assign roles in all Azure subscriptions and management groups associated with the Azure Active Directory."
  - content: "Which identity provider is used in a disconnected mode while deploying Azure Stack Hub?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When deploying Azure Stack Hub in a connected mode either Azure Active Directory (AD) or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is used."
    - content: "Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When deploying Azure Stack Hub in a disconnected mode, only Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is supported."
    - content: "Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Active Directory stores information about objects on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find."
