Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (**SIEM**) and security orchestration automated response (**SOAR**) solution. Microsoft Sentineldelivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

### Value of a security information and event management tool

Security Operations (SecOps) teams are inundated with a high volume of alerts and spend far too much time in tasks like infrastructure set up and maintenance. As a result, many legitimate threats go unnoticed. According to the **“Cybersecurity Jobs Report 2018-2021” by Cybersecurity Ventures**, An expected shortfall of 3.5M security professionals by 2021 will further increase the challenges for security operations teams. Alert fatigue is real. Security analysts face a huge burden of triage as they not only have to sift through a sea of alerts, but also correlate alerts from different products manually or using a traditional correlation engine.

### Microsoft Azure Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel offers nearly limitless cloud scale and speed to address your security needs. Think of Microsoft Sentinel as the first **SIEM-as-a-service** that brings the power of the cloud and artificial intelligence to help security operations teams efficiently identify and stop cyber-attacks before they cause harm. Microsoft Sentinelenriches your investigation and detection by providing both Microsoft's threat intelligence stream as well as external threat intelligence streams.

Microsoft Sentinelintegrates with Microsoft 365 solution and correlates millions of signals from different products such as Azure Identity Protection, Microsoft Cloud App Security, and soon Azure Advanced Threat Protection, Windows Advanced Threat Protection, O365 Advanced Threat Protection, Intune, and Azure Information Protection. It enables the following services:

 -  **Collect data at cloud scale** across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and in multiple clouds.
 -  **Detect previously undetected threats**, and minimize false positives using Microsoft's analytics and unparalleled threat intelligence.
 -  **Investigate threats with artificial intelligence**, and hunt for suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cyber security work at Microsoft.
 -  **Respond to incidents rapidly** with built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks.
