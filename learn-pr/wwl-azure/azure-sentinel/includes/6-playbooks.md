## Automate and orchestrate common tasks by using playbooks

Automate your common tasks and simplify security orchestration with playbooks that integrate with Azure services and your existing tools.

Microsoft Sentinel's automation and orchestration solution provides a highly extensible architecture that enables scalable automation as new technologies and threats emerge. To build playbooks with Azure Logic Apps, you can choose from a growing gallery of built-in playbooks. These include 200 or more connectors for services such as Azure functions. The connectors allow you to apply any custom logic in code like:<br>

 -  ServiceNow<br>
 -  Jira
 -  Zendesk
 -  HTTP requests
 -  Microsoft Teams
 -  Slack
 -  Microsoft Entra ID
 -  Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
 -  Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

**For example**, if you use the ServiceNow ticketing system, use Azure Logic Apps to automate your workflows and open a ticket in ServiceNow each time a particular alert or incident is generated.

Playbooks are intended for **Security operations center (SOC)** engineers and analysts of all tiers to **automate** and **simplify tasks**, **including data ingestion**, **enrichment**, **investigation**, and **remediation**.

Playbooks work best with single, repeatable tasks and don't require coding knowledge. Playbooks aren't suitable for ad-hoc or complex task chains or for documenting and sharing evidence.<br>
