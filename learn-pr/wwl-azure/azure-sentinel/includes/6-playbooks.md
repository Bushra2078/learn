**Security automation and orchestration** lets you automate your common tasks and simplify security orchestration with playbooks that integrate with Azure services as well as your existing tools. Built on the foundation of Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Sentinel's automation and orchestration solution provides a highly-extensible architecture that enables scalable automation as new technologies and threats emerge. To build playbooks with Azure Logic Apps, you can choose from a growing gallery of built-in playbooks. These include 200+ connectors for services such as Azure functions. The connectors allow you to apply any custom logic in code, ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk, HTTP requests, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Windows Defender ATP, and Defender for Cloud Apps.

For example, if you use the ServiceNow ticketing system, you can use the tools provided to use Azure Logic Apps to automate your workflows and open a ticket in ServiceNow each time a particular event is detected.
