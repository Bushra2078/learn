Alerts triggered in Microsoft security solutions that are connected to Azure Sentinel, such as Microsoft Cloud App Security and Azure Advanced Threat Protection, do not automatically create incidents in Azure Sentinel. By default, when you connect a Microsoft solution to Azure Sentinel, any alert generated in that service will be stored as raw data in Azure Sentinel, in the Security Alert table in your Azure Sentinel workspace. You can then use that data like any other raw data you connect into Sentinel

### Using Microsoft Security incident creation analytic rules
Use the built-in rules available in Azure Sentinel to choose which connected Microsoft security solutions should create Azure Sentinel incidents automatically in real time. You can also edit the rules to define more specific options for filtering which of the alerts generated by the Microsoft security solution should create incidents in Azure Sentinel. 
For example, you can choose to create Azure Sentinel incidents automatically only from high-severity Azure Security Center alerts.

You can create more than one Microsoft Security analytic rule per Microsoft security service type. This does not create duplicate incidents, since each rule is used as a filter. Even if an alert matches more than one Microsoft Security analytic rule, it creates just one Azure Sentinel incident.

When you connect a Microsoft security solution, you can select whether you want the alerts from the security solution to automatically generate incidents in Azure Sentinel automatically.
