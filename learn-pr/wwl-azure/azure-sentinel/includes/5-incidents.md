Alerts triggered in Microsoft security solutions that are connected to Azure Sentinel, such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud Appsand Azure Advanced Threat Protection, do not automatically create incidents in Azure Sentinel. By default, when you connect a Microsoft solution to Azure Sentinel, any alert generated in that service will be stored as raw data in Azure Sentinel, in the Security Alert table in your Microsoft Sentinelworkspace. You can then use that data like any other raw data you connect into Sentinel

### Using Microsoft Security incident creation analytic rules

Use the built-in rules available in Microsoft Sentinelto choose which connected Microsoft security solutions should create Microsoft Sentinelincidents automatically in real time. You can also edit the rules to define more specific options for filtering which of the alerts generated by the Microsoft security solution should create incidents in Azure Sentinel. For example, you can choose to create Microsoft Sentinelincidents automatically only from high-severity Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts.

You can create more than one Microsoft Security analytic rule per Microsoft security service type. This does not create duplicate incidents, since each rule is used as a filter. Even if an alert matches more than one Microsoft Security analytic rule, it creates just one Microsoft Sentinelincident.

When you connect a Microsoft security solution, you can select whether you want the alerts from the security solution to automatically generate incidents in Microsoft Sentinelautomatically.
