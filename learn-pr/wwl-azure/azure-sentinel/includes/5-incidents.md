## Correlate alerts into incidents by using analytics rules

To help you reduce noise and minimize the number of alerts you have to review and investigate, Microsoft Sentinel uses analytics to correlate alerts into incidents. Incidents are groups of related alerts that indicate an actionable possible threat you can investigate and resolve. Use the built-in correlation rules as-is or as a starting point to build your own. Microsoft Sentinel also provides machine learning rules to map your network behavior and then look for anomalies across your resources. These analytics connect the dots by combining low-fidelity alerts about different entities with potential high-fidelity security incidents.
