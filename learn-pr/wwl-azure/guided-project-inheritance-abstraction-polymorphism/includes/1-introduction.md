Code reuse and optimization is one of the main benefits of an object-oriented programming language. Through inheritance, one of the four tenets of object-oriented programming, you will understand why.

Suppose you want to create another instance of the LangotnsAnts application. You could do it by creating duplicate code, one for each instance you want to create. To do so, you would be required to maintain the two sets of code seperately. Or, thankfully, you can do it through inheritance and code reuse.

In this module you are being asked to repurpose your code, such that it better supports reuse. Much like functions are stand-alone pieces of code that can be resused for different purposes, depending on the situation, so too can classes. We will use inheritance to create a class called `GeneralizedAnt` to demostrate the concept.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll practice how to:

- How to use inheritance.
- Understand the benefits of code reuse.

## Prerequisites

- Installation of Visual Studio Code that's configured for C# application development, including C# Dev Kit.
- Experience with the VS Code editor.
- Ability to develop C# console applications that implement business logic using loops, if statements, properties, and methods.
- Experience with basic C# syntax rules.
