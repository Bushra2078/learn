In this guided project, you are were asked to repurpose your code, such that it better supports reuse. Much like functions are stand-alone pieces of code that can be resused for different purposes.

You should now be able to do the following:

- Use inheritance.
- Understand the benefits of code reuse.

By using inheritance for code reuse you got a sample of how this powerful technique can be used to write "cleaner" code, leveraging another class in the creation of a new one.
