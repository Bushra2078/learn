You'll see both public and private container registries are available.

## Public

Common public container registries are:

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

[Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers)

Microsoft Container Registry

While Microsoft Container Registry offers a public registry, you can also create your private registries using it.

## Private

Azure Container Registry is a managed, private Docker registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0.

You can use Azure container registries to store and manage your private Docker container images and related artifacts.

Azure container registries can be used with your existing container development and deployment pipelines.
