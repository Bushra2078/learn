Containers are the third computing model, after bare metal and virtual machines â€“ and containers are here to stay.

Docker gives you a simple platform for running apps in containers, old and new apps on Windows and Linux, and that simplicity is a powerful enabler for all aspects of modern IT.

Containers aren't only faster and easier to use than VMs; they also make far more efficient use of computing hardware.

As most modern software developers attest, containers have provided engineering teams with dramatically more flexibility for running cloud-native applications on physical and virtual infrastructure.

Containers package up the application services and make them portable across different computing environments for dev/test and production use.

With containers, it's easy to ramp application instances to match spikes in demand quickly. And because containers draw on resources of the host OS, they're much lighter weight than virtual machines. It means containers make highly efficient use of the underlying server infrastructure.

So far, so good. But though the container runtime APIs are well suited to managing individual containers, they're woefully inadequate when it comes to managing applications that might comprise hundreds of containers spread across multiple hosts.

Containers need to be managed and connected to the outside world for scheduling, load balancing, and distribution. It's where a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes comes into its own.

An open-source system for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications, Kubernetes handles the work of scheduling containers onto a compute cluster and manages the workloads to ensure they run as the user intended. Instead of bolting on operations as an afterthought, Kubernetes brings software development and operations together by design. By using declarative, infrastructure-agnostic constructs to describe how applications are composed, how they interact, and how they're managed, Kubernetes enables an order-of-magnitude increase in the operability of modern software systems.

Google built Kubernetes based on its own experience running containers in production, and it indeed owes much of its success to Google's involvement. Today, its open-source, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation owns it.

Because the Kubernetes platform is open-source and has so many supporters, it's multiplying through contributions. Kubernetes marks a breakthrough for DevOps because it allows teams to keep pace with the requirements of modern software development.
