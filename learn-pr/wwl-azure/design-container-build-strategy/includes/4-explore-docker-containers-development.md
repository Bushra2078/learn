Docker is a software containerization platform with a common toolset, packaging model, and deployment mechanism, which significantly simplifies containerization and distribution of applications that can be run anywhere.

Its ubiquitous technology simplifies management by offering the same management commands against any host and creates a unique opportunity for seamless DevOps.

A Docker image can be created from a developer's desktop to a testing machine to a set of production machines that will deploy identically across any environment in seconds.

It's a massive and growing ecosystem of applications packaged in Docker containers.

DockerHub, the public containerized application registry that Docker maintains, publishes more than 180,000 applications in the general community repository.

Additionally, to guarantee that the packaging format remains universal, Docker organized the Open Container Initiative (OCI) to ensure that container packaging remains open and foundation-led.

As an example of the power of containers, a SQL Server Linux instance can be deployed using a Docker image in seconds.
