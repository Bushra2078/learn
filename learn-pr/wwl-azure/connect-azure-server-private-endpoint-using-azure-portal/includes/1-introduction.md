Connecting securely to Azure Structured Query Language (SQL) Server is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of your database. Azure offers the capability to establish a secure connection using Azure Private Endpoint, which allows you to access your Azure SQL Server securely within your virtual network. In this training module, we will explore how to connect an Azure SQL Server using an Azure Private Endpoint in the Azure portal, ensuring that your database connections are secure and isolated.

## Scenario

Imagine you work as a database administrator for a healthcare organization that stores sensitive patient data in Azure SQL Server. Your organization requires secure and private access to the SQL Server from within the virtual network to ensure compliance with industry regulations. As part of your responsibilities, you need to configure an Azure Private Endpoint for Azure SQL Server in the Azure portal.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training module, participants will:

1.  Understand the importance of using Azure Private Endpoint to establish secure connections to Azure SQL Server.
2.  Learn how to configure and create an Azure Private Endpoint for Azure SQL Server in the Azure portal.
3.  Gain insights into the network architecture and components involved in setting up an Azure Private Endpoint.
4.  Understand how to validate and test the connection between the Azure Private Endpoint and Azure SQL Server.
5.  Recognize the benefits of using Azure Private Endpoint for securing database connections and isolating network traffic.

## Goals

 -  Enable participants to configure an Azure Private Endpoint for Azure SQL Server in the Azure portal.
