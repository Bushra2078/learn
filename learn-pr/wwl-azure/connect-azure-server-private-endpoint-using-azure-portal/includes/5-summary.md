In this module, we explored the process of connecting an Azure SQL Server using an Azure Private Endpoint in the Azure portal. We learned about the significance of establishing secure and private connections to Azure SQL Server to protect sensitive data. Participants gained knowledge on configuring and creating an Azure Private Endpoint for Azure SQL Server, understanding the network architecture involved, and validating the connection. By leveraging Azure Private Endpoint, organizations can ensure secure and isolated database connections, comply with industry regulations, and safeguard sensitive data stored in Azure SQL Server.
