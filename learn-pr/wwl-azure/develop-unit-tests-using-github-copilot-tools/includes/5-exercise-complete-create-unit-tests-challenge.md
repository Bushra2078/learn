Code challenges reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before proceeding.

## Challenge: Create unit tests

In this challenge exercise, you need to create xUnit unit tests for the methods of a class.

## Prepare your coding environment

You are using the **M4BankAccount** sample application from the SampleApps folder. Open the **M4BankAccount** sample application in Visual Studio Code. Ensure that the application builds and runs successfully before you start the challenge.

The **M4BankAccount** sample app contains the following files:

- A `BankAccount` class that represents a bank account. This class has methods to get the account balance, credit or debit the account, transfer money to another account, and others. It also includes various account properties.
- A `Program` class that contains a `Main` method. The Main method creates bank accounts and simulates transactions using the `BankAccount` class.

## Challenge requirements

1. Create at least one xUnit unit test for each method in the `BankAccount` class.

1. Create a total of at least 12 unique xUnit unit tests.

1. All the tests must be visible in the Test Explorer.

1. At least one test for each method must pass when you run the tests.

## Challenge instructions

Use the following steps to complete this challenge:

1. Open the **BankAccountClass** folder in Visual Studio Code.

1. Review the project files and ensure that the solution builds and runs.

1. Create an xUnit test project named **BankAccount.UnitTests** and add it to your solution.

1. Use GitHub Copilot Chat to create the required unit tests.

1. Build the solution and ensure that the tests are displayed in the Test Explorer.

1. Run the tests and ensure that the required number of tests run successfully.
