GitHub Copilot Chat can help you write unit test cases by generating code snippets based on the code you specify. The code selections that you specify can be based on the code open in the editor or the code snippet you highlight in the editor. Using Copilot Chat can help you write test cases without spending as much time on repetitive tasks. For example, if you're writing a test case for a specific function, you can use Copilot Chat to suggest possible input parameters and expected output values based on the function's signature and body. Copilot Chat can also suggest assertions that ensure the function is working correctly, based on the code's context and semantics.

Copilot Chat can also help you write test cases for edge cases and boundary conditions that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, Copilot Chat can suggest test cases for error handling, null values, or unexpected input types, helping you ensure your code is robust and resilient. However, it is important to note that generated test cases may not cover all possible scenarios, and manual testing and code review are still necessary to ensure the quality of the code.

The C# Dev Kit extension supports the following test frameworks:

- xUnit
- NUnit
- MSTest

### Enabling a test framework

You can enable a test framework for your project with just a few steps in the Solution Explorer:

#### xUnit

Open the Command Palette and select **.NET:New Project...** then select **xUnit Test Project** and provide name and location for the new project. This command creates a new project and directory that uses xUnit as the test library and configures the test runner by adding the following `<PackageReference />` elements to the project file.

- `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`
- `xUnit`
- `xunit.runner.visualstudio`
- `coverlet.collector`

From the Terminal, you can run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    dotnet add [location of your test csproj file] reference [location of the csproj file for project to be tested]
    ```

#### NUnit

Open the Command Palette and select **.NET:New Project...** then select **NUnit3 Test Project** and provide name and location for the new project. This command creates a new project and directory that uses NUnit as the test library and configures the test runner by adding the following `<PackageReference />` elements to the project file.

- `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`
- `NUnit`
- `NUnit3TestAdapter`

From the Terminal, run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    dotnet add [location of your test csproj file] reference [location of the csproj file for project to be tested]
    ```

#### MSTest

Open the Command Palette and select **.NET:New Project...** then select **MSTest Test Project** and provide name and location for the new project. This command creates a new project and directory that uses MSTest as the test library and configures the test runner by adding the following `<PackageReference />` elements to the project file.

- `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`
- `MSTest.TestAdapter`
- `MSTest.TestFramework`
- `coverlet.collector`

From the Terminal, run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    dotnet add [location of your test csproj file] reference [location of the csproj file for project to be tested]
    ```

### Managing unit tests in Visual Studio Code

The C# Dev Kit extension also provides the following features:

- Run/Debug tests cases
- View test report

## Develop unit tests in Visual Studio Code using GitHub Copilot Chat

The combination of Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot Chat provides a powerful environment for creating and running unit tests for your C# projects.

The Unit testing process can be broken down into three stages:

- Use Visual Studio Code to create a test project for your unit tests.
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to develop unit test cases for your C# project.
- Use Visual Studio Code and the C# Dev Kit to run and manage your unit tests.

### Create a test project

To create a test project for your C# project, complete the following steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Press **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **P** to open the Command Palette.

1. Type **new project** and select **.NET: New Project...**.

1. Choose the test framework you want to use (xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest).

1. Provide a name and location for the new project.

    After creating the test project, you need to add a reference to the project that you're testing.

1. To add a reference to the project you're testing, run the following command in the Terminal:

    The command should look like this:

        ```plaintext
        dotnet add [location of your test project's .csproj file] reference [location of the project to be tested's .csproj file]
        ```

This process creates a new project and configures the test runner for the selected framework.

### Generate unit test cases using GitHub Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot Chat can be used to help you write unit test cases for your test framework. Copilot Chat identifies your test framework and coding style and generates matching code snippets. You can use Copilot Chat to complete the following tasks:

- Write unit test cases for your test framework based on the code open in the editor or the code snippet you highlight in the editor. Copilot identifies your test framework and coding style and generates matching code snippets.

- Identify and write test cases for edge cases and boundary conditions that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, Copilot can suggest test cases for error handling, null values, or unexpected input types.

- Suggest assertions that ensure the function is working correctly, based on the code's context and semantics. For example, generate assertions to ensure that function input parameters are valid.

Consider the following scenarios when asking Copilot Chat to generate unit test cases:

- If a single method is visible in full in the editor, you could ask Copilot Chat to generate a unit test for the method by typing `Write a unit test for the method in the #editor`.

- If there are multiple methods visible or the intended method extends beyond what's visible in the editor, select the code you want to generate a unit test for, then ask Copilot: `#selection write a unit test for this code`.

### Run and manage unit tests in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code and the C# Dev Kit provide a rich set of features to help you run and manage unit tests for your C# projects. You can run/debug test cases, view test results, and manage test cases using the Test Explorer.

- Run/Debug test cases: C# Dev Kit generates shortcuts (the green play button) on the left side of the class and method definition. To run the target test cases, select the green play button. You can also right-click on it to see more options.

- Test Explorer: The Test Explorer is a tree view to show all the test cases in your workspace. You can select the beaker button on the left-side Activity bar of Visual Studio Code to open it. You can also run/debug your test cases and view their test results from there.

- View test results: After running/debugging the test cases, the state of the related test items is updated in both editor decorations and the Test Explorer. You can select the links in the stack trace to navigate to the source location.

- Visual Studio Code testing commands: There are testing commands (for example, Run All Tests) that can be found by searching for Test: in the Command Palette.

- Visual Studio Code testing settings: There are Visual Studio Code settings specific to testing that can be found by searching for Testing in the Settings editor.
