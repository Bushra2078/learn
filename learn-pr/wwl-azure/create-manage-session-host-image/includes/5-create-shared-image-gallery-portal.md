An Azure Compute Gallery simplifies sharing resources, like images and application packages, across your organization.

The Azure Compute Gallery lets you share custom VM images and application packages with others in your organization, within or across regions, within a tenant. Choose what you want to share, which regions you want to make them available in, and who you want to share them with. You can create multiple galleries so that you can logically group resources.

The gallery is a top-level resource that can be shared in multiple ways:

## Create a direct shared gallery

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Compute Gallery – direct shared gallery is currently in PREVIEW and subject to the [Preview Terms for Azure Compute Gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

During the preview, you need to create a new gallery, with the property sharingProfile.permissions set to Groups. When using the CLI to create a gallery, use the --permissions groups parameter. You can't use an existing gallery, the property can't currently be updated.

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.  Type **Azure Compute Gallery** in the search box and select **Azure Compute Gallery** in the results.
3.  In the **Azure Compute Gallery** page, click **Add**.
4.  On the **Create Azure Compute Gallery** page, select the correct subscription.
5.  Complete all of the details on the page.
6.  At the bottom of the page, select **Next: Sharing method**.

## Create a community gallery

A [community gallery](/azure/virtual-machines/azure-compute-gallery#community) is shared publicly with everyone. To create a community gallery, you create the gallery first, then enable it for sharing. The name of public instance of your gallery will be the prefix you provide, plus a unique GUID.

During the preview, make sure that you create your gallery, image definitions, and image versions in the same region in order to share your gallery publicly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Compute Gallery – community galleries is currently in PREVIEW and subject to the [Preview Terms for Azure Compute Gallery - community gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

When creating an image to share with the community, you'll need to provide contact information. This information will be shown **publicly**, so be careful when providing:

 -  Community gallery prefix
 -  Publisher support email
 -  Publisher URL
 -  Legal agreement URL

Information from your image definitions will also be publicly available, like what you provide for **Publisher**, **Offer**, and **SKU**.

### Considerations

The owner of a subscription, or a user or service principal assigned to the Compute Gallery Sharing Admin role at the subscription or gallery level, can enable a gallery to go public to the community.

Making a community gallery available to all Azure users is a two-step process. First you create the gallery with community sharing enabled, when you're ready to make it public, you share the gallery.

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.  Type **Azure Compute Gallery** in the search box and select **Azure Compute Gallery** in the results.
3.  In the **Azure Compute Gallery** page, click **Add**.
4.  On the **Create Azure Compute Gallery** page, select the correct subscription.
5.  In **Resource group**, select **Create new** and type *myGalleryRG* for the name.
6.  In **Name**, type *myGallery* for the name of the gallery.
7.  Leave the default for **Region**.
8.  You can type a short description of the gallery, like *My gallery for testing*.
9.  At the bottom of the page, select **Next: Sharing method**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/create-gallery-3-0d8b6d95.png":::
    
10. On the **Sharing** tab, select **RBAC + share to public community gallery**.
11. For **Community gallery prefix** type a prefix that will be appended to a GUID to create the unique name for your community gallery.
12. For **Publisher email** type a valid e-mail address that can be used to communicate with you about the gallery.
13. For **Publisher URL**, type the URL for where users can get more information about the images in your community gallery.
14. For **Legal Agreement URL**, type the URL where end users can find legal terms for the image.
15. When you're done, select **Review + create**.
16. After validation passes, select **Create**.
17. When the deployment is finished, select **Go to resource**.

To see the public name of your gallery, select **Sharing** in the left menu.
