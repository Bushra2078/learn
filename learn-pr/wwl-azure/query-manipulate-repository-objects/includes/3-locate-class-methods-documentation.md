If any method documentation exists, the documentation webpage for the repository class will include it. Remember that repository classes aren't typically well-documented, especially the classes that aren't in the **root\CIMv2** namespace.

An internet search engine provides the fastest way to find the documentation for a class. When you enter the class name into a search engine, one of the first few search results is typically the class documentation page. Generally, the documentation page includes a section named **Methods** that lists the class methods. Select any method name to display the instructions for using that method.

The documentation allows you to determine the arguments that each method requires. For example, the **Win32Shutdown** method of the **Win32_OperatingSystem** class accepts a single argument. This argument is an integer, and it tells the method to either shut down, restart, or sign out.
