In this module, you learned to use Common Information Model (CIM) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to make changes by using methods. Methods help to query and manipulate the repository information. The following are the key takeaways:

- A method is an action that you can perform on an object. 
- To discover the methods available for an object, use the **Get-Member** cmdlet.
- To review the methods available for a particular class, use the **Get-CimClass** cmdlet.
- An internet search engine provides the fastest way to find the documentation for a class.
- Direct invocation is typically used when you've loaded WMI objects into a variable. Then, you can invoke methods available for that object type by specifying the variable name, a dot (.), and then the method.
