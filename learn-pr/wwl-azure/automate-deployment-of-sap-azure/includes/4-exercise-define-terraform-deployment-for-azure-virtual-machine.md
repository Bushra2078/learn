[Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure. It codifies infrastructure in configuration files that describe the topology of cloud resources. These resources include virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking interfaces. The Terraform CLI provides a simple mechanism to deploy and version the configuration files to Azure. Understanding Terraform deployment, along with Azure Resource Manager templates and Ansible software install and configuration, will assist you in adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices like those provided in the **SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework**. The [SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework repository](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana/blob/beta/documentation/SAP_Automation_on_Azure/table_of_contents.md) contains tooling designed to enable automated deployment for SAP on Azure. 
 
## Using Terraform

To follow along in this section, you will need to sign in to the Azure CLI with an Azure subscription, and authenticate using an Azure service principal. Using the Azure Cloud Shell is recommended. The Terraform executable is integrated with Cloud Shell. 
 
## Best practice: Authenticate via Azure service principal

To sign into an Azure subscription using a service principal, you first need access to a service principal. If you already have a service principal, you can skip this part of the section.

Automated tools that deploy or use Azure services such as Terraform should always have restricted permissions. Instead of signing in to applications as a fully privileged user, Azure offers service principals. There are many options when [creating a service principal with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?). We'll use [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) to create a service principal with a Contributor role. The Contributor role (the default) has full permissions to read and write to an Azure account. 
 
### Create an Azure service principal 

Enter the following command, replacing `<subscription_id>` with the ID of the subscription account you want to use:
 
```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{SubID}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Upon successful completion, `az ad sp create-for-rbac` displays several values. The `name`, `password`, and `tenant` values are used in the next step.
> - The password can't be retrieved if lost. As such, you should store your password in a safe place. If you forget your password, you'll need to [reset the service principal credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli#6-reset-credentials).
 
### Sign in using an Azure service principal

In the following call to `az login`, replace the placeholders with the information from your service principal:
 
```azurecli
az login --service-principal -u <service_principal_name> -p "<service_principal_password>" --tenant "<service_principal_tenant>"
```
 
## Terraform configuration files

Terraform HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is designed to be readable.

![Example of Azure Resource Manager Template Syntax vs HCL Syntax.](../media/example-azure-resource-manager-template-syntax-hcl-syntax.png)

## Sample Linux VM Azure Terraform configuration file

The following code defines the Azure Terraform provider:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~>2.0"
    }
  }
}
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

The following section creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the `eastus` location:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myterraformgroup" {
    name     = "myResourceGroup"
    location = "eastus"

    tags = {
        environment = "Terraform Demo"
    }
}
```

In other sections, you reference the resource group with `azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name`.

### Create virtual network

The following code creates a virtual network named `myVnet` in the `10.0.0.0/16` address space:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "myterraformnetwork" {
    name                = "myVnet"
    address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
    location            = "eastus"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name

    tags = {
        environment = "Terraform Demo"
    }
}
```

The following section creates a subnet named `mySubnet` in the `myVnet` virtual network:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_subnet" "myterraformsubnet" {
    name                 = "mySubnet"
    resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name
    virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.myterraformnetwork.name
    address_prefixes       = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
}
```

### Create public IP address

To access resources across the Internet, create and assign a public IP address to your VM. The following code creates a public IP address named `myPublicIP`:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_public_ip" "myterraformpublicip" {
    name                         = "myPublicIP"
    location                     = "eastus"
    resource_group_name          = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name
    allocation_method            = "Dynamic"

    tags = {
        environment = "Terraform Demo"
    }
}
```

### Create Network Security Group

Network Security Groups control the flow of network traffic in and out of your VM. The following code creates a network security group named `myNetworkSecurityGroup` and defines a rule to allow SSH traffic on TCP port 22:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "myterraformnsg" {
    name                = "myNetworkSecurityGroup"
    location            = "eastus"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name

    security_rule {
        name                       = "SSH"
        priority                   = 1001
        direction                  = "Inbound"
        access                     = "Allow"
        protocol                   = "Tcp"
        source_port_range          = "*"
        destination_port_range     = "22"
        source_address_prefix      = "*"
        destination_address_prefix = "*"
    }

    tags = {
        environment = "Terraform Demo"
    }
}
```

### Create virtual network interface card

A virtual network interface card (NIC) connects your VM to a given virtual network, public IP address, and network security group. The following code in a Terraform template creates a virtual NIC named `myNIC` connected to the virtual networking resources you've created:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_network_interface" "myterraformnic" {
    name                        = "myNIC"
    location                    = "eastus"
    resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name

    ip_configuration {
        name                          = "myNicConfiguration"
        subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.myterraformsubnet.id
        private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
        public_ip_address_id          = azurerm_public_ip.myterraformpublicip.id
    }

    tags = {
        environment = "Terraform Demo"
    }
}

# Connect the security group to the network interface
resource "azurerm_network_interface_security_group_association" "example" {
    network_interface_id      = azurerm_network_interface.myterraformnic.id
    network_security_group_id = azurerm_network_security_group.myterraformnsg.id
}
```

## Create storage account for diagnostics

To store boot diagnostics for a VM, you need a storage account. These boot diagnostics can help you troubleshoot problems and monitor the status of your VM. The storage account you create is only to store the boot diagnostics data. As each storage account must have a unique name, the following code generates some random text:

```hcl
resource "random_id" "randomId" {
    keepers = {
        # Generate a new ID only when a new resource group is defined
        resource_group = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name
    }

    byte_length = 8
}
```

Now you can create a storage account. The following section creates a storage account, with the name based on the random text generated in the preceding step:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "mystorageaccount" {
    name                        = "diag${random_id.randomId.hex}"
    resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name
    location                    = "eastus"
    account_replication_type    = "LRS"
    account_tier                = "Standard"

    tags = {
        environment = "Terraform Demo"
    }
}
```

## Create virtual machine

The final step is to create a VM and use all the resources created. The following code creates a VM named `myVM` and attaches the virtual NIC named `myNIC`. The latest `Ubuntu 18.04-LTS` image is used, and a user named `azureuser` is created with password authentication disabled.

The SSH public key file is specified in the `admin_ssh_key` block. If your SSH public key filename is different or in a different location, update the `public_key` value as needed.

```hcl
# Create (and display) an SSH key
resource "tls_private_key" "example_ssh" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits = 4096
}
output "tls_private_key" { 
    value = tls_private_key.example_ssh.private_key_pem 
    sensitive = true
}

resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "myterraformvm" {
    name                  = "myVM"
    location              = "eastus"
    resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.myterraformgroup.name
    network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.myterraformnic.id]
    size                  = "Standard_DS1_v2"

    os_disk {
        name              = "myOsDisk"
        caching           = "ReadWrite"
        storage_account_type = "Premium_LRS"
    }

    source_image_reference {
        publisher = "Canonical"
        offer     = "UbuntuServer"
        sku       = "18.04-LTS"
        version   = "latest"
    }

    computer_name  = "myvm"
    admin_username = "azureuser"
    disable_password_authentication = true

    admin_ssh_key {
        username       = "azureuser"
        public_key     = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
    }

    boot_diagnostics {
        storage_account_uri = azurerm_storage_account.mystorageaccount.primary_blob_endpoint
    }

    tags = {
        environment = "Terraform Demo"
    }
}
```
 
To see Terraform in action using the commands introduced in the next section, create a file called *terraform_azure.tf* and paste the Terraform code sections into it. Save the file in a directory with no other .tf files at or below the file path.
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SSH public key file is specified in the `admin_ssh_key` block. If your SSH public key filename is different or in a different location, update the `public_key` value accordingly.
 
## Create and apply a Terraform execution plan

In this section, you learn how to create an execution plan and apply it to your cloud infrastructure.

![Basic Terraform commands: Init, Plan, Apply, Destroy.](../media/basic-terraform-commands.png)
 
With your Terraform template created, the next steps are: 

- `terraform init` - initialize Terraform to ensure all the prerequisites to build 
- `terraform plan` - review and validate the template
- `terraform apply` - apply the plan and deploy to Azure
- `terraform plan -destroy` and `terraform apply -destroy` - remove the plan deployment from Azure
 
 
### Init: Initialize the working folder

To initialize the Terraform deployment, run [terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) from the working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This command downloads the Azure modules required to create an Azure resource group.

```cmd
    terraform init
```

### Plan: pre-flight validation

After initialization, you create an execution plan by running [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html). We choose the simple file name `terraform_plan`, any name can be used.

```cmd
    terraform plan -out terraform_plan.tfplan
```

- The `terraform plan` command creates an execution plan but doesn't execute it. Instead, it determines what actions are necessary to create the configuration specified in your configuration files. This pattern allows you to verify whether the execution plan matches your expectations before making any changes to actual resources.
- The optional `-out` parameter allows you to specify an output file for the plan. Using the `-out` parameter ensures that the plan you reviewed is exactly what is applied.
- To read more about persisting execution plans and security, see the [security warning section](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#security-warning).
 
 
### Apply: Deploy

Once you're ready to apply the execution plan to your cloud infrastructure, you run [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html).

```cmd
    terraform apply terraform_plan.tfplan
``` 
 
### Destroy: Reverse a Terraform execution plan

1. To reverse, or undo, the execution plan, you run [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) and specify the `destroy` flag as follows:

    ```cmd
    terraform plan -destroy -out terraform_plan.destroy.tfplan
    ```

2. Run [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) to apply the execution plan reversal.
    
    ```cmd
    terraform apply terraform_plan.destroy.tfplan
    ```
