  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following types of shared access signatures (SAS) applies to Blob storage only?"
    choices:
    - content: "Account SAS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An account SAS delegates access to resources in one or more of the storage services. All of the operations available via a service or user delegation SAS are also available via an account SAS."
    - content: "Service SAS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A service SAS delegates access to a resource in the following Azure Storage services: Blob storage, Queue storage, Table storage, or Azure Files."
    - content: "User delegation SAS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A user delegation SAS is secured with Azure Active Directory credentials and also by the permissions specified for the SAS. A user delegation SAS applies to Blob storage only."
  - content: "Which of the following best practices provides the most flexible and secure way to use a service or account shared access signature (SAS)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Associate SAS tokens with a stored access policy."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The most flexible and secure way to use a service or account SAS is to associate the SAS tokens with a stored access policy."
    - content: "Always use HTTPS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Using HTTPS prevents main-in-the-middle attacks but isn't the most flexible and secure practice."
    - content: "Implement a user delegation SAS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A user delegation SAS is the most secure SAS, but isn't highly flexible because you must use Azure Active Directory to manage credentials."
