This module focuses on configuring storage security in Azure. It covers topics such as configuring shared access signatures (SAS), implementing customer-managed keys, and defining stored access policies for Azure Storage encryption.

Suppose you work for a financial services company that stores sensitive customer data in Azure Storage. Recently, there is an increase in cyber attacks targeting cloud storage, and your company wants to ensure that their data is secure. Your task is to configure storage security in Azure to protect the customer data from unauthorized access. By implementing shared access signatures (SAS), customer-managed keys, and stored access policies, you can enhance the security of the Azure Storage solution and mitigate the risk of data breaches. This module guides you through the process of configuring these security measures and provide best practices for securing Azure Storage.

The goal of this module is to equip you with the knowledge and skills to configure storage security in Azure. By the end of this module, you are able to implement shared access signatures, manage customer-managed keys, and define stored access policies to enhance the security of Azure Storage.
