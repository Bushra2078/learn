In this module, you learned about configuring storage security in Azure. The topics covered include configuring shared access signatures (SAS), implementing customer-managed keys, and defining stored access policies for Azure Storage encryption. You explored different security strategies offered by Azure Storage, such as encryption, authentication, authorization, and user access control. 

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Azure Storage offers a range of security strategies, including encryption, authentication, authorization, and user access control.

- Shared access signatures (SAS) provide a secure way to grant restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources without compromising account keys.

- Azure Storage encryption automatically encrypts and decrypts data. Key management is done by Microsoft or using an Azure Key Vault for more control and flexibility.
