A shared access signature (SAS) is a uniform resource identifier (URI) URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. SAS is a secure way to share your storage resources without compromising your account keys.

You can provide a SAS to clients who shouldn't have access to your storage account key. By distributing a SAS URI to these clients, you grant them access to a resource for a specified period of time. 

### Things to know about shared access signatures

Let's review some characteristics of a SAS.

- A SAS gives you granular control over the type of access you grant to clients who have the SAS. 

- An account-level SAS can delegate access to multiple storage services, such as blobs, files, queues, and tables.

- You can specify the time interval for which a SAS is valid, including the start time and the expiration time.

- You specify the permissions granted by the SAS. A SAS for a blob might grant read and write permissions to that blob, but not delete permissions.

- SAS provides account-level and service-level control.

   - **Account-level** SAS delegates access to resources in one or more Azure Storage services.

   - **Service-level** SAS delegates access to a resource in only one Azure Storage service.

   > [!NOTE]
   > A **stored access policy** can provide another level of control when you use a service-level SAS on the server side. You can group SASs and provide other restrictions by using a stored access policy.

- There are optional SAS configuration settings: 

   - **IP addresses**. You can identify an IP address or range of IP addresses from which Azure Storage accepts the SAS. Configure this option to specify a range of IP addresses that belong to your organization.

   - **Protocols**. You can specify the protocol over which Azure Storage accepts the SAS. Configure this option to restrict access to clients by using HTTPS.

## Configure a shared access signature

In the Azure portal, you configure several settings to create a SAS. As you review these details, consider how you might implement shared access signatures in your storage security solution.

- **Signing method**: Choose the signing method: Account key or User delegation key.
- **Signing key**: Select the signing key from your list of keys.
- **Permissions**: Select the permissions granted by the SAS, such as read or write.
- **Start and Expiry date/time**: Specify the time interval for which the SAS is valid. Set the start time and the expiry time.
- **Allowed IP addresses**: (Optional) Identify an IP address or range of IP addresses from which Azure Storage accepts the SAS. 
- **Allowed protocols**: (Optional) Select the protocol over which Azure Storage accepts the SAS.
