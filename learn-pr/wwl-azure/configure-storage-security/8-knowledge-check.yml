  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A company uses an Azure storage account for storing large numbers of video and audio files. Containers store each type of file and access should be limited to those files. Additionally, the files can only be accessed through shared access signatures. The company wants to be able to revoke access to the files and to change the period for which users can access the files. What should you do to accomplish this in the most simple and effective way?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an SAS for each user and delete the SAS when you want to prevent access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Creating a SAS for each user would involve a great amount of administrative overhead. Can you think of another alternative?"
    - content: "Implement stored access policies for each container to enable revocation of access or change of duration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. SAS will let you change access based on permissions or duration by replacing the policy with a new one or deleting it altogether to revoke access."
    - content: "Periodically regenerate the account key to control access to the files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Regenerating keys would prevent all users from accessing all files at the same time."
  - content: "When configuring network access to your Azure Storage Account, what is the default network rule?"
    choices:
    - content: "To allow all connections from all networks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The default network rule is to allow all connections from all networks."
    - content: "To allow all connection from a private IP address range."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. By default the IP address is not considered."
    - content: "To deny all connections from all networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. All connections are not, by default, denied."
  - content: "The company is planning a delegation model for the Azure storage. Apps in the production environment must have unrestricted access to storage resources. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use shared access signatures for the production apps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Shared access signatures is not the best solution for the production app."
    - content: "Use access keys for the production apps."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Access keys provide unrestricted access to the storage resources, which is the requirement for production apps in this scenario."
    - content: "Use Stored Access Policies for the production apps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Stored Access Policies are not the best solution for the production app."
