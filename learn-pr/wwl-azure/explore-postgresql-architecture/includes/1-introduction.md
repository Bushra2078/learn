PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database that runs on macOS, Linux, Unix, and Windows. PostgreSQL was built and is currently maintained by a [worldwide team of volunteers](https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/). The source code is freely available, and PostgreSQL isn't owned or controlled by any one commercial organization.
