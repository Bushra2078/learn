Platform engineering is a practice that aims to enhance the developer experience by improving security, compliance, costs, and time-to-business value through self-service and a secure, governed framework. The development team in the software development company scenario will highly benefit from this mindset shift towards a product-based approach to deliver value to the company. 

Platform engineering focuses on providing developers with the necessary tools and resources to streamline their development process. By implementing self-service capabilities, developers can access the required infrastructure, services, and environments without relying on external teams or waiting for manual provisioning. This empowers developers to work more efficiently and reduces the time spent on non-development tasks.

Furthermore, platform engineering emphasizes the importance of developer experiences. It aims to create a seamless and intuitive environment for developers to write code, collaborate, and deploy their applications. By providing a user-friendly interface and automating repetitive tasks, developers can focus more on coding and delivering value to the business.

Improving developer experience with platform engineering also involves ensuring security and compliance. By implementing a secure and governed framework, developers can adhere to best practices and regulatory requirements without hindering their productivity. This includes features such as access controls, monitoring, and auditing to maintain a secure development environment.

Platform engineering aims to enhance the developer experience by providing self-service capabilities, a user-friendly environment, and ensuring security and compliance. By adopting this practice, development teams can improve their efficiency, reduce time-to-market, and deliver high-quality software.
