In this module, you have learned about cloud-native applications and their benefits. Cloud-native applications are built from the ground up and are optimized for cloud scale and performance. They’re based on microservices architectures, use managed services, and take advantage of continuous delivery to achieve reliability and faster time to market. Cloud-native systems take full advantage of the cloud service model and embrace the Cattle service model. The Azure cloud platform supports this type of highly elastic infrastructure with automatic scaling, self-healing, and monitoring capabilities. Cloud-native applications offer many advantages, including resilience, elasticity, observability, automation, portability, security, composability, and cost-effectiveness.

The main takeaways from this module are that cloud-native applications are designed to take advantage of cloud computing models to increase speed, flexibility, and quality, while reducing deployment risks. They offer many benefits, including being resilient, elastic, observable, automated, portable, secure, composable, modern, open, managed, cost-effective, sustainable, inclusive, collaborative, data-driven, agile, and innovative. There are many options for teams to build and deploy cloud-native and containerized applications on Azure, including Azure Container Apps, Azure App Service, Azure Container Instances, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Functions, Azure Spring Apps, and Azure Red Hat OpenShift.
