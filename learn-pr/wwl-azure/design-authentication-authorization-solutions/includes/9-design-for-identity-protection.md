[Identity Protection](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection) is a tool that allows organizations to accomplish three key tasks:

- [Automate the detection and remediation of identity-based risks](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies).

- [Investigate risks](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk) using data in the portal.

- [Export risk detection data to other tools.](/azure/sentinel/connect-azure-ad-identity-protection)

The signals generated by and fed to Identity Protection, can be exported to other tools. For example, Conditional Access can make decisions based on your organization’s policies. You could feed information to a security information and event management (SIEM) tool for further investigation. 

Here’s an example where a user attempts to sign in to Azure Active Directory. Azure AD calculates real-time sign in risk based on sign in properties. Identity protection then aggregates the user’s risk. If the risk level meets the Identity Protection policy threshold the user may be blocked or challenged by MFA. If the user risk level is acceptable, they’re granted access.

### Risk policies

Risk policy detections in Azure AD Identity Protection include any identified suspicious actions related to user accounts in the directory. There are two risk policies that are evaluated: user risk and sign in risk.

### User risk policies

A [user risk](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks) represents the probability that a given identity or account is compromised. For example, the user's valid credentials have been leaked. These risks are calculated offline using Microsoft's internal and external threat intelligence sources. Here are some user risks that can be identified.

- **Leaked credentials.** Microsoft checks for leaked credentials from the dark web, paste sites, or other sources. These leaked credentials are checked against Azure AD users' current valid credentials for valid matches.

- **Azure AD threat intelligence.** This risk detection type indicates user activity that is unusual for the given user or is consistent with known attack patterns.

> [!TIP]
> Microsoft's recommendation is to set the user risk policy threshold to **High.**

**Sign-in risk policies**

A [sign-in risk](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks) represents the probability that a given sign-in (authentication request) isn't authorized by the identity owner. Sign-in risk can be calculated in real-time or calculated offline. Here are some sign-in risks that can be identified.

- **Anonymous IP address**. This risk detection type indicates sign-ins from an anonymous IP address. For example, a Tor browser or anonymized VPNs.

- **Atypical travel**. This risk detection type identifies two sign-ins originating from geographically distant location. Given past behavior, at least one of the locations may also be atypical for the user.

- **Malware linked IP address**. This risk detection type indicates sign-ins from IP addresses infected with malware. This malware is known to actively communicate with a bot server.

- **Password spray**. This risk detection is triggered when a password spray attack has been performed. Password spray is one of the most popular attacks. Bad actors try to defeat lockout and detection by trying many users against one password.

 

> [!TIP]
> Microsoft's recommendation is to set the sign-in risk policy to **Medium and above** and allow self-remediation options. Self-remediation options, like password change and multifactor authentication, will have less impact than blocking users.
