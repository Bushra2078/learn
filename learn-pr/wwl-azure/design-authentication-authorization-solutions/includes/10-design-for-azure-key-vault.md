Direct storage and handling of secrets, encryption keys, and certificates is risky. Every usage introduces the possibility of unintentional data exposure. Azure Key Vault provides a secure storage area so you can manage all your app secrets and properly encrypt your data in transit or while it's being stored. 

Azure Key Vault can help you solve security problems for Tailwind Traders:

- **Manage secrets**. You can securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.

- **Manage keys**. Key Vault is a key management solution that lets you easily create and control encryption keys to encrypt corporate data.

- **Manage certificates**. Key Vault is also a service that makes it easy to enroll, manage, and deploy public and private Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) certificates for use with Azure and internal connected resources.

### Things to know about Azure Key Vault

- Key Vault is available in two service tiers:
   - **Standard tier** lets you encrypt your data with a software key.
   - **Premium tier** offers hardware security module (HSM)-protected keys.

- You can build access policies with restricted secret access that are tailored to the apps and individuals that need them.

- Sensitive app information can be separated from other configuration and code, which reduces the risk of accidental leaks.

- Centralized secret storage allows required changes to happen in only one place.

- Logging and monitoring in Key Vault helps you understand how and when secrets are accessed.

- Key Vault provides secure access to sensitive information from within your apps:
   - Keys, secrets, and certificates are protected without writing extra code, and you can use these assets from your apps.
   - Customers can own and manage their own keys, secrets, and certificates. Your apps don't own the responsibility or potential liability for customer assets. You can concentrate on providing the core software features for Tailwind Traders apps. 
   - Your app can use keys for signing and encryption while keeping key management external from the app. 
   - You can manage credentials like passwords, access keys, and shared access signature tokens by storing them in Key Vault as secrets. 

### Things to consider when using Azure Key Vault

- **Consider shared access signatures for clients**. Implement shared access signatures to provide secure delegated access to resources in your Tailwind Traders storage account. With Key Vault shared access signatures, you have granular control over how clients can access your data:
   - Determine which resources the client can access.
   - Define the client's permissions for those resources.
   - Specify how long the client's shared access signature is valid. 

- **Consider clients who don't have permissions to your resources**. Use shared access signatures to give secure access to resources in your storage account to any Tailwind Traders client who doesn't otherwise have permissions to those resources.

- **Consider user read and write access to your storage account**. Enable users to read and write their own data to your Tailwind Traders storage account by using shared access signatures in Key Vault. In a scenario where a storage account stores user data, there are two typical design patterns:

   - Clients upload and download data via a front-end proxy service that performs authentication. The front-end proxy service allows the validation of business rules. For large amounts of data, or high-volume transactions, creating a service that can scale to match demand might be expensive or difficult.

   - A lightweight service authenticates the client as needed and then generates a shared access signature. After the client app receives the signature, the client can access storage account resources directly. Access permissions are defined by the signature and for the interval allowed by the signature. The signature mitigates the need to route all data through the front-end proxy service.

- **Consider a hybrid approach**. Many real-world services can benefit from a hybrid approach for secure access. Some data might be processed and validated via the front-end proxy. Other data might be saved and read directly by using shared access signatures. Review your options to see if a hybrid approach is the best fit for Tailwind Traders.
