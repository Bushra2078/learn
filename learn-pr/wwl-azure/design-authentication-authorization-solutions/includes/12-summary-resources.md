In this module, youâ€™ve learned how to design with authentication and authorization in mind. You have learned different strategies for implementing identities and access for applications. You should now be able to:

- Design for identity and access management.

- Design for Azure AD B2B.

- Design for Azure AD B2C.

- Design for role-based access control.

- Design for conditional access.

- Design for identity protection.

- Design for access reviews.

- Design for service principals for applications.

- Design for Azure Key Vault.
