  questions:
  - content: "How can Tailwind Traders ensure that employees at the company's retail stores can access company applications only from approved tablet devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "Single sign-on"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SSO helps a user to remember only one ID and one password for multiple applications. SSO doesn't verify the device that's trying to access an application."
    - content: "Conditional access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Conditional Access enables you to require users to access your applications only from approved, or managed, devices."
    - content: "Multi-factor authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multi-factor authentication provides additional security for your identities. MFA doesn't verify the device that's trying to access the resource or application."
  - content: "What should Tailwind Traders do to ensure employees have the correct permissions for their job role?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a conditional access policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conditional access policies won't validate employee job role access."
    - content: "Review each user's role-based access control permissions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this might work, it would be a long and tedious process. Also, IT personnel aren't in the best position to determine if an employee's access is correct."
    - content: "Require an access review."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An access review would give managers an opportunity to validate the employee's access."
  - content: "What should Tailwind Traders do to give access to the partner developers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use AD Connect to bring in the developer accounts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AD Connect is used to bring in on-premises accounts."
    - content: "Ask the developers to sign in with a social identification. For example, Google, LinkedIn, or Facebook account."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. External social accounts are used for business-to-customer applications."
    - content: "Invite the developers as guest users to their directory."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In business-to-business scenarios guest user accounts are created. You can then apply the appropriate permissions."
  - content: "What solution would be best for the user sign-in attempts requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a user risk policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A user risk policy represents the probability that a given identity or account is compromised. For example, the user's valid credentials have been leaked."
    - content: "Create a sign-in risk policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A sign-in risk policy can identify anonymous IP and atypical locations. Secondary multi-factor authentication can then be required."
    - content: "Require an access review."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An access review provides an opportunity to validate an employee's continued access to assets."
