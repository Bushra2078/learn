The [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/) says its mission is to support people who explore and apply agile values and principles. Also, practices to make building software solutions more effective, humane, and sustainable.

They have published a [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/).

And from the publication, they have distilled the [12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/).

 -  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
 -  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
 -  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of months to a couple of weeks, with a preference for a shorter timescale.
 -  Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
 -  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
 -  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
 -  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
 -  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
 -  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
 -  Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
 -  The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
 -  The team regularly reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
