  - content: "What purpose does the **outputs** section of an ARM template serve?"
    choices:
    - content: "Specify the resources to deploy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The \"resources\" section of the file specifies which resources to deploy."
    - content: "Return values from the deployed resources"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The \"outputs\" section returns values from the resource(s) that were deployed."
    - content: "Define values that are reused in your templates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The \"variables\" section of the file is used to define values."
  - content: "Which ARM template deployment mode deletes resources in a resource group that aren't specified in the template?"
    choices:
    - content: "Incremental"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The incremental mode only adds resources specified in an ARM template deployment."
    - content: "Complete"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Complete mode will delete resources not specified in an ARM template deployment."
    - content: "Both incremental and complete delete resources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Only the complete mode deletes resources not specified in an ARM template deployment."
