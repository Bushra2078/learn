Sometimes you need to optionally deploy a resource in an Azure Resource Manager template (Azure Resource Manager template). Use the `condition` element to specify whether the resource is deployed. The value for the condition resolves to true or false. When the value is true, the resource is created. When the value is false, the resource isn't created. The value can only be applied to the whole resource.

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional deployment doesn't cascade to [**child resources**](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/child-resource-name-type). If you want to conditionally deploy a resource and its child resources, you must apply the same condition to each resource type.

## New or existing resource

You can use conditional deployment to create a new resource or use an existing one. The following example shows how to use condition to deploy a new storage account or use an existing storage account. It contains a parameter named `newOrExisting` which is used as a condition in the `resources` section.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "storageAccountName": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]"
    },
    "newOrExisting": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "new",
      "allowedValues": [
        "new",
        "existing"
      ]
    }
  },
  "functions": [],
  "resources": [
    {
      "condition": "[equals(parameters('newOrExisting'), 'new')]",
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "apiVersion": "2019-06-01",
      "name": "[parameters('storageAccountName')]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "sku": {
        "name": "Standard_LRS",
        "tier": "Standard"
      },
      "kind": "StorageV2",
      "properties": {
        "accessTier": "Hot"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

When the parameter **newOrExisting** is set to **new**, the condition evaluates to true. The storage account is deployed. However, when **newOrExisting** is set to **existing**, the condition evaluates to false and the storage account isn't deployed.

## Runtime functions

If you use a `reference` or `list` function with a resource that is conditionally deployed, the function is evaluated even if the resource isn't deployed. You get an error if the function refers to a resource that doesn't exist.

Use the `if` function to make sure the function is only evaluated for conditions when the resource is deployed. 

You set a resource as dependent on a conditional resource exactly as you would any other resource. When a conditional resource isn't deployed, Azure Resource Manager automatically removes it from the required dependencies.
