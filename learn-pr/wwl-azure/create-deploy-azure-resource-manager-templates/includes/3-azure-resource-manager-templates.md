With Resource Manager, you can create a template (in JSON format) that defines the infrastructure and configuration of your Azure solution. By using a template, you can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout its lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.

When you deploy a template, Resource Manager converts the template into REST API operations. For example, when Resource Manager receives a template with the following resource definition:

```json
"resources": [
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
    "apiVersion": "2019-04-01",
    "name": "mystorageaccount",
    "location": "westus",
    "sku": {
      "name": "Standard_LRS"
    },
    "kind": "StorageV2",
    "properties": {}
  }
]
```

It converts the definition to the following REST API operation, which is sent to the `Microsoft.Storage` resource provider:

```http
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount?api-version=2019-04-01
REQUEST BODY
{
  "location": "westus",
  "sku": {
    "name": "Standard_LRS"
  },
  "kind": "StorageV2",
  "properties": {}
}
```

Notice that the **apiVersion** you set in the template for the resource is used as the API version for the REST operation. You can repeatedly deploy the template and have confidence it will continue to work. By using the same API version, you don't have to worry about breaking changes that might be introduced in later versions.

You can deploy a template using any of the following options:

* Azure portal
* Azure CLI
* PowerShell
* REST API
* Button in GitHub repository
* Azure Cloud Shell


## Defining multi-tiered templates

How you define templates and resource groups is entirely up to you and how you want to manage your solution. For example, you can deploy a three tier application through a single template to a single resource group.

:::image type="content" source="../media/three-tier-template.png" alt-text="Image showing the deployment of a virtual machine, app service, and SQL DB to a resource group in a single ARM template":::

But, you don't have to define your entire infrastructure in a single template. Often, it makes sense to divide your deployment requirements into a set of targeted, purpose-specific templates. You can easily reuse these templates for different solutions. To deploy a particular solution, you create a master template that links all the required templates. The following image shows how to deploy a three tier solution through a parent template that includes three nested templates.

:::image type="content" source="../media/nested-tiers-template.png" alt-text="Image showing three templates nested in a parent template. Each of the nested templates deploys one of the components of a 3-tier solution to a single resource group":::

If you envision your tiers having separate lifecycles, you can deploy your three tiers to separate resource groups. The resources can still be linked to resources in other resource groups.

Azure Resource Manager analyzes dependencies to ensure resources are created in the correct order. If one resource relies on a value from another resource (such as a virtual machine needing a storage account for disks), you set a dependency. For more information, see Defining dependencies in Azure Resource Manager templates.

You can also use the template for updates to the infrastructure. For example, you can add a resource to your solution and add configuration rules for the resources that are already deployed. If the template specifies creating a resource but that resource already exists, Azure Resource Manager performs an update instead of creating a new asset. Azure Resource Manager updates the existing asset to the same state as it would be as new.

Resource Manager provides extensions for scenarios when you need additional operations such as installing particular software that isn't included in the setup. If you're already using a configuration management service, like DSC, Chef or Puppet, you can continue working with that service by using extensions.

Finally, the template becomes part of the source code for your app. You can check it in to your source code repository and update it as your app evolves. You can edit the template through Visual Studio.

## Share templates

After creating your template, you may wish to share it with other users in your organization. [Template specs](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-specs) enable you to store a template as a resource type. You use role-based access control to manage access to the template spec. Users with read access to the template spec can deploy it, but not change the template.

This approach means you can safely share templates that meet your organization's standards.
