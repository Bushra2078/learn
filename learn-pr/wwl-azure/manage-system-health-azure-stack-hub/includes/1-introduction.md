The health resource provider manages health and alerts in Azure. Azure Stack Hub infrastructure components register with the health resource provider during Azure Stack Hub deployment and configuration. This registration enables the display of health and alerts for each component.

In this module, you will learn how to view the health state of components in the administrator portal and through REST API and PowerShell. Also, you'll see how to use syslog to integrate Azure Stack Hub infrastructure with external security solutions already deployed in your datacenter.

This module aligns with the exam AZ-600: Configuring and Operating a Hybrid Cloud with Microsoft Azure Stack Hub.
