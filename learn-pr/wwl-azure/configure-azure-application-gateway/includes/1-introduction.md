Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer for web traffic. Administrators implement an application gateway to manage traffic to their web apps.

Suppose you work for the motor vehicle department of a governmental organization. The department runs several public websites that enable drivers to register their vehicles, and renew their licenses online. The vehicle registration website has been running on a single server, and has suffered multiple outages because of server failures. The outages have resulted in frustrated drivers trying to register their vehicles before their registrations expire.

You're responsible for improving the resiliency of the site by adding multiple web servers to distribute the load. You want to centralize the site on a single load-balancing service, and simplify the URLs for site visitors. You're researching how to implement Azure Application Gateway.
