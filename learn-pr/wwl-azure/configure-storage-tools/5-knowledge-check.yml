  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "A manufacturing company's finance department wants to control how the data is being transferred to Azure Files. They want a graphical tool to manage the process, but they don't want to use the Azure portal. What tool would be best in this situation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Box"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Data Box would be better for importing and exporting very large data sets to Azure."
    - content: "Robocopy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Robocopy would be better for copying large datasets or lots of files across volumes."
    - content: "Azure Storage Explorer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Storage Explorer is the best choice of the finance department doesn't want to use the Azure portal."
  - content: "There is an existing storage account in Azure that stores unstructured data. The organization creates a new storage account. What is the best way to move the existing data to the new storage account?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Is there another Azure tool more focused on storage?"
    - content: "Use the Robocopy command-line tool"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. It will be difficult to move data between cloud storage accounts."
    - content: "Use the AzCopy command-line tool"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The key in this scenario is to move data between storage accounts. The AzCopy tool can work with two different storage accounts. The other tools do not copy data between storage accounts. Alternatively, although not one of the answer choices, Storage Explorer can be used to copy data between storage accounts."
  - content: "The finance team needs to transfer a series of large files to blob storage. It may take several hours to upload each file. Everyone is concerned if the transfer fails, it will have to be restarted. Which tool is the most appropriate for this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Is there another tool that might more appropriate for this task?"
    - content: "AzCopy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. AzCopy is ideal for transferring large files as it can run in the background."
    - content: "Azure Storage Explorer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Is there another tool that might more appropriate for this task?"
