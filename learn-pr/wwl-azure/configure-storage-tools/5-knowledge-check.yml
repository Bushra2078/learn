    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Box"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data Box would be better for importing and exporting very large data sets to Azure."
    - content: "Robocopy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Robocopy would be better for copying large datasets or lots of files across volumes."

  - content: "There is an existing storage account in Azure that stores unstructured data. The organization creates a new storage account. What is the best way to move the existing data to the new storage account?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Is there another Azure tool more focused on storage?"
    - content: "Use the Robocopy command-line tool"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It will be difficult to move data between cloud storage accounts."
    - content: "Use the AzCopy command-line tool"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The key in this scenario is to move data between storage accounts. The AzCopy tool can work with two different storage accounts. The other tools do not copy data between storage accounts. Alternatively, although not one of the answer choices, Storage Explorer can be used to copy data between storage accounts."
