Azure Administrators are familiar with the tools available to manage Azure Storage. They can assess a data storage scenario and recommend the tool that best meets the system requirements.

In this module, you learned how to configure several Azure Storage tools, including Azure Storage Explorer, AzCopy, and the Azure Import/Export Service. You reviewed how to analyze scenarios to determine which tools solve different problems. You studied how Azure Storage Explorer can be a good option for users who prefer to not access their data through the Azure portal. You discovered how AzCopy is ideal for moving large amounts of data because the tool can run as a background process. You explored how to work with the Azure Import/Export service to securely import large amounts of data to Azure Blob Storage and Azure Files. You examined how to use the WAImportExport command-line tool with the Import/Export service to repair files corrupted during import or export.
