App Service Diagnostics generates diagnostics data that lets you troubleshoot web app down scenarios.

Suppose you work at a coffee company, called Fourth Coffee, who is launching a new pastry line for their consumers. They're expecting to release a new application called ‘Cheesecake’ that allows their consumers to explore various different flavors and types of cheesecakes. This application will also store information such as recipes, calories, consumer favorites, order history and more. This new application is hosted using Azure Services. In the beta test launch, the web app is down and is now unresponsive. To get the app back up and running in time for the application launch, you must use the Azure App Services Diagnostics to determine what the cause of the unresponsiveness is.

This module shows you App Service Diagnostics functionalities, how to troubleshoot an HTTP server error with Web App Down, identify an application crash event with Application Crashes, configure Crash Monitoring to ensure proper monitoring of application crashes, analyze the collected memory dumps and call stack information, and use Ask Genie to identify detectors for problem scenarios. 

After completing this module, you’ll know how to troubleshoot downtimes with Web App Down, mitigate application crashes with Crash Monitoring, and use Ask Genie to identify relevant diagnostics information.

## Learning objectives

- Mitigate application crashes with Crash Monitoring 

- Use Ask Genie to identify relevant diagnostics information

## Prerequisites

- Ability to navigate the Azure portal

- A basic understanding of web app performance would be helpful but isn't required
