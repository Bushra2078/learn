  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A company wants to ensure protection against accidental or malicious deletion of their secrets. What feature should they configure on their key vault?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure soft delete and purge protection features on their secrets"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Soft delete and purge protection features only protect against accidental or malicious deletion of secrets, not the entire key vault."
    - content: "Back up all secrets in the key vault"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Backing up secrets may introduce operational challenges and cause time-out errors."
    - content: "Configure soft delete and purge protection features on their key vault"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Soft delete and purge protection features protect against accidental or malicious deletion of the entire key vault."
  - content: "A company wants to ensure that only approved changes can be made to their environment to maintain compliance. Which artifact can be included in a blueprint definition to achieve this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Resource Hierarchy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Resource Hierarchy is used to create a new resource group for use by other artifacts within the blueprint."
    - content: "Azure Resource Manager template"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Resource Manager template is used to compose complex environments."
    - content: "Policy Assignment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Policy Assignment allows assignment of a policy or initiative to the subscription the blueprint is assigned to, ensuring only approved changes can be made to the environment."
  - content: "A company wants to ensure that their development teams can rapidly build and start up new environments with trust they're building within organizational compliance. Which Azure service enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Resource Manager templates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Resource Manager templates are documents that get used for deployments of one or more Azure resources, but once those resources deploy there's no active connection or relationship to the template."
    - content: "Azure Policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Policy is a default allow and explicit deny system focused on resource properties during deployment and for already existing resources."
    - content: "Azure Blueprints"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. It makes it possible for development teams to rapidly build and start up new environments with trust they're building within organizational compliance."
  - content: "A security administrator needs to ensure that cryptographic keys are regularly updated to enhance security. Which of the following Azure Key Vault configurations should be implemented to achieve this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implement backup and recovery processes for certificates, secrets, and keys"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Backup and recovery processes ensure data resilience and availability, but they do not address key rotation."
    - content: "Configure access to Key Vault using Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RBAC is used to control permissions effectively, but it does not address key rotation."
    - content: "Configure key rotation to enhance security by regularly updating cryptographic keys"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Key rotation enhances security by regularly updating cryptographic keys."
  - content: "A company needs to store cryptographic keys in a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSM. Which Azure service can they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Key Vault Managed HSM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Key Vault Managed HSM currently uses FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs."
    - content: "Azure Security Center"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers and provides advanced threat protection across hybrid workloads."
    - content: "Azure Dedicated HSM"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Dedicated HSM is an Azure service that provides cryptographic key storage in Azure and meets the most stringent security requirements, including FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validation."
