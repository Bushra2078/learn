  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of including policies in a blueprint definition?"
    choices:
    - content: "To increase the flexibility of assigning values to blueprint parameters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Blueprint parameters are used to pass values to policies or Azure Resource Manager templates, not policies themselves."
    - content: "To limit the number of artifacts in a blueprint definition"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Policies are included to ensure compliance and restrict unauthorized changes."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Including policies in a blueprint definition ensures that only approved or expected changes can be made to the environment, maintaining compliance and stability."
  - content: "What is the purpose of automated cryptographic key rotation in Key Vault?"
    choices:
    - content: "To decrease the frequency of key version generation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Automated cryptographic key rotation is not intended to decrease the frequency of key version generation."
    - content: "To increase the cost of scheduled key rotation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Automated cryptographic key rotation is not intended to increase the cost of scheduled key rotation."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Automated cryptographic key rotation in Key Vault allows users to configure Key Vault to automatically generate a new key version at a specified frequency, which helps deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
  - content: "What is the purpose of infrastructure as code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver delicious food"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Infrastructure as code enables automation and validation of environment creation and teardown for secure and stable application hosting platforms."
    - content: "Enables the manual creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
