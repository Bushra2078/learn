    choices:
    - content: "Basic and Standard"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Files offers two performance tiers. Standard file shares are backed by reliable rotational hard disk drives (HDDs). Premium file shares are backed by high-performance, low-latency solid-state disks (SSDs)."
    - content: "Standard and Premium"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Files offers two performance tiers. Standard file shares are backed by reliable rotational hard disk drives (HDDs). Premium file shares are backed by high-performance, low-latency solid-state disks (SSDs)."
    - content: "Basic, Standard, and Premium"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Files offers two performance tiers. Standard file shares are backed by reliable rotational hard disk drives (HDDs). Premium file shares are backed by high-performance, low-latency solid-state disks (SSDs)."

    choices:
    - content: "1 TB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data disks have a maximum size of 32 TB. The VM size determines the maximum number of data disks you can attach to the VM."
    - content: "16 TB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data disks have a maximum size of 32 TB. The VM size determines the maximum number of data disks you can attach to the VM."
    - content: "32 TB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Data disks have a maximum size of 32 TB. The VM size determines the maximum number of data disks you can attach to the VM."
  - content: "Which tier of Azure managed disks should you select for IO-intensive workloads such as SAP HANA, top tier databases (for example, SQL, Oracle), and other transaction-heavy workloads? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "Standard SSD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ultra SSD managed disks have the highest performance of the four tiers."
    - content: "Premium SSD"

      explanation: "Incorrect. Ultra SSD managed disks have the highest performance of the four tiers."
    - content: "Ultra SSD"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Ultra SSD managed disks have the highest performance of the four tiers."
  - content: "SAP HANA Dynamic Tiering 2.0 (DT 2.0) offers the ability to offload less frequently accessed data from memory into extended storage. Which of the following statements about DT 2.0 is true? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "DT 2.0 does not need to be installed on a dedicated Azure VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To ensure supportability for SAP HANA Dynamic Tiering 2.0, the SAP HANA and DT 2.0 VMs must be deployed with Azure accelerated networking enabled."
    - content: "The SAP HANA and DT 2.0 VMs must be deployed with Azure accelerated networking enabled."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To ensure supportability for SAP HANA Dynamic Tiering 2.0, the SAP HANA and DT 2.0 VMs must be deployed with Azure accelerated networking enabled."
    - content: "SAP HANA and DT 2.0 VMs cannot be deployed within the same Azure virtual network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To ensure supportability for SAP HANA Dynamic Tiering 2.0, the SAP HANA and DT 2.0 VMs must be deployed with Azure accelerated networking enabled."
