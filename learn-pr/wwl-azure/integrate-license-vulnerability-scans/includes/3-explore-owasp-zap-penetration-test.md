ZAP is a free penetration testing tool for beginners to professionals. ZAP includes an API and a weekly docker container image that can be integrated into your deployment process.

Refer to the [OSWA ZAP VSTS Extension](https://github.com/deliveron/owasp-zap-vsts-extension) repo for details on how to set up the integration. Here we're going to explain the benefits of including it in your process.

The application CI/CD pipeline should run within a few minutes, so you don't want to include any long-running processes.

The baseline scan is designed to identify vulnerabilities within a couple of minutes, making it a good option for the application CI/CD pipeline.

The Nightly OWASP ZAP can spider the website and run the full-Active Scan to evaluate the most combinations of possible vulnerabilities.

OWASP ZAP can be installed on any machine in your network, but we like to use the OWASP Zap/Weekly docker container within Azure Container Services.

It allows for the latest updates to the image. It will enable spin up multiple instances of the image so several applications within an enterprise can be scanned simultaneously.

The following figure outlines the steps for the Application CI/CD pipeline and the longer-running Nightly OWASP ZAP pipeline.
