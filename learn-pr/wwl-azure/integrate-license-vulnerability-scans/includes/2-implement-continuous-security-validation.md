Today, developers don't hesitate to use components available in public package sources (such as npm or NuGet).

With faster delivery and better productivity, open-source software (OSS) components are encouraged across many organizations.

However, as the dependency on these third-party OSS components increases, the risk of security vulnerabilities or hidden license requirements also increases compliance issues.

For a business, it's critical, as issues related to compliance, liabilities, and customer personal data can cause a great deal of privacy and security concerns.

Identifying such issues early in the release cycle gives you an advanced warning and enough time to fix the issues.

Notably, the cost of rectifying issues is lower the earlier the project that the issue is discovered.

Many available tools can scan for these vulnerabilities within the build and release pipelines.
