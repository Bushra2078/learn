Visual Studio 2017 and later versions support building, debugging, and running containerized ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Core.

Both Windows and Linux containers are supported.

To containerize an [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core project, the project must target .NET Core. Both Linux and Windows containers are supported.

When adding Docker support to a project, choose either a Windows or a Linux container.

The Docker host must be running the same container type.

To change the container type in the running Docker instance, right-click the System Tray's Docker icon and choose Switch to Windows containers or Switch to Linux containers.

Follow the steps here on Microsoft Docs for a [walkthrough on adding Docker support to an existing application](/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/docker/visual-studio-tools-for-docker).
