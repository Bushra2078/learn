  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What are the two primary technologies that can be used to implement IoT device management?"
    choices:
    - content: "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You would not use Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence to implement device management."
    - content: "Direct Methods and Device Twins."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Direct Methods and Device Twins are the two technologies that you would use to implement device management."
    - content: "Azure Functions and Logic Apps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although these technologies could be used within a device management solution, they are not the two primary technologies that would be used to implement device management."
  - content: "When implementing device management using device twins, which two actions are performed on the device-side?"
    choices:
    - content: "Handles desired property changed notifications and updates reported properties."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The device side code handles desired property changed notifications and updates reported properties."
    - content: "Handles reported property changed notifications and updates reported properties."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The device side code does update reported properties but would not normally raise or handle events for reported property changes."
    - content: "Updates desired and reported properties."
