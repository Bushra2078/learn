Data is a fundamental element in any machine learning workload. In this module, you'll learn how to create and manage **datastores** and **data assets** in an Azure Machine Learning workspace, and how to use them in model training experiments.

But first, you'll learn how you can connect to data by using **Uniform resource Identifiers** (**URIs**), which are also used when working with datastores and data assets.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Work with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).
- Create and use datastores.
- Create and use data assets.
