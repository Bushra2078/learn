An Azure IoT Edge solution that supports extended offline and local storage scenarios requires configuration in the cloud and device environments.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to develop custom solutions for the IoT Edge that can be implemented as part of the company's IoT solution. You decide to gain experience developing custom IoT Edge solutions by implementing a gateway device with extended offline support and local storage within a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:

 -  Create an IoT Edge gateway device and a child IoT device.
 -  Configure communication between the IoT Edge gateway and child device.
 -  Configure the IoT Edge Gateway device Time-to-Live and Message Store.
 -  Test the device connectivity and offline support.

By the end of this module, you will be able to implement an Azure IoT Edge solution that supports extended offline and local storage scenarios.
