  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which Azure compute resource can be used to deploy to manage a set of identical virtual machines?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machine availability sets"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs within a datacenter that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability."
    - content: "Virtual machine availability zones"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Zones are unique physical locations within a region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking."
    - content: "Virtual machine scale sets"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Virtual machine scale sets let you deploy and manage a set of identical virtual machines."
  - content: "Which of the following should be used when the primary concern is to perform work in response to an event (often via a REST command) that needs a response in a few seconds?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure App Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  App Service is the blade in Azure where you find Azure Functions."
    - content: "Azure Container Instances"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  In this case you are still running a full application that may not be designed for quick responses to events."
    - content: "Azure Functions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Functions are used when you need to perform work in response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service, and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less."
  - content: "Which of the following services is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure App Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  App Service is a set of tools to help you build out cloud-only applications."
    - content: "Azure Content Delivery Network"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A Content Delivery Network is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users."
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Azure Cosmos DB is a database for storing data."
  - content: "Which of the following is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as videos and images?"
    choices:
    - content: "Blobs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data."
    - content: "Files"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Files are not optimized for storing unstructured data."
    - content: "Queues"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Queues are used for sequenced data."
  - content: "Which is true about Azure Load Balancer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic among similar systems, making your services more highly available."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If one system is unavailable, Azure Load Balancer stops sending traffic to it. It then directs traffic to one of the responsive servers."
    - content: "Azure Load Balancer works with internet-facing traffic only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Load balancer works with both internal and internet network traffic."
    - content: "You must use Azure Load Balancer if you want to distribute traffic among your virtual machines running in Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  There are other systems like Traffic Manager that can distribute network requests."
