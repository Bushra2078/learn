You will need to determine which licensing model you want to use. The available options depend on if you deploy Azure Stack Hub connected to the internet:

 -  For a ***connected deployment,*** you can choose either pay-as-you-use or capacity-based licensing. Pay-as-you-use requires a connection to Azure to report usage, which is then billed through Azure commerce.
 -  Only capacity-based licensing is supported if you deploy ***disconnected*** from the internet.
