Azure Stack Hub provides an alternative approach to the migration of existing applications that run on either physical servers or existing virtualization platforms. By moving these workloads to an Azure Stack Hub deployment IaaS environment, teams can benefit from smoother operations, self-service deployments, standardized hardware configurations, and Azure consistency.
