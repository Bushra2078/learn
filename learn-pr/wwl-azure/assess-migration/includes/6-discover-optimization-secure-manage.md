Once your solution has been fully migrated and your workloads have been put through their paces on Azure, you'll be able to evaluate the solution based on various metrics. These metrics include performance, costs, frequency, volume, gaps, and user metrics. You'll want to budget time and money to optimize the solution to maximize your budget while getting the most out of the options you've chosen.

We'll talk more about monitoring and evaluating the performance of your app in the final module of the course. The focus here's about initial, post-migration tweaking.

## Cost Management + Billing

Azure provides a robust dashboard for you to monitor specific costs for many of the services you're using with plenty of filter and sort options. You can view resources by specific service types (for example, databases) or resource groups for example. The views provided work best when you have a month or two of usage to evaluate. Still, looking at them at any time during a given billing period will enable you to see the cost (both actual and predicted) so you can assess how you're tracking to your budget.

## Compute power

When setting up certain Azure services, you'll make choices about the compute power you'll need for virtual machines, databases, networking and the like. After your migration, you can use existing tools or Azure health and performance tools to ensure you're getting the type of performance you need and expect. Be sure to test your services under stress as well so you can anticipate how your solution and workloads will perform during peak load times.

## Data storage

Some while all databases on Azure are robust, some types are built for high performance and availability under high frequency and volume conditions. These databases tend to cost more to ensure that performance. For some of your data, you may need a less (or more) robust database so optimizing the type of storage solution you need should happen both during planning but also after migration can ensure the data you need is available and ready when you need it.

You also may be able to use blob storage over other solutions for particular scenarios. Looking at the type of data storage you're using in your migration and whether another type will work better is a post-migration exercise that can help you get the most out of the solution you built. Looking at deploying a content delivery network solution (CDN) is an important consideration too if you didn't use one in your previous deployment.

## New features

While this is less important right after your migration, Azure is continually launching new features or upgrades and options to existing features so keeping an eye on the options available to you is an activity that can help you optimize your workloads or offer new features to your users.

## A business-as-usual activity

Optimization is something you'll want to continually look at so ensuring you have personnel and budget to evaluate your solution on a regular cadence can help you stay on budget while getting more out of your deployments, keep your services running well, and delight your users.

## Secure and manage

One significant change (and benefit) from moving to the cloud is that Azure services can take of security and management responsibilities that needed more direct attention from your staff. This doesn't mean you can entirely offload these responsibilities to your cloud provider. Security is something everyone is responsible for.

But understanding what Azure services do "out of the box" and what you'll need to pay more attention to is a planning, post-migration, and continuous set of tasks.

## Continuous deployment

In today's world, software is continually being updated, fixed, and changed. This primarily is a benefit but can also pose a risk if you take a "set it and forget it" approach.

Being aware of upcoming breaking changes to services you use, bug fixes, the addition of new features, and open security issues are something you and your staff will need to make a regular priority.

This may mean you need regular budget to ensure your staff is regularly trained and you may need a project manager or two whose sole responsibility it's to keep on top of management and security changes in your deployment, inform your staff, and plan for the work involved to accommodate any upcoming changes.

## Use the tools

Azure provides a host of robust tools that you can use to stay on top of your workloads and evaluate everything from performance to costs. Understanding and using these tools should be a regular part of your business cadence. The function of some tools may not have been a part of your previous solution so be sure to look at all that Azure has to offer and don't focus on finding analogs to what you were using before.

You may also want to migrate analytical tools you used in your previous deployment to Azure-provided tooling. This is something you can evaluate and work towards over time and could also be another area where you can save costs and effort.
