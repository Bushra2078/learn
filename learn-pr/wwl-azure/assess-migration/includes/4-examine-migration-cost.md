Cost can be a significant factor, and inhibitor, when considering moving to the cloud. Happily, Azure provides many tools to help with your cost analysis and planning.

It's also important to make sure you have clear costs for your existing solution that includes not only the current operational costs, but *the costs of any planned upgrades*. This is important as you think about migration because while current operating costs may be lower than the same costs on a cloud solution, upgrades can be significantly more expensive than a migration and needs to be considered in your overall financial picture.

So really, you're considering these two primary questions:

1. What does my solution currently cost (operating costs and planned upgrades)?
2. What would the same solution cost to operate on Azure?

## Azure Cost Analysis Tools

In order to use these tools effectively, you'll need to have your discovery complete so you know which services and tooling you'll be bringing over to the cloud. A spreadsheet may be a good tool to use here so you can have a column with your existing apps and services in one column, how much they currently cost in another, and then evaluate the cost for the migrated app or service in Azure.

## Design Choices

How you architect your solution will impact many things including performance, uptime, and cost. When evaluating the cost of various workloads, you may have to make some design trade-offs to stay within budget. Having your architectural team constantly reviewing any cost adjustments you need to make will be essential.
