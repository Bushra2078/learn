This stage is key to your success. Understanding the workload that you're looking to move will help to make the migration and further stages much more successful by helping you to avoid any 'gotchas.'

## Dependencies

Your workloads, servers, apps, don’t run in isolation. They're all interconnected so finding out what ports, services, connections are being made between each of them is important.  This process will help you group your work loads together and also design the best way forward to migrate your app to a PaaS solution.

The bigger your solution is and the longer it has been around, the more likely it is that there are dark corners of the solution that was created by a staff member or team that is long gone and no one on your current staff really knows how it works. These can be the most sticky areas to migrate and may require more attention than the areas that have much more focus. But don't forget about these areas because sometime critical functions and workloads live in the dark corners.

## End users

A migration project isn’t just about technology, you need to understand how your end users utilize the app, workloads, what they don't and do like about the existing solution, and how they access it. A migration is a good time to consider which problems you're going to solve and which ones you'll put off until later.  But be mindful of what your end user experience will be like when you migrate to PaaS.

Moving to the cloud can also enable new opportunities for your users and it can be tempting to want to enable or build new features while you're doing the migration. A best practice is to consider enabling or developing new features and migrating existing functionality as separate workloads. Write down everything so you can be sure to consider how to make your end user experience better. But avoid the temptation to "wow" your users by lighting up new features. It will slow down your migration and could cause bigger problems if you take on too much.

## Staff training

You should also look at what training your staff will need prior to and as the migration progresses. Answer the question: what will they need in order to support this workload going forward if it is hosted in Azure?

Answering that question requires that you know what the needs will be which can be impossible up front. Plan to develop a training plan over time as you learn more about the migrated solution. Staff training and adequate documentation can sometimes be seen as a "nice to have," many times it turns into a "completely forgotten." While there's much work involved in having adequate documentation and staff training it will pay off in the long-term.

## Write it all down

Document all your discoveries, all your findings, all your thoughts and start to build that picture of your environment with a view to migrating it to Azure.

Keeping adequate documentation is critical when planning for a migration particularly a large one.
