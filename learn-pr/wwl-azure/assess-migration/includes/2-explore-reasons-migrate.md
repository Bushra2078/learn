You may have heard that "the cloud" is the place to be and you're considering making the move. But you've invested years if not decades in your existing solution and the old adage, "if it's not broke, don't fix it" keeps ringing in your ears. Besides, you've heard it can be expense and a lot of work to make the move. So why do it?

The way to frame an answer to the question is to think of the labor and monetary expenses as an **investment** that should have a short-, medium-, and long-term return. We'll talk about all the advantages Azure's cloud platforms provide throughout this course. In this module, we'll talk about the challenges managing on-premises web apps (and compiled code apps) and how Azure can help mitigate those challenges.

Remember that complex migrations like these don't happen all at once. There may be a lengthy list of tasks you'll have to complete to get a full migration done. But you'll be able to work in phases so you can learn-as-you-go and make decisions along the way.

## Reasons to Migrate

Here are some common drivers that engineers and planners consider when thinking about migrating to Azure. Some you may have been thinking about and others you may not have considered. Together they make a compelling case for moving to the cloud.

### Datacenter contracts expiry

If you're in a contract with a specific datacenter and that contract is about to expire, it may be a good time to consider a move to the cloud.

### Quickly integrate acquisitions

Bringing on the technology stacks of acquisitions typically are time-consuming and difficult. Moving to cloud solutions can reduce this friction (particularly when the acquisition is on the same cloud platform) by removing hardware considerations. Making it easier to expand capacity and reducing the need to think about the physical location of your solution relative to personnel.

### Urgent capacity needs

Scaling up and scaling out--particularly in urgent situations--can be challenging when you need to purchase hardware, infrastructure, and networking capacity. Moving to Azure reduces the friction when scaling up and out and has a pay-as-you go model so you pay only for what you use.

### Software and hardware refresh

In the theme of the item above, updating hardware can, itself, be expensive and time-consuming. Many times upgrading is delayed until disaster strikes. The cloud's distributed model all but eliminates this later concern and hardware and software upgrades are handled by your "IT support in the cloud" so to speak so you rarely have to think about it.

### Security threats

While no system is entirely secure, staying on top of daily threats, the need to invest in modern hardware and "edge" systems to keep threats at bay, and ensuring software is up-to-date to patch issues that can threaten your infrastructure makes on-premises solutions vulnerable.

### Compliance

Azure is consistently updated with compliance-related tools to help you ensure your software meets or exceeds the latest federal, local, and "good human" standards. Monitoring tools can inform you of issues before they're issues.

### Application innovation

Software doesn't write itself (at least not yet) but being on a cloud solution can reduce friction for ensuring your application is taking advantage of the latest technology. This not only includes the technology your employees or customers experience, but many of the back-end tech that makes your application more secure, run more efficiently, and easier to monitor and maintain.

### Software end of support

When software companies decide to end support of an application it can leave businesses in a bind. While cloud software platforms do retire technology, typically there are new options available and a long runway to make that migration.
