Azure Marketplace provides access and information on solutions and services available from Microsoft and our partners. Users can discover, try, or buy cloud software solutions built on or for Azure. The catalog provides Azure building blocks, such as Virtual Machines (VMs), APIs, Azure apps, Solution Templates and managed applications, SaaS apps, containers, and consulting services.

After you deployed a VM in Azure, you follow the same guidelines and tools to install the SAP software and/or DBMS inside your VM as you would do in an on-premises environment. The installation can be performed manually or in an automated manner, by using configuration management tools, such as PowerShell DSC, Custom Script, Ansible, Puppet, or Chef (most of which are available in the form of Azure VM Extensions).

## Custom images

This approach involves deploying VMs based on customer-specific images, which can be used in cases where Azure Marketplace images might not fit your needs. The process of preparing custom images is operating system specific. For details, refer to: 

* Windows: [Upload a generalized Windows VHD and use it to create new VMs in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/upload-generalized-managed) 

* Linux: 

    * **SUSE**: [Prepare a SLES or openSUSE Leap virtual machine for Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/suse-create-upload-vhd)

    * **Red Hat**: [Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine for Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/redhat-create-upload-vhd) 

    * **Oracle Linux**: [Prepare an Oracle Linux virtual machine for Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/oracle-create-upload-vhd) 

If you have already installed SAP content in your on-premises VM (especially for 2-Tier systems), you can adapt the SAP system settings after the deployment of the Azure VM through the instance rename procedure supported by the SAP Software Provisioning Manager (SAP Note 1619720).

> [!NOTE]
> In this case, you also have the option of installing and configuring SAP workloads manually or in an automated manner, using the same configuration management tools listed earlier. 

## Deployment using the Azure portal

The Azure portal offers intuitive interface for performing most common administrative tasks. Its primary advantage is simplicity, although its usage precludes (to a large extent) the use of automation. 

## Deployment using Microsoft Azure PowerShell cmdlets

PowerShell is a powerful and extensible framework that has been widely adopted by customers deploying larger numbers of systems in Azure. It is a common choice for administrators with Windows background, although with release of PowerShell 6.0, it became possible to run it also on Linux and iOS.

## Deployment using Microsoft Azure CLI commands

For administrators with Linux background, it might be more convenient to use Azure CLI as an alternative to PowerShell. The Azure CLI integrates closely with Bash shell.

Deployment of the Azure Monitoring Extension for SAP is available using PowerShell or CLI and is a mandatory step when deploying or administering an SAP NetWeaver system in Azure.

## Deployment using Azure Resource Management templates

You can automate deployment of SAP solutions by creating your own Azure Resource Manager templates, or by leveraging a large collection of azure-quickstart-templates in a GitHub repository at [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) . The templates include:

* **SAP NetWeaver 2-tier compatible template using a Marketplace image:** This template takes a minimum number of parameters and deploys a VM that is customized for use with SAP NetWeaver, using the latest patched version of the selected operating system. This is a template for a 2-tier configuration. It deploys one server on either Standard or Premium Storage.

## Deployment using Terraform

Hashicorp Terraform is an open-source tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure. It codifies infrastructure in configuration files that describe the topology of cloud resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking interfaces. Terraform's command-line interface (CLI) provides a simple mechanism to both deploy and version the configuration files to Azure or any other supported cloud.

Terraform is a popular tool choice for multi-cloud scenarios, where similar infrastructure is deployed to Azure and additional cloud providers or on-premises datacenters. It enables developers to use the same tools and configuration files to manage infrastructure on multiple cloud providers.

The GitHub repository entitled Automated SAP Deployments in Azure Cloud contain a set of highly customizable templates that can be used to automatically deploy complex SAP landscapes in the Azure Cloud. The templates are split into:

* Terraform modules, which deploy the infrastructure components (such as VMs, network, storage) in Azure and then call the:

* Ansible playbooks, which run different roles to install and configure SAP HANA and required applications on the already deployed infrastructure.

The supported scenarios include the full deployment of:

* HANA single-node instance.

* HANA high-availability pair, consisting of:

    * single-node HANA instance, two-tier HSR (primary and secondary).

    * Pacemaker high-availability cluster, fully configured with SBD and SAP/Azure resource agents.
