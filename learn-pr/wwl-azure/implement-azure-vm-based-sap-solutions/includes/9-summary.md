In this module you reviewed the deployment methodologies of SAP workloads in Azure. You saw how to deploy Azure Marketplace and custom images using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, and Azure PowerShell cmdlets. Additionally, you considered the following:

* How using Azure Marketplace images involves deploying VMs based on Microsoft or third-party provided VM images from the Azure Marketplace.
* How to deploy VMs based on customer-specific images, using Windows or Linux, such as SUSE and RedHat.
* Methodologies for deployment using Microsoft Azure CLI commands, Azure PowerShell cmdlets, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

You saw that for HANA-based NetWeaver deployments you use one of the following methods:

* Use SAP Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM) as part of the standard (2-tier) or distributed (3-tier) NetWeaver installation, followed by HANA installation.
* Use the SAP HANA database lifecycle manager (HDBLCM) tool, and then install NetWeaver.

Finally, you assessed the implementation details for SAP NetWeaver deployment scenarios with AnyDB on Azure VMs and the steps for preparing Azure infrastructure for installing a high-availability SAP system on a Windows failover cluster hosting an SAP ASCS instance.
