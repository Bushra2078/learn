**Helm** is a package manager for Kubernetes. It makes it easier to package, configure, and deploy applications and services.

**helm** (lower-case) is the command-line tool that provides a user interface to the functionality of Helm.

**tiller** was a server-side component that executed Helm packages. From Helm 3 onwards, a tiller will no longer be required.

Helm packages are called **charts** and are implemented in YAML.

There are public and private repositories for Helm charts.

For more information on Helm, see [Helm](https://helm.sh/).
