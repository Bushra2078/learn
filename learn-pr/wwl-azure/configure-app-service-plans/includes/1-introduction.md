Azure Architects need to be able to scale a web application. Scaling enables an application to remain responsive during periods of high demand. Scaling also helps to save money by reducing the resources required when demand drops.

In this module, suppose you work for a large chain of hotels. You're responsible for maintaining the hotel website. Customers visit the website to make new reservations and view details for their current bookings. At certain times of the year, the volume of website traffic grows because customers are browsing hotels for vacations during national/regional holidays. At other times, traffic declines. These website usage patterns are predictable.

You're supporting the hotel website by providing scale up and down, and scale in and out. You're implementing Azure App Service plans to enable the scaling.
