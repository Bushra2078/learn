There are two methods for Web App scaling, **scale up** and **scale out**. Apps can be scaled manually or automatically (autoscale). Watch this video on how to automatically scale your app service.

**Scale up**. Get more CPU, memory, disk space, and extra features like dedicated virtual machines (VMs), custom domains and certificates, staging slots, autoscaling, and more. You scale up by changing the pricing tier of the App Service plan that your app belongs to.

**Scale out**: Increase the number of VM instances that run your app. You can scale out to as many as 30 instances, depending on your pricing tier. App Service Environments in Isolated tier further increases your scale-out count to 100 instances. The scale instance count can be configured manually or automatically (autoscale). Autoscale is based on predefined rules and schedules.

## Changing your App Service plan (scale up)

Your App Service plan can be scaled up and down at any time. It's as simple as changing the pricing tier of the plan. You can choose a lower pricing tier at first and scale up later when you need more App Service features.

For example, you can start testing your web app in a Free App Service plan and pay nothing. When you want to add your custom DNS name to the web app, just scale your plan up to the Shared tier. Later, when you want to create an SSL binding, scale your plan up to Basic tier. When you want to have staging environments, scale up to Standard tier. When you need more cores, memory, or storage, scale up to a bigger VM size in the same tier.

The same works in the reverse. When you feel you no longer need the capabilities or features of a higher tier, you can scale down to a lower tier, which saves you money.

## Other considerations

 -  The scale settings take only seconds to apply and affect all apps in your App Service plan. They don't require you to change your code or redeploy your application.
 -  If your app depends on other services, such as Azure SQL Database or Azure Storage, you can scale up these resources separately. These resources aren't managed by the App Service plan.
