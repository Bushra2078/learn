The Azure managed identity is a free feature that's included with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can use this feature to authenticate an identity to any Azure service that supports Azure AD.
In this module, you explored service principals on the Azure platform. You saw how to use managed identities instead of service principals to authenticate your applications. If your code runs on a supported service, managed identities offer a more automated and secure way to manage credentials. Managed identities reduce the complexity of application authentication.

Now that you have completed this module, you will be able to:
- Design a solution that securely stores passwords and secrets
- Design a solution for integrating applications into Azure AD 
- Design an access solution for applications 
- Design solutions to allow applications to access Azure resources
