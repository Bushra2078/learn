In this module, you learned about the importance of configuring user rights and following the principle of least privilege. Least privilege involves granting users only the rights and privileges they need to perform their tasks, and no more. This way, if an unauthorized user compromises an account, they gain access only to the limited set of privileges assigned to that account. You also learned about the need for IT staff to have separate accounts for day-to-day activities and administrative tasks. The module also covered various user rights assignment policies such as Function Access Credential Manager, Act as part of the operating system, Adjust memory quotas for a process, and many others.
