Performance is one of the considerations for using Azure Cosmos DB as your NoSQL solutions.  Regardless if it's a new database you're creating or an existing MongoDB database that you're migrating to an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account, the database performance is important. To achieve this, we should consider the modeling, sharding, and indexing of our Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB database and collections. In this module, we'll introduce you to Azure Cosmos DB modeling, sharding and indexing. Additionally we'll also introduce you to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB support for MongoDB aggregation pipelines. These pipelines allow developers to create more sophisticated queries and manipulate data by combining multiple aggregation ‘stages’ together.

## Designing databases for Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Understand how modeling and sharding affect the performance of your Azure Cosmos DB database.
- Learn about different index types we can use in an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB collection.
- Learn about the support for MongoDB aggregation pipelines in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB.
