Azure Cosmos DB performance is improved when the right model, using the proper shard keys and indexes are used. In this excersice we will use the Azure portal to review these topics. 

This exercise can be completed using a Microsoft Learn *sandbox*, which provides a temporary Azure subscription. To activate the sandbox subscription, you must sign in using a Microsoft account. The sandbox subscription will be automatically deleted when you complete this module. After the sandbox has been activated, [sign into the Azure portal using the credentials for your sandbox subscription](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). Ensure you're working in the **Microsoft Learn Sandbox** directory - indicated at the top right of the portal under your user ID. If not, select the user icon and switch directory.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer, you can use your own Azure subscription. To do so, [sign into the Azure portal using credentials for your subscription](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true). Ensure you are working in the directory containing your subscription - indicated at the top right under your user ID. If not, select the user icon and switch directory.

In this exercise, we will load the sample data from the Sandbox and then we will open the azure portal to run some queries.

To start this exercise, use the sandbox or your own environment and follow these [exercise instructions](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-cosmosdb/blob/87081170e69e81b68c38d05cdc7cdf85c756239d/api-for-mongodb/instructions/02-models-shard-keys-and-indexes/models-shard-keys-and-indexes.md ).

Once you've completed this exercise, continue to the knowledge check questions for this module.
