Tailwind Traders currently runs its workloads on-premises, in its datacenter. As the Tailwind Traders Enterprise IT team prepares to define the strategy to migrate some of companyâ€™s workloads to Azure, it must identify the required networking components and design a network infrastructure necessary to support them. Considering the global scope of its operations, Tailwind Traders will be using multiple Azure regions to host its applications. Most of these applications have dependencies on infrastructure and data services, which will also reside in Azure. Internal applications migrated to Azure must remain accessible to Tailwind Traders users. Internet-facing applications migrated to Azure must remain accessible to any external customer. 

In this module you will learn how the networking services in Azure provide a variety of networking capabilities that can be used together or separately to meet your requirements. Take note of which services you think Tailwind Traders will need for their production environment in Azure.

##Gather Network Requirments 

### Naming

All Azure resources have a name. The name must be unique within a scope, that may vary for each resource type. For example, the name of a virtual network must be unique within a resource group, but can be duplicated within a subscription or Azure region. Defining a naming convention that you can use consistently when naming resources is helpful when managing several network resources over time. 

### Regions

All Azure resources are created in an Azure region and subscription. A resource can only be created in a virtual network that exists in the same region and subscription as the resource. You can however, connect virtual networks that exist in different subscriptions and regions. For more information, see connectivity. When deciding which region(s) to deploy resources in, consider where consumers of the resources are physically located:

- Consumers of resources typically want the lowest network latency to their resources. 
- Do you have data residency, sovereignty, compliance, or resiliency requirements? If so, choosing the region that aligns to the requirements is critical. 
- Do you require resiliency across Azure Availability Zones within the same Azure region for the resources you deploy? You can deploy resources, such as virtual machines (VM) to different availability zones within the same virtual network. Not all Azure regions support availability zones however.

###Subscriptions

You can deploy as many virtual networks as required within each subscription, up to the limit. Some organizations have different subscriptions for different departments, for example. 

###Segmentation
You can create multiple virtual networks per subscription and per region. You can create multiple subnets within each virtual network. The considerations that follow help you determine how many virtual networks and subnets you require:

**Virtual networks**
A virtual network is a virtual, isolated portion of the Azure public network. Each virtual network is dedicated to your subscription. Things to consider when deciding whether to create one virtual network, or multiple virtual networks in a subscription:

- Do any organizational security requirements exist for isolating traffic into separate virtual networks? You can choose to connect virtual networks or not. If you connect virtual networks, you can implement a network virtual appliance, such as a firewall, to control the flow of traffic between the virtual networks. For more information, see security and connectivity.
- Do any organizational requirements exist for isolating virtual networks into separate subscriptions or regions?
- A network interface enables a VM to communicate with other resources. Each network interface has one or more private IP addresses assigned to it. How many network interfaces and private IP addresses do you require in a virtual network? There are limits to the number of network interfaces and private IP addresses that you can have within a virtual network.
- Do you want to connect the virtual network to another virtual network or on-premises network? You may choose to connect some virtual networks to each other or on-premises networks, but not others. For more information, see connectivity. Each virtual network that you connect to another virtual network, or on-premises network, must have a unique address space. Each virtual network has one or more public or private address ranges assigned to its address space. An address range is specified in classless internet domain routing (CIDR) format, such as 10.0.0.0/16. Learn more about address ranges for virtual networks.
- Do you have any organizational administration requirements for resources in different virtual networks? If so, you might separate resources into separate virtual network to simplify permission assignment to individuals in your organization or to assign different policies to different virtual networks.
- When you deploy some Azure service resources into a virtual network, they create their own virtual network. To determine whether an Azure service creates its own virtual network, see information for each Azure service that can be deployed into a virtual network.

**Subnets**
A virtual network can be segmented into one or more subnets up to the limits. Things to consider when deciding whether to create one subnet, or multiple virtual networks in a subscription:

- Each subnet must have a unique address range, specified in CIDR format, within the address space of the virtual network. The address range cannot overlap with other subnets in the virtual network.
- If you plan to deploy some Azure service resources into a virtual network, they may require, or create, their own subnet, so there must be enough unallocated space for them to do so. To determine whether an Azure service creates its own subnet, see information for each Azure service that can be deployed into a virtual network. For example, if you connect a virtual network to an on-premises network using an Azure VPN Gateway, the virtual network must have a dedicated subnet for the gateway. Learn more about gateway subnets.
- Azure routes network traffic between all subnets in a virtual network, by default. You can override Azure's default routing to prevent Azure routing between subnets, or to route traffic between subnets through a network virtual appliance, for example. If you require that traffic between resources in the same virtual network flow through a network virtual appliance (NVA), deploy the resources to different subnets. Learn more in security.
- You can limit access to Azure resources such as an Azure storage account or Azure SQL Database, to specific subnets with a virtual network service endpoint. Further, you can deny access to the resources from the internet. You may create multiple subnets, and enable a service endpoint for some subnets, but not others. Learn more about service endpoints, and the Azure resources you can enable them for.
- You can associate zero or one network security group to each subnet in a virtual network. You can associate the same, or a different, network security group to each subnet. Each network security group contains rules, which allow or deny traffic to and from sources and destinations. Learn more about network security groups.

###Security
You can filter network traffic to and from resources in a virtual network using network security groups and network virtual appliances. You can control how Azure routes traffic from subnets. You can also limit who in your organization can work with resources in virtual networks.

**Traffic filtering**
- You can filter network traffic between resources in a virtual network using a network security group, an NVA that filters network traffic, or both. To deploy an NVA, such as a firewall, to filter network traffic, see the Azure Marketplace. When using an NVA, you also create custom routes to route traffic from subnets to the NVA. Learn more about traffic routing.
- A network security group contains several default security rules that allow or deny traffic to or from resources. A network security group can be associated to a network interface, the subnet the network interface is in, or both. To simplify management of security rules, it's recommended that you associate a network security group to individual subnets, rather than individual network interfaces within the subnet, whenever possible.
- If different VMs within a subnet need different security rules applied to them, you can associate the network interface in the VM to one or more application security groups. A security rule can specify an application security group in its source, destination, or both. That rule then only applies to the network interfaces that are members of the application security group. Learn more about network security groups and application security groups.
- Azure creates several default security rules within each network security group. One default rule allows all traffic to flow between all resources in a virtual network. To override this behavior, use network security groups, custom routing to route traffic to an NVA, or both. It's recommended that you familiarize yourself with all of Azure's default security rules and understand how network security group rules are applied to a resource.

**Traffic routing**
Azure creates several default routes for outbound traffic from a subnet. You can override Azure's default routing by creating a route table and associating it to a subnet. Common reasons for overriding Azure's default routing are:

- Because you want traffic between subnets to flow through an NVA. To learn more about how to configure route tables to force traffic through an NVA.
- Because you want to force all internet-bound traffic through an NVA, or on-premises, through an Azure VPN gateway. Forcing internet traffic on-premises for inspection and logging is often referred to as forced tunneling. Learn more about how to configure forced tunneling.


## Best practice: Plan IP addressing

When you create virtual networks as part of your migration, it's important to plan out your virtual network IP address space.

You should assign an address space that isn't larger than a CIDR range of /16 for each virtual network. Virtual networks allow for the use of 65,536 IP addresses. Assigning a smaller prefix than /16, such as a /15, which has 131,072 addresses, will result in the excess IP addresses becoming unusable elsewhere. It's important not to waste IP addresses, even if they're in the private ranges defined by RFC 1918.

Other tips for planning are:

- The virtual network address space shouldn't overlap with on-premises network ranges.

- Overlapping addresses can cause networks that can't be connected, and routing that doesn't work properly.

- If networks overlap, you'll need to redesign the network.

- If you absolutely can't redesign the network, network address translation (NAT) can help but should be avoided or limited as much as possible.

## Best practice: Implement a hub and spoke network topology

A hub and spoke network topology isolates workloads while sharing services, such as identity and security. The hub is an Azure virtual network that acts as a central point of connectivity. The spokes are virtual networks that connect to the hub virtual network by using peering. Shared services are deployed in the hub, while individual workloads are deployed as spokes.

Consider the following:

- Implementing a hub and spoke topology in Azure centralizes common services, such as connections to on-premises networks, firewalls, and isolation between virtual networks. The hub virtual network provides a central point of connectivity to on-premises networks, and a place to host services used by workloads hosted in spoke virtual networks.

- A hub and spoke configuration is typically used by larger enterprises. Smaller networks might consider a simpler design to save on costs and complexity.

- You can use spoke virtual networks to isolate workloads, with each spoke managed separately from other spokes. Each workload can include multiple tiers, and multiple subnets that are connected with Azure load balancers.

- You can implement hub and spoke virtual networks in different resource groups, and even in different subscriptions. When you peer virtual networks in different subscriptions, the subscriptions can be associated to the same, or different, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants. This allows for decentralized management of each workload, while sharing services maintained in the hub network.

## Best practice: Design subnets

To provide isolation within a virtual network, you segment it into one or more subnets, and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet.

- You can create multiple subnets within each virtual network.

- By default, Azure routes network traffic between all subnets in a virtual network.

- Your subnet decisions are based on your technical and organizational requirements.

- You create subnets by using CIDR notation.

When you're deciding on network range for subnets, be aware that Azure retains five IP addresses from each subnet that can't be used. For example, if you create the smallest available subnet of /29 (with eight IP addresses), Azure will retain five addresses. In this case, you only have three usable addresses that can be assigned to hosts on the subnet. For most cases, use /28 as the smallest subnet.

**Example:**

The table shows an example of a virtual network with an address space of 10.245.16.0/20 segmented into subnets, for a planned migration.

| **Subnet**| **CIDR**| **Addresses**| **Usage** |
| - | - | - | - |
| DEV-FE-EUS2| 10.245.16.0/22| 1019| Front-end or web-tier VMs |
| DEV-APP-EUS2| 10.245.20.0/22| 1019| Application-tier VMs |
| DEV-DB-EUS2| 10.245.24.0/23| 507| Database VMs |
