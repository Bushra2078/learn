In this module, you've learned how to filter objects out of the pipeline by using the **Where-Object** cmdlet to specify various criteria. The following are the key takeaways:

 -  The PowerShell comparison operators are used to compare a particular property of an object to a value. They help inform PowerShell of the objects that need to be retained and those that need to be removed from the pipeline.
 -  The **Where-Object** command has basic and advanced forms of syntax. Both forms are defined by an extensive list of parameter setsâ€”one for each comparison operator.
 -  The advanced syntax of **Where-Object** uses a filter script, which is a script block that contains the comparison and that you pass by using the *-FilterScript* parameter.
 -  Many PowerShell scripters use the mnemonic *filter left* to help them remember to do the correct thing when they're optimizing performance.
