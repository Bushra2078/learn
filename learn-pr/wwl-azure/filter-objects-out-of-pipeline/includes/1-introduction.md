In this module, you'll learn how to filter objects out of the pipeline by using the **Where-Object** cmdlet to specify various criteria. This differs from the ability of **Select-Object** to select several objects from a collection because it provides more flexibility. With this new technique, you'll be able to keep or remove objects based on criteria of almost any complexity.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- List the major PowerShell comparison operators.
- Explain how to filter objects by using basic syntax.
- Explain how to filter objects by using advanced syntax.
- Explain how to optimize filtering performance in the pipeline.

- Windows networking technologies and implementation.
- Windows Server administration, maintenance, and troubleshooting.
- Windows PowerShell and its commands to perform specific tasks.
