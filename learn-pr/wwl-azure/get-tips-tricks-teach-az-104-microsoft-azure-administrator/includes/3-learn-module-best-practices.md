As an educator, you play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. Skilling our future generations is critical work. The AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator course exposes students to the Azure administrator role, which serves as part of a larger team dedicated to implementing an organization's cloud infrastructure. Students preparing for the exam should have hands-on experience administering Azure, along with a strong understanding of core Azure services, Azure workloads, security, and governance. In addition, students should have experience using PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure portal, and Azure Resource Manager templates.
