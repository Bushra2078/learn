### Module 4 Tips and Tricks 

- Explain that this module is the biggest module of the entire course 

- Emphasize that 30-35% of the exam comes from the Network services discussed in Modules 4, 5, and 6 

- Discuss that virtual networks rely on the physical structure of Azure 

   - Consider using a Microsoft Whiteboard to diagram the physical components of the Microsoft Global Network that work behind the scenes of Azure virtual networks 

- Understand that many of the concepts are going to be new to the student, some of these services do not exist on-premises 

   - For example, network security groups 

- Teach concepts as-is. Avoid trying to find equivalents 

- For example, avoid associating network security groups with firewalls 

- Consider presenting the labs as demonstrations 

- Allow plenty of time to cover the materials
