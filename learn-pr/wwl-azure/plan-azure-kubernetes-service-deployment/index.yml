title: Plan an Azure Kubernetes Service deployment
summary: Azure Kubernetes Service provides reliable scheduling of fault-tolerant application workloads, making it the leading platform for container orchestration. In this module, you learn about the core Kubernetes infrastructure components, including control plane nodes, node pools, and workload resources such as pods, deployments, and sets.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  * Describe control plane nodes, node pools, and workload resources like pods, deployments, and sets.
  * Scheduling of fault-tolerant application workloads using Azure Kubernetes Service.
  * Managing deployment and core management tasks, like upgrade coordination using Azure Kubernetes Service.
  * Clustering of virtual or on-premises machines called nodes that share compute, network, and storage resources.
