Earlier in this module we highlighted that an app can be monitored in Application Insights with, or without, adding code. In this unit we'll cover that in more detail.

## Auto-instrumentation

Auto-instrumentation allows you to enable application monitoring with Application Insights without changing your code.

Application Insights is integrated with various resource providers and works on different environments. In essence, all you have to do is enable and - in some cases - configure the agent, which will collect the telemetry automatically. In no time, you'll see the metrics, requests, and dependencies in your Application Insights resource, which will allow you to spot the source of potential problems before they occur, and analyze the root cause with end-to-end transaction view.

The list of services that are supported by auto-instrumentation changes rapidly, visit this [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/codeless-overview#supported-environments-languages-and-resource-providers) for a list of what is currently supported.

## Instrumenting for distributed tracing

Distributed tracing is the equivalent of call stacks for modern cloud and microservices architectures, with the addition of a simplistic performance profiler thrown in. In Azure Monitor, we provide two experiences for consuming distributed trace data. The first is our transaction diagnostics view, which is like a call stack with a time dimension added in. The transaction diagnostics view provides visibility into one single transaction/request, and is helpful for finding the root cause of reliability issues and performance bottlenecks on a per request basis.

Azure Monitor also offers an application map view which aggregates many transactions to show a topological view of how the systems interact, and what the average performance and error rates are.

### How to enable distributed tracing

Enabling distributed tracing across the services in an application is as simple as adding the proper SDK or library to each service, based on the language the service was implemented in.

### Enabling via Application Insights SDKs

The Application Insights SDKs for .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, and JavaScript all support distributed tracing natively. 

With the proper Application Insights SDK installed and configured, tracing information is automatically collected for popular frameworks, libraries, and technologies by SDK dependency auto-collectors. The full list of supported technologies is available in the Dependency auto-collection documentation.

Additionally, any technology can be tracked manually with a call to `TrackDependency` on the `TelemetryClient`.

### Enable via OpenCensus

In addition to the Application Insights SDKs, Application Insights also supports distributed tracing through OpenCensus. OpenCensus is an open source, vendor-agnostic, single distribution of libraries to provide metrics collection and distributed tracing for services. It also enables the open source community to enable distributed tracing with popular technologies like Redis, Memcached, or MongoDB.
