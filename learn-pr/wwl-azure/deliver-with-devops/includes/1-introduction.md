Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are important concepts in DevOps that focus on building, testing, and automating the delivery of software artifacts.

Imagine you work for a software development company in the retail industry that is preparing to release a new version of their online store application. The company wants to ensure that the release process is efficient, reliable, and minimizes the risk of errors. Therefore, you have decided to follow a DevOps approach and leverage GitHub for software lifecycle management. By implementing CI/CD, the company can automate the build, test, and deployment processes, reducing manual effort and improving the overall quality of the software. This allows the company to deliver new features and bug fixes to their users quickly and consistently.

In this module, you will learn about continuous delivery (CD) and its benefits, as well as its relationship with continuous integration (CI), infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its principles, applying CI/CD practices to IaC deployment, progressive exposure techniques in continuous delivery, and will be introduced to GitHub Actions and its components, including how to create a GitHub Actions workflow. 

The goal of this module is to provide you with an understanding of CI/CD concepts, the benefits they offer, and how to implement them using tools like GitHub Actions. By the end of this module, you will be able to apply CI/CD practices to your software development workflows and improve the efficiency and reliability of your software releases.
