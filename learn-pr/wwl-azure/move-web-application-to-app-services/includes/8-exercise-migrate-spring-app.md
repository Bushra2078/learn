In this exercise, you'll have the opportunity to migrate a Spring App (formerly Spring Cloud app) to Azure. You'll need an Azure subscription to complete the lab. If you don't have a subscription, instruction on how you can sign up for a free or student account can be found in the instructions. 

If you want to migrate your own app, you can follow the steps in the lab but run them on your own server.
