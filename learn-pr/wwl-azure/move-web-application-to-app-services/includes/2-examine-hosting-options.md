When it comes to hosting your web app on Azure, you have a few ways to do it. Each has its advantages and deciding which way you'll want to go depends on many factors like cost, ease of maintenance, and performance among others. Let's review some of these and examine the advantages of each.

## Azure App Service

Probably the most straightforward type of deployment and one that offers a solid balance of performance and customization is using Azure App Service for your web app.

With Azure App Service, you can develop in various languages, run your app on Windows or Linux, start with templated apps (for example, WordPress and Drupal), and integrate with Azure DevOps services like continuous deployment. In addition, updates to the underlying architecture are handled for you, the service ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant, and the cost model is elastic: you only pay for the compute resources you use. For a full introduction to this service, see the [Microsoft Docs article on Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/overview).

## Static architecture options

As the name implies, these types of web app deployments are useful if you don't need server-side rendering. These essentially are fully rendered web files that are delivered to the end user. While they can take advantage of some PaaS (Platform as a Service) options like Azure Functions, they're designed for specific scenarios where you don't need a web server to perform operations.

### Static web apps

Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys web apps to Azure from a code repository. One advantage of this type of deployment is that Static Web Apps interacts directly with GitHub or Azure DevOps to automatically monitor, build, and deploy changes from a code repository whenever a commit or pull request occurs on a specified branch.

Static web apps are commonly built using libraries and frameworks like Angular, React, Svelte, Vue, or Blazor where server side rendering isn't required. In addition, these deployments support "serverless" API architectures, like integrated Azure Functions API or linking to an existing Azure Functions app.

### Static web apps on Azure Storage

Similar to Static Web Apps, you can also serve static web files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, documents) from Azure Storage (for example, blog storage). There are [some other limitations](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website) relative to Static Web Apps but this approach can be a quick and relatively inexpensive way to deliver your web app to your users.

## Virtual machine

You may already be familiar with this technology as it's been around for many years. A virtual machine (VM) approach to hosting is essentially a computer in the cloud where you have control over the type of operating system you can deploy (Windows or Linux), the settings on that computer, the software you install, and how all if it's configured. This type of hosting gives you the most control, but it also can be the most expensive depending on how much compute power you need, networking needs etc.

A word of caution: when using VMs, you're responsible for all server software installation, configuration, maintenance, and operating system patches. When considering using a VM to host your web app, you'll have to decide whether the level of control you'll need is worth the responsibilities you'll take on.
