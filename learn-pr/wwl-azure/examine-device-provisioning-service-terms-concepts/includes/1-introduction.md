The Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service enables the provisioning of IoT devices using a combination of enrollment, provisioning, and attestation features.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs to manage the deployment of thousands of devices and has determined that they will use the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. Understanding how the service works will help to ensure that deployments are successful. You decide to examine the underlying deployment terms and concepts before digging deeper into the service technology.

In this module, you will:

 -  Review the phases of device provisioning.
 -  Examine the concepts and features of Device Provisioning Service deployments.
 -  Examine device enrollment concepts and attestation methods.
 -  Examine the processes for device provisioning and auto-provisioning.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe device enrollment, device provisioning, and the attestation mechanisms supported by the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service.
