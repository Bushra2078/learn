It's likely that if you visit a web property for a little while, you'll eventually be prompted to provide some feedback or sign up for something.

 -  Rate the app.
 -  Complete a one-question survey.
 -  Send a smile/frown.
 -  Shake the device to provide feedback.
 -  And various other-exciting ways to engage users for feedback.

It's about meeting your customers where they are, doing well; in-product feedback is a fantastic way to gather impactful, relevant information from people using your product.

Done poorly, it's a lethally effective way to drive people away or irritate them so much that they want to exact their revenge.

## What kind of feedback can you expect?

Feedback from people who are already using your products, who have chosen to visit your website, who has otherwise opted-in to what you are selling, feedback from these people is worth its weight in pixels.

Providing them a way to share feedback with you from within the context of your product makes this type of feedback especially valuable.

It may be used to improve the usability of a particular feature or to recruit users who are already doing specific actions for deeper discussions.

The main value is the immediacy of the feedback given the user’s context within your product.

The feedback will be more concrete, and users may be more likely to provide candid, quick responses.

## Benefits

 -  Context-Sensitive Feedback. Users will already be using your product to provide feedback based on their actual usage or needs at the time. Priceless.
 -  Always on. By implementing feedback mechanisms within the product itself, you have made it easy for users to provide input, at any point, without sending a formal survey or otherwise cluttering an inbox in hopes of getting a hit.
 -  High response rates. Since the feedback mechanism is built into your services, users can access it when they need it. It could mean reporting a problem, bug, enhancement, or glitch or complementing the team on their choice of user experience.

## Weaknesses

 -  Too. Much. Feedback. There are many channels that users can tap into to provide feedback. Sometimes, there are too many to stay on top of them all. After all, it would be a shame to collect feedback from multiple channels and not have the means to review it all.
 -  Not enough detail. If you're posting micro-surveys within your site, the information you get back from respondents may not be sufficiently detailed to allow it to be actionable.
 -  Always on. By implementing feedback mechanisms within the product itself, you have made it easy for users to provide input, at any point, without sending a formal survey or otherwise cluttering an inbox in hopes of getting a hit. But sometimes, that feedback may be irrelevant given new decisions.
 -  Limited future follow-up. Depending on the tools being used, you may not have enough contact information to follow up directly with the person who submitted the feedback and delve deeper into their responses.

Tapping into In-Product feedback is helpful throughout the Product Development Lifecycle. Despite its weaknesses, if done correctly, In-app feedback is an excellent way to validate existing or proposed functionality and ask for ideas for improvements to the status quo. Once the product is in production, use in-app tools to support users, reporting issues, frustrations, improvements, and enhancements.

If you sell a software product, asking for feedback directly inside the app is a fantastic method for collecting product feedback.

It helps you narrow in on specific issues your customers are experiencing. However, it can also feel like the paradox of choice since you can ask ANY question. Here are a few example questions that may be helpful to ask:

“What is \{insert product feature\} helping you accomplish?” “What issues, if any, are you having with \{insert product feature\}?” “What features do you think we're missing today for \{insert product feature\}?”

There are hundreds of in-app questions you can ask. Here's a preview of the pros and cons of in-app surveys.
