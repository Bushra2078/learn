"Measurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to improvement. If you can't measure something, you can't understand it. If you can't understand it, you can't control it. If you can't control it, you can't improve it." ― H. James Harrington.

'User experience' encompasses all aspects of the end-users interaction with the company, its services, and its products. UI (user interface) isn't UX (user experience).

A car with all its looks, dashboard, and steering wheel is the UI. Driving it's the UX. So, the interface directly contributes to the experience (beautiful car interior makes a better experience sit in one) but isn't the experience itself.

The only certain measure of software quality that is worth its salt is end-user satisfaction.

Forget about what applications have been designed to do; forget about developer and service provider promises that don't include an end-user-analytical strategy.

Cut to the chase and look at what is happening; Measuring customer satisfaction doesn't have to be complicated or expensive.

It's simple to incorporate customer satisfaction measurement into your current customer success strategy.

No matter how you cut it, measuring customer satisfaction comes down to gathering customer feedback via surveys. To accurately gauge customer sentiment, we'll need to ask them how their experience was.

There are multiple ways you can execute said the survey, from the survey design to timing, sample, and even how you analyze the data.

Let us briefly cover the five steps to quickly measuring customer satisfaction.

1.  **Outline your goals, and make a plan.** When embarking on any campaign, it's helpful to take back a step and ask, "Why are we doing it?" In business, one must weigh the value of additional information (the customer satisfaction data) about the cost of collecting it (that is, the survey process). If you don't change anything after collecting your customer satisfaction data, you're better off not collecting it. It's going to take time and effort, so you need to put it to use.
    
    Depending on your organizational capabilities, there's a lot you can do with the information.
    
    One use is to wake you up to the reality of any business: A portion of your customers will have an unsatisfactory experience. Every company faces this problem.
    
    When you wake up to that fact, you can choose from many routes to correction. You can:
    
     -  Improve key UX bottlenecks that contribute to poor customer experience.
     -  Promote customer support interactions with the most-frustrated customers.
     -  Operationalize proactive support like a knowledge base and customer education.
     -  Test different live chat scripts and support strategies.
    
    The specific solution isn't necessarily the important part here.
    
    The important part is stepping back and saying, "If we see that a segment of our customers is unsatisfied, what will we do about it?"
2.  **Create a customer satisfaction survey.** What types of metrics measure customer satisfaction? You can choose among a few different options for customer satisfaction surveys. There's no unanimous agreement on which one is best. A few popular methods are:
    
     -  Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
     -  Customer Effort Score (CES)
     -  Net Promoter Score® (NPS)
    
    These are all "one-question" methods that vastly simplify the process of collecting customer insights.
    
    While you may not think the survey methodology matters much, how you ask the question does seem to measure slightly different things.
    
    For instance, a 2010 study found 20 percent of "satisfied" customers said they intended to leave the company in question; 28% of the "dissatisfied" customers intended to stay. So "satisfied" doesn't necessarily equate to "loyal."
    
     -  Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) is the most-used satisfaction method. You ask your customers to rate their satisfaction on a linear scale. Your survey scale can be 1 – 3, 1 – 5, or 1 – 10, and there's no universal agreement on which scale is best to use. CSAT is a metric used to evaluate a customer's specific experience immediately. "CSAT is a transactional metric that is based on what is happening now to a user's satisfaction with a product or service."
     -  Customer Effort Score (CES) is similar, but instead of asking how satisfied the customer was, you ask them to gauge the ease of their experience. You're still-measuring satisfaction, but in this way, you estimate effort (the assumption being that the easier it's to complete a task, the better the experience). As it turns out, making an experience a low effort is one of the most significant ways to reduce frustration and disloyalty.
     -  Net Promoter Score (NPS) asks the question, "How likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague?" It attempts to measure customer satisfaction but also customer loyalty. In doing so, you can come up with an aggregate score, but you can also easily segment your responses into three categories: detractors, passives, and promoters. You calculate your Net Promoter Score by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.
    
    You can use more than one methodology, as well (since they all measure something slightly different). You can optionally combine multiple scores for a more excellent picture:
    
    For example, a customer has had three continuous negative CSAT scores over a period. Also, a detractor on NPS would be an immediate at-risk customer.
    
    In contrast, a customer with positive CSAT and a promoter on NPS are potentially the best source of advocates &amp; candidates to cross-sell/upsell since they already have seen the value in their interactions with the process &amp; product.
    
    Also, I recommend always appending an open-ended qualitative question, despite of the customer satisfaction survey you use.
    
    Without an open-ended question, you risk limiting your insight into "why" the dissatisfaction may be occurring. Qualitative user feedback can give you tons of ideas when it comes to implementing solutions.
3.  **Choose your survey's trigger and timing.** This step is all about who you send the survey to and when you send it. If you go back to your goals outline, it shouldn't be too hard to determine, at least strategically. People tend to forget this step, though, but it's crucial and affects the quality and utility of your data. Tactically, you can trigger a survey much anywhere and to anyone nowadays, but strategically, it matters precisely when and where.
    
    "Although there's no "one size fits all" approach to customer satisfaction surveys, there are three factors that every company should consider before surveying:
    
    What event or action took place before you asked for feedback (it can be time or action-based events like completing your onboarding campaign), the time since your last survey to the customer, and is your team's ability to reply to feedback promptly.
    
    Good examples of event data that can be used to fire a survey are:
    
     -  Time since sign up
     -  Key actions are taken in your app.
     -  Complete user onboarding
     -  Surveying too often will result in low response rates. We recommend a customer satisfaction (NPS) survey seven days after signup, 30 days after the first survey, and every 90 days during the customer lifecycle."
    
    With all the options for triggering, though, let us start with some best practices:
    
     -  The closer the survey is to the experience, the better.
     -  People forget how they feel the longer you wait.
     -  Who you survey changes what insights you get. If your survey website visitors are satisfied, the respondents are anonymous, and maybe a customer--or may not be. It will bring you different data than sending an email to recent customers will. Keep that in mind.
     -  You should survey your customers more than once to see how things change longitudinally. If you operate a SaaS company or a subscription service, regular NPS surveys can help you analyze trends both at the aggregate and individual levels.
     -  Survey people after a critical moment of their customer journey.
     -  If a respondent gives you a high score, think about adding a follow-up ask. For instance, Tinder asks you to rate their app in the app store to provide them with a high score.
4.  **Analyze the survey data.** Once you've collected your data, make sure it doesn't just sit there dormant and unused.
    
    You've got all this customer insight, and it's just waiting to be uncovered!
5.  **Adjust and repeat.** Back to the first point: Now that you have these insights, what will you do about it? Ultimately, it's a personal decision that will reflect your findings and capabilities.
    
    You may find that a whole segment is dissatisfied because of a particular experience.
    
    In that case, you may need to investigate further why that experience (or product) is causing dissatisfaction and run experiments to improve upon it.
    
    You may find that you have a small percentage of super fans.

Now that you can identify these people, perhaps you can work with your customer marketing and customer success teams to plan advocacy programs.

The possibilities are endless, but it all starts with accurately measuring customer satisfaction. But asking for scores is only a part of it--make sure you're creating conditions for customers to leave you high scores, too.
