The large thing that gets missed from feedback surveys is a priority.

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to capture feedback and allow your customers to vote on what is most beneficial to them?

Effective communication on your product roadmap helps keep your customers engaged.

However, by giving your users the ability to request features, you can make them part of your product development inner loop.

It's powerful, but at the same time, you run the risk of driving your product into a direction where it becomes a niche solution only for a subset of the envisaged target market.

By increasing the visibility of the requested features, you can empower your full customer base to vote on features they would like to see most. It helps add a third dimension to the product backlog and aids prioritization.

It's been shown that increased communication with customers promotes more engagement and feedback.

Your customers never feel like they are in the dark by updating supporters of an idea as it moves through different product development stages - from discovery to planning to development and launch.

The Azure DevOps team uses public projects to show its feature plan for the next few months. You can check it out [here](/azure/devops/release-notes/features-timeline).

## Feature request board

A massive part of build a product is identifying new features that customers want. What is the easiest way to figure it out? Ask them!

Creating a "feature request board" is a standard tool for gauging product feedback from existing customers.

Let us see how the integration between Developer Community and Azure DevOps can help you create your feature board for opening the feedback channels with your customers.
