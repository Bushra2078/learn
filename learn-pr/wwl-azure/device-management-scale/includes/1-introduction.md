Most IoT solutions require methods for automating device management tasks that can be applied to groups of devices based on solution parameters.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to manage the IoT devices that have been deployed in the field. Understanding how to automate device management for large numbers of devices will help to ensure that the team is ready to manage thousands of deployed devices. You decide to examine the approaches to device management at scale.

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine how to use IoT Hub jobs for device management.
 -  Examine IoT Hub automatic device management.
 -  Examine device management best practices.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the approaches to device management in bulk.
