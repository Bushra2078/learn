As you deploy infrastructure and solutions in the cloud, you'll need management tools.  Being able to deploy new systems quickly and see if they're functioning optimally gives you a competitive advantage.

At Contoso, you come from a long background of using scripts to deploy your systems and application on-premises.  I'm sure you're wondering if you have similar capabilities in the cloud.  The need to deploy several similarly configured servers at the same time, then deploy your application is a must. Also, since the servers are in the cloud versus in your datacenter, how can you tell they're running once they're deployed.  Tools like PowerShell, resource templates, and Azure Advisor can help with the job.
     
In this module, you will learn about the available tools to help you deploy and manage your cloud deployment.  Then you will experiment with using each of those tools to deploy a server to the cloud, and verify it is functioning.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to explain what management tools are available in Azure and what they're used for.
