Not all staff members within an organization will be receptive to the change required for a DevOps transformation.

In discussions around continuous delivery, we usually categorize users into three general buckets:

 -  **Canary** users voluntarily test bleeding edge features as soon as they're available.
 -  **Early adopters** who voluntarily preview releases, considered more refined than the code that exposes canary users.
 -  **Users** who consume the products after passing through canary and early adopters.

It's essential to find staff members keen to see new features as soon as they're available when choosing Canary. Also, it's highly tolerant of issues that might arise.

Early adopters have similar characteristics to the Canaries. They've often work requirements that make them less tolerant to issues and interruptions to their ability to work.

While development and IT operations staff might generally be less conservative than users.

The staff will also range from traditional to early adopters, and others happy to work at the innovative edge.

## Ideal target improvements

It's also important to roll out changes incrementally. There's an old saying in the industry that any successful large IT system was previously a successful small IT system.

Large-scale systems that are rolled out all at once have an abysmal record of success. Most fail, no matter how much support management has provided.

When starting, it's essential to find an improvement goal that:

 -  It can be used to gain early wins.
 -  It's small enough to be achievable in a reasonable timeframe.
 -  Has benefits that are significant enough to be evident to the organization.

It allows constant learning from rapid feedback and the ability to recover from mistakes quickly.
