Managing access to resources in Azure is a critical part of an organizationâ€™s security and compliance requirements. Role-based access control (RBAC) is the capability for you to grant appropriate access to Azure AD users, groups, and services. Azure Role-based access control is configured by selecting a role (the definition of what actions are allowed and/or denied), then associating the role with a user, group, or service principal. Finally, this combination of role and user/group/service principal is scoped to either the entire subscription, a resource group, or specific resources within a resource group.

The Azure subscription is shown with 2 resource groups containing resources. On the right side are sets of roles (owner, contributor, and reader) with an arrow going downwards showing that access to resources is inherited all the way down from the subscription level.":::
