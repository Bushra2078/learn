There is no task more fundamental to creating object oriented programs than creating a class. Classes are the building blocks of all object-oriented applications. Indeed, they put the “object” in the term *object*-oriented. Understanding how to create and use them is an essential skill for all developers writing object-oriented code.

Suppose you're writing a simple program that displays information about cars for sale. You need to create an application that can hold information about each car. That sounds like a car class doesn’t it? What information should this car class hold? Things like make, model, year, and price sound like a good place to start.

In this module, you're being asked to create an application that can take in, and display, information as properties on a car class. Your car class should also have a method for displaying all of the information on a given car. Good luck!
