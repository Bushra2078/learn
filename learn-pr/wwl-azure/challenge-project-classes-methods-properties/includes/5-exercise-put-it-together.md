## Create a new car object and set its information

Create a new instance of the Car class, setting its initial values (make, model, year, and price) in the constructor.

## Display the car's information

Call the method you created on the Car object for displaying its information.

## Test the program

Run the program and you should see the output, for example, "Make: Honda, Model: Civic, Year: 2022, Price: $20,000" displayed in the console.

Congratulations, you have now created a program that demonstrates classes, methods, and properties using the concept of a car and its attributes!
