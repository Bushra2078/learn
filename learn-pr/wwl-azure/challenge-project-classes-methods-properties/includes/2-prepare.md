## Prepare

You are using the .NET Editor as your code development environment. You're developing an application that demonstrates a few of the topics you have learned in this course. Specifically, how to create a class that has a constructor for initializing an object. How to create and use methods. And how to create and use properties. The console application you create should have two .cs files, Program.cs and Car.cs. Your Program class should instantiate your Car class. Your car class needs a constructor, properties to get and set the values it holds, and a method for printing the values of a car to the screen.

## Project overview

You'll be building a basic application that can, for example, be used for selling cars. The application should consist of two files, Program.cs and Cars.cs. Your Program.cs file instantiates your Car class where you pass in information about the cars it holds through the constructor. You create a couple of car objects in your Program class and then print the data in each car object using a method you create. These tasks are the basic requirements of your application. As your car object has properties that allow you to change individual car values, and retrieve them, you can try different ways of setting and getting values in and out of your car object, as well as printing them.


## Setup

I'm not sure if I need any setup.
