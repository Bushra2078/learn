Azure virtual networks are a fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. Azure virtual networks enable many types of Azure resources to securely communicate. The resources can communicate with each other. the internet, and on-premises networks. VNet is similar to a traditional network, but has more benefits such as scale, availability, and isolation.

Azure IP addressing is critical to ensuring resources are accessible. Private IP addresses to communicate between resources in Azure. Public IP addresses enable Azure resources to be accessible directly from the internet.

You should now be able to:

 -  Identify features and usage cases for subnets and subnetting.
 -  Create a virtual network with subnetting.
 -  Identify usage cases for private and public IP addresses.
 -  Create and determine which resources require public and private IP addresses.
