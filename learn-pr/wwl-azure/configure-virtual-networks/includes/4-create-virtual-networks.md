You can create new virtual networks at any time. You can also add virtual networks when you create a virtual machine. Either way you will need to define the address space, and at least one subnet. By default, you can create up to 50 virtual networks per subscription per region. You can increase this limit to 500 by contacting Azure support.

> [!NOTE]
> Default limits on Azure networking resources can change periodically so it's a good idea to consult the documentation for the latest information.

> Plan to use an address space that is not already in use in your organization, either on-premises or in the cloud. Even if you plan for cloud-only virtual networks, you may later decide to connect an on-premises site.
