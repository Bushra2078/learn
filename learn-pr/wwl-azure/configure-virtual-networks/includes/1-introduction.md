Virtual networks are a fundamental component of private networks that enable resources to communicate securely. Communication can happen between resources, over the internet, and with on-premises networks. In this module, we explore how Azure Virtual Network can support your configuration.

Suppose your company is migrating to Azure. They want to replicate their on-premises network in the cloud. Their Azure resources need to be organized into virtual networks and subnets, and implement a customized IP addressing schema for the company. 

You're responsible for configuring the virtual networks and subnets, including IP addressing. The company schema should provide flexibility, room for growth, and integration with on-premises networks. The schema should also minimize public exposure of systems, and give the organization flexibility in its network design. If your network configuration isn't properly designed, systems might not be able to communicate.
