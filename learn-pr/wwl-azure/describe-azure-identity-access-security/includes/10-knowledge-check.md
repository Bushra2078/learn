## Multiple Choice
Which Azure Active Directory tool can vary the credentials needed to log in based on signals, such as where the user is located?
( ) Multifactor authentication {{Multifactor authentication (MFA) is an authentication method, but not a tool to determine which authentication methods to use. Conditional access, however, may choose to require multifactor authentication based on signals received.}}
(x) Conditional Access {{Conditional Access is a tool that Azure Active Directory uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. Conditional Access might challenge you for a second authentication factor if your sign-in signals are unusual or from an unexpected location.}}
( ) Guest access {{Guest access is an access method that helps enable collaboration across organizational boundaries, but isn’t an authentication method or a tool to help with authentication.}}
( ) Passwordless {{Passwordless is an authentication method that relies on something you have; plus something you are or something you know. For example, Windows Hello is a passwordless authentication method.}}

## Multiple Choice
Which security model assumes the worst-case security scenario, and protects resources accordingly?
(x) Zero trust {{Zero Trust is a security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation.}}
( ) Defense-in-depth {{Defense-in-depth is focused on setting up a system that prevents access to information by unauthorized parties. It’s a proactive model and builds layer upon layer to protect information.}}
( ) Role-based access control {{Role-based access control provides the ability to grant or deny access based on a user or services assigned role.}}
( ) Disaster recovery {{Disaster recovery is a concept focused on getting running again after a catastrophic failure.}}

## Multiple Choice
You’re simultaneously assigned multiple roles that use role-based access control. The role permissions are: Role 1) Read only. Role 2) Read and write. Role 3) Read and delete.
( ) Read only {{Role-based access control works on an allow model, so you’d wouldn’t be limited to the permissions of only one role.}}
( ) Read and write {{Role-based access control works on an allow model, so you’d wouldn’t be limited to the permissions of only one role.}}
( ) Read and delete {{Role-based access control works on an allow model, so you’d wouldn’t be limited to the permissions of only one role.}}
( ) Read, write, and delete {{Role-based access control, using an allow model, grants all of the permissions assigned in all of the assigned roles.}}
