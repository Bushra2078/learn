  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is required for a function to run?"
    choices:
    - content: "Binding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Bindings connect resources to a function, but are not required for a function to run."
    - content: "Trigger"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Both triggers and bindings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Only a trigger is required for a function to run."

    choices:
    - content: "Bindings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Input and output bindings use `in` and `out`."
    - content: "Trigger"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Triggers only support the `in` direction."
    - content: "Connection value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A connection value is used to connect your function to other Azure services."
