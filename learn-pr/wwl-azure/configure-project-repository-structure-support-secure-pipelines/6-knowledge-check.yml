quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "How can you ensure that any issues or security breaches that occur in one project do not affect other projects?"
    choices:
    - content: "By restricting access to projects to specific users or groups, thus ensuring that only specific users or groups are able to view and modify the project resources where they are authorized."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Setting separate permissions to each project helps you to keep control of who can access project resources and not let a breach in one project to affect other projects."
    - content: "By exporting the data in the compromised project to a new project and then deleting the compromised project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exporting the data of a compromised project into a new project does not guarantee that other projects won't be affected. Also, deleting the compromised project after a breach has taken place won't prevent a possible security impact on other projects."
    - content: "By setting up a rule that locks access to all projects if a security breach is detected."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It is not possible to set up a rule that locks access to all projects if a security breach is detected."
  - content: "Which of the following statements is true about secure files?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can separate secure files between different team projects to reduce the risk of sensitive data being accidentally exposed or leaked."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Adding project secure files to different team projects makes it easier to manage access and ensure confidentiality."
    - content: "You can replace secure files but not delete them."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Once you upload a secure file, you can delete it but not replace it."
    - content: "You cannot add permissions for individual secure files in a pipeline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It is possible to add permissions for an individual file. To do so, go to the file's edit view, select Pipeline permissions to set per-pipeline permissions, or select Security to set security roles."
  - content: "In which of the following cases is it advisable to create multiple repositories within a single project?"
    choices:
    - content: "If the products or services are working on a coordinated release schedule."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "One project containing multiple repos works well to ensure the processes of products or services working on a coordinated release schedule remain shared and consistent."
    - content: "If the products or services work on independent schedules or processes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If the products or services work on independent schedules or processes, it is best to split them into multiple projects."
    - content: "If coordinated code changes across the repos are expected to be made."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No tools can help coordinate code changes across repos."
  - content: "Which would be a better Azure DevOps structure if a company wants to give its teams visibility into each other's work so they can stay aligned?"
    choices:
    - content: "One organization with one project and many teams."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "One organization for the entire company and one single project with many teams is best for companies with highly aligned teams so they can use the same taxonomy for work item tracking, making it easier to communicate and stay consistent."
    - content: "One organization with many projects and teams."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although good reporting is possible across projects, cross-project roll-up and team coordination is more difficult, so it is best when different efforts require different processes."
    - content: "A separate organization for each team."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Separate organizations don't allow good collaboration, coordination, and visibility between them, so they are only a good option for teams that work in isolation."
  - content: "A user who lacks Contribute permission is introducing code to a repository. Which is the most likely cause?"
    choices:
    - content: "The user has Create Branch permission at the repository level."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A user with Create Branch permission at the repository level can introduce code to the repo through a new branch even if they lack Contribute permission."
    - content: "The user has enabled automatic fork builds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A user who lacks Contribute permission cannot enable automatic fork builds in a repo."
    - content: "The user has been assigned as code owner to a path in the repository."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It is not possible for a user with no Contribute permission to be assigned as code owner to any paths in a repository."
