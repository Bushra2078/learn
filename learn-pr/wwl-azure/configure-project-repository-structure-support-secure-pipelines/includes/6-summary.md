Our banking institution needed to set up a secure project and repository structure in Azure DevOps that will allow each development team to work independently while ensuring their code is secure and meets all compliance and banking regulations. We created a secure project and repository structure in Azure DevOps with organizations, projects, teams, and repositories, and used them to organize the work of each development team. We were able to separate a project into team projects, create multiple repositories in a project, move the security repository away from a project, separate secure files, and set project and repository permissions.

Without a well-organized project and repository structure, it would be difficult to have visibility, collaborate, and manage the work of several development teams working on different projects and applications. Also, without a secure project and repository structure, code and secure files could be subject to malicious or unintentional changes from unauthorized users. A secure pipeline would not be possible, nor would cybersecurity and banking regulations be met. Configuring an organized project and repository structure in Azure DevOps makes it possible to secure pipelines and protect code and data from ending in the wrong hands.
