In this module, you learned about the most common Azure Stack HCI management tasks and how to perform these tasks by using Windows Admin Center. 

Using what you have learned, you determined that you can improve Contoso's operational model by combining the capabilities of Azure Stack HCI, Windows Admin Center, and Azure hybrid services. In particular:

- Windows Admin Center simplifies implementation of the most common Azure Stack HCI management tasks.
- Cluster-Aware Updating (CAU) automates patching of Azure Stack HCI cluster nodes while maintaining clustered workloads online.
- Windows Admin Center and Azure Monitor provide comprehensive monitoring of Azure Stack HCI and its workloads.
- Azure cloud witness increases resiliency of Azure Stack HCI clusters.
- Azure Stack HCI stretched clusters facilitate implementing a disaster recovery environment.
- Windows Admin Center and Windows PowerShell help with adding and removing nodes of Azure Stack HCI clusters.
- Windows Admin Center guides you through the node maintenance procedure with minimal impact on cluster resiliency and performance.
- Windows Admin Center assists with configuring CredSSP authentication.
