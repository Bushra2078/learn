While there are some simple scripts that use only simple Windows PowerShell commands, most scripts use scripting constructs to perform more complex actions. You can use the **ForEach** construct to process all of the objects in an array. You can use **If..Else** and **Switch** constructs to make decisions in your scripts. Finally, there are less common looping constructs such as **For**, **While**, and **Do..While** loops that can be used when appropriate. In this module, you'll learn how to use scripting constructs.

##Learning objectives
