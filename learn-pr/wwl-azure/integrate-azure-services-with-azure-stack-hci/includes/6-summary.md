In this module, you learned how to integrate Azure Stack HCI with the most common Azure hybrid services, including Azure Monitor, Azure Site Recovery, Azure Backup, and Azure Network Adapter.

Using what you have learned, you determined that you can deliver meaningful benefits to Contoso's operational model by combining the capabilities of Azure Stack HCI and Azure hybrid services. You learned that:

- Azure Monitor provides additional visibility into performance and availability of Azure Stack HCI cluster and its workloads.
- Azure Site Recovery enhances built-in resiliency of Azure Stack HCI by providing a cost-efficient method to implement a disaster recovery environment in Azure.
- Azure Backup can minimize the need for backup tapes and deliver enterprise-level data protection features by storing backups of Azure Stack HCI workloads in Azure.
- Azure Network Adapter can simplify the process of establishing P2S VPN connectivity between Azure Stack HCI workloads and Azure virtual networks.
