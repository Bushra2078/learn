Start your database security process by configuring a SQL Database firewall.

Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics, previously SQL Data Warehouse, (both referred to as SQL Database in this lesson) provide a relational database service for Azure and other internet-based applications. To help protect your data, firewalls prevent all access to your database server until you specify which computers have permission. The firewall grants access to databases based on the originating IP address of each request.

In addition to IP rules, the firewall also manages virtual network rules. Virtual network rules are based on virtual network service endpoints. Virtual network rules might be preferable to IP rules in some cases.

## Overview

Initially, all access to your Azure SQL Database is blocked by the SQL Database firewall. To access a database server, you must specify one or more server-level IP firewall rules that enable access to your Azure SQL Database. Use the IP firewall rules to specify which IP address ranges from the internet are allowed, and whether Azure applications can attempt to connect to your Azure SQL Database.

To selectively grant access to just one of the databases in your Azure SQL Database, you must create a database-level rule for the required database. Specify an IP address range for the database IP firewall rule that is beyond the IP address range specified in the server-level IP firewall rule, and ensure that the IP address of the client falls in the range specified in the database-level rule.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Synapse Analytics only supports server-level IP firewall rules, and not database-level IP firewall rules.

### Connecting from the internet

When a computer attempts to connect to your database server from the internet, the firewall first checks the originating IP address of the request against the database-level IP firewall rules for the database that the connection is requesting:

 -  If the IP address of the request is within one of the ranges specified in the database-level IP firewall rules, the connection is granted to the SQL Database containing the rule.
 -  If the IP address of the request is not within one of the ranges specified in the database-level IP firewall rules, the firewall checks the server-level IP firewall rules. If the IP address of the request is within one of the ranges specified in the server-level IP firewall rules, the connection is granted. Server-level IP firewall rules apply to all SQL databases on the Azure SQL Database.
 -  If the IP address of the request is not within the ranges specified in any of the database-level or server-level IP firewall rules, the connection request fails.

### Connecting from Azure

To allow applications from Azure to connect to your Azure SQL Database, Azure connections must be enabled. When an application from Azure attempts to connect to your database server, the firewall verifies that Azure connections are allowed. A firewall setting with starting and ending addresses equal to 0.0.0.0 indicates Azure connections are allowed. If the connection attempt is not allowed, the request does not reach the Azure SQL Database server.

This option configures the firewall to allow all connections from Azure including connections from the subscriptions of other customers. When selecting this option, make sure your sign-in and user permissions limit access to authorized users only.

### Server-level IP firewall rules

Server-level IP firewall rules enable clients to access your entire Azure SQL Databaseâ€”that is, all the databases within the same SQL Database server. These rules are stored in the master database.

You can configure server-level IP firewall rules using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or by using Transact-SQL statements. To create server-level IP firewall rules using the Azure portal or PowerShell, you must be the subscription owner or a subscription contributor. To create a server-level IP firewall rule using Transact-SQL, you must connect to the SQL Database instance as the server-level principal login or the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) administrator (which means that a server-level IP firewall rule must have first been created by a user with Azure-level permissions).

### Database-level IP firewall rules

Database-level IP firewall rules enable clients to access certain secure databases within the same SQL Database server. You can create these rules for each database (including the master database), and they are stored in the individual databases. You can only create and manage database-level IP firewall rules for master databases and user databases by using Transact-SQL statements, and only after you have configured the first server-level firewall. If you specify an IP address range in the database-level IP firewall rule that is outside the range specified in the server-level IP firewall rule, only those clients that have IP addresses in the database-level range can access the database. You can have a maximum of 128 database-level IP firewall rules for a database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Whenever possible, as a best practice, use database-level IP firewall rules to enhance security and to make your database more portable. Use server-level IP firewall rules for administrators and when you have several databases with the same access requirements, and you don't want to spend time configuring each database individually.
