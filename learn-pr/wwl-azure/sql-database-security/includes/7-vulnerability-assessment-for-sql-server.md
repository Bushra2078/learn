**What is SQL vulnerability assessment?** SQL vulnerability assessment is a service that provides visibility into your security state. Vulnerability assessment includes actionable steps to resolve security issues and enhance your database security. It can help you to monitor a dynamic database environment where changes are difficult to track and improve your SQL security posture.<br>

Vulnerability assessment is a scanning service built into Azure SQL Database. The service employs a knowledge base of rules that flag security vulnerabilities. It highlights deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data.

The rules are based on Microsoft's best practices and focus on the security issues that present the biggest risks to your database and its valuable data. They cover database-level issues and server-level security issues, like server firewall settings and server-level permissions.

The results of the scan include actionable steps to resolve each issue and provide customized remediation scripts where applicable. You can customize an assessment report for your environment by setting an acceptable baseline for:

 -  Permission configurations
 -  Feature configurations
 -  Database settings

SQL vulnerability assessment is an easy-to-configure service that can **discover**, **track**, and help you **remediate** potential database vulnerabilities. Use it to **proactively improve your database security** for:

 -  Azure SQL Database
 -  Azure SQL Managed Instance
 -  Azure Synapse Analytics
