Azure Defender for SQL (formerly known as Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)) for single and pooled databases detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases. Advanced Threat Protection can identify **Potential SQL injection**, **Access from unusual location or data center, Access from unfamiliar principal or potentially harmful application**, and **Brute force SQL credentials**.

Azure Defender for SQL is part of the advanced data security (ADS) offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Advanced Threat Protection can be accessed and managed via the central SQL ADS portal.
ATP provides a new layer of security, which enables customers to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur by providing security alerts on anomalous activities. 

### Azure Defender for SQL alerts
Advanced Threat Protection for Azure SQL Database detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases and it can trigger the following alerts:
* **Vulnerability to SQL injection**: This alert is triggered when an application generates a faulty SQL statement in the database. This alert may indicate a possible vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. There are two possible reasons for the generation of a faulty statement:

     - A defect in application code that constructs the faulty SQL statement
     - Application code or stored procedures don't sanitize user input when constructing the faulty SQL statement, which may be exploited for SQL Injection
* **Potential SQL injection**: This alert is triggered when an active exploit happens against an identified application vulnerability to SQL injection. This means the attacker is trying to inject malicious SQL statements using the vulnerable application code or stored procedures.

* **Access from unusual location**: This alert is triggered when there is a change in the access pattern to SQL server, where someone has logged on to the SQL server from an unusual geographical location. In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (a new application or developer maintenance). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (former employee, external attacker).

* **Access from unusual Azure data center**: This alert is triggered when there is a change in the access pattern to SQL server, where someone has logged on to the SQL server from an unusual Azure data center that was seen on this server during the recent period. In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (your new application in Azure, Power BI, Azure SQL Query Editor). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action from an Azure resource/service (former employee, external attacker).

* **Access from unfamiliar principal**: This alert is triggered when there is a change in the access pattern to SQL server, where someone has logged on to the SQL server using an unusual principal (SQL user). In some cases, the alert detects a legitimate action (new application, developer maintenance). In other cases, the alert detects a malicious action (former employee, external attacker).

* **Access from a potentially harmful application**: This alert is triggered when a potentially harmful application is used to access the database. In some cases, the alert detects penetration testing in action. In other cases, the alert detects an attack using common attack tools.

* **Brute force SQL credentials**: This alert is triggered when there is an abnormal high number of failed logins with different credentials. In some cases, the alert detects penetration testing in action. In other cases, the alert detects brute force attack.

ATP is integrated with Azure Security Center to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur.
