What are the SQL vulnerability assessments express and classic configurations?

You can configure vulnerability assessment for your SQL databases with either:

 -  Express configuration (preview) – The default procedure that lets you configure vulnerability assessment without dependency on external storage to store baseline and scan result data.<br>
 -  Classic configuration – The legacy procedure that requires you to manage an Azure storage account to store baseline and scan result data.<br>

**Configuration modes benefits and limitations comparison:**
