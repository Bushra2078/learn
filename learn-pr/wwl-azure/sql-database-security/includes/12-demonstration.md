Give these Try-This exercises a test to gain some experience using Azure.

    These demonstrations requires an Azure SQL database with sample data. In Task 1, there are instructions to install the AdventureWorks sample database. Also, Task 3 requires SQL Server Management Studio. 

## Task 1 - Azure SQL: Advanced Data Security and Auditing

In this task, we will explore vulnerability assessments, data dicscovery and classification, and audting.

1. You can drill into any graphic for additional details.

## Task 3 - Azure SQL: AAD Authentication

    This task requires an Azure SQL database that has not had AAD configured. This task also requires SQL Server Management Studio. 

In this task, we will configure Azure AD authentication. 

1. In the **Portal**.
