SQL Vulnerability Assessment is an easy-to-configure service that can discover, track, and help you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. Use it to proactively improve your database security.

Vulnerability Assessment is part of the **Advanced Data Security** offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Vulnerability Assessment can be accessed and managed via the central SQL Advanced Data Security portal.

## Vulnerability Assessment

SQL Vulnerability Assessment is a service that provides visibility into your security state. Vulnerability Assessment includes actionable steps to resolve security issues and enhance your database security. It can help you:

 -  Meet compliance requirements that require database scan reports.
 -  Meet data privacy standards.
 -  Monitor a dynamic database environment where changes are difficult to track.

Vulnerability Assessment is a **scanning service built into Azure SQL Database**. The service employs a knowledge base of rules that flag security vulnerabilities. It highlights deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data.

The rules are based on Microsoft's best practices and focus on the security issues that present the biggest risks to your database and its valuable data. They cover database-level issues and server-level security issues, like server firewall settings and server-level permissions. These rules also represent many of the requirements from various regulatory bodies to meet their compliance standards.

Results of the scan include actionable steps to resolve each issue and provide customized remediation scripts where applicable. You can customize an assessment report for your environment by setting an acceptable baseline for:

 -  Permission configurations.
 -  Feature configurations.
 -  Database settings.

## View the report

When your scan is finished, your scan report is automatically displayed in the Azure portal. The report presents an overview of your security state. It lists how many issues were found and their respective severities. Results include warnings on deviations from best practices and a snapshot of your security-related settings, such as database principals and roles and their associated permissions. The scan report also provides a map of sensitive data discovered in your database. It includes recommendations to classify that data by using data discovery and classification. Scan results shown below:

## Set your baseline

As you review your assessment results, you can mark specific results as being an acceptable baseline in your environment. The baseline is essentially a customization of how the results are reported. Results that match the baseline are considered as passing in subsequent scans. After you've established your baseline security state, Vulnerability Assessment only reports on deviations from the baseline. In this way, you can focus your attention on the relevant issues.
