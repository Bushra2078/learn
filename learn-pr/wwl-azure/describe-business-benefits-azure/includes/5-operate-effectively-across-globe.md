With Microsoft Azure, you gain access to a global computing network with over 200 datacenters located in 61 regions around the world. The worldwide reach of the cloud can improve your business in two key ways:

## Connecting Worldwide

Azure can improve the quality of your business’s digital services to worldwide customers and employees. Since Azure's cloud technology is distributed around the world, people across the globe can connect to your digital services faster via datacenters nearer to them. Your business can even choose to specifically invest in cloud assets located near your customers and worksites. Your workforce will be able to collaborate more reliably, and your customers will enjoy better service. And if you don’t yet have a worldwide presence, the cloud might help change that!

## Legal Compliance

Another benefit of Azure’s global reach is that it enables you to easily comply with place-based digital regulations. For example, if you do business in the European Union (EU), then you can arrange to have European customers’ cloud data stored at a datacenter in Europe that complies with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Your other customers’ data can be stored elsewhere, compliant with other regulations as needed. Once set up, you won’t need to monitor those services for compliance as closely as you would under your own IT system, saving you money.

Azure has compliance offerings available for specific countries, regions, and industries. [For more information about legal compliance, check out this resource](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/compliance/regional-country-compliance).
