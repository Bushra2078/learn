The **Service Trust Portal** (STP) hosts the Compliance Manager service, and is the Microsoft public site for publishing audit reports and other compliance-related information relevant to Microsoftâ€™s cloud services. Service Trust Portal users can download audit reports produced by external auditors and gain insight from Microsoft-authored reports that provide details on how Microsoft builds and operates its cloud services.

Service Trust Portal (STP) also includes information about how Microsoft online services can help your organization maintain and track compliance with standards, laws, and regulations, such as:

- ISO
- SOC
- NIST
- FedRAMP
