  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following characteristics is indicative of user-assigned identities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Shared lifecycle with an Azure resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. User-assigned identities have an independent lifecycle from the resources they're associated with."
    - content: "Independent life-cycle"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. User-assigned identities exist independently from the resources they're associated with and must be explicitly deleted."
    - content: "Can only be associated with a single Azure resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The same user-assigned managed identity can be associated with more than one Azure resource."
  - content: "A client app requests managed identities for an access token for a given resource. Which of the below is the basis for the token?"
    choices:
    - content: "Oauth 2.0"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Oauth 2.0 is a protocol that can be used to acquire a token, but isn't the basis for the token."
    - content: "Service principal"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The token is based on the managed identities for Azure resources service principal."
    - content: "Virtual machine"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The virtual machine may be assigned a managed identity, but isn't the basis for the token."
