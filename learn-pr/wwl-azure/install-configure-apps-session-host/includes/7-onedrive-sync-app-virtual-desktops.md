OneDrive for Business is not supported in non-persistent RDSH or VDI environments without FSLogix profile containers.

## Install the OneDrive sync app per machine

By default, the OneDrive sync app installs per user, meaning OneDrive.exe needs to be installed for each user account on the PC under the `%localappdata%` folder. With the new per-machine installation option, you can install OneDrive under the **Program Files (x86)** or **Program Files** directory, meaning all profiles on the computer will use the same **OneDrive.exe** binary. Other than where the sync app is installed, the behavior is the same.

The new per-machine sync app provides:

 -  Automatic transitioning from the previous OneDrive for Business sync app (Groove.exe).
 -  Automatic conversion from per-user to per-machine.
 -  Automatic updates when a new version is available.

The per-machine sync app supports syncing OneDrive files for Microsoft 365 and SharePoint Server 2019.

## Deployment instructions

1.  Download **OneDriveSetup.exe**.
2.  Run `OneDriveSetup.exe /allusers` from a command prompt window or by using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. This will install the sync app under the `Program Files (x86)\Microsoft OneDrive` directory. When setup completes, OneDrive will start. If accounts were added on the computer, they'll be migrated automatically.
