You'll be using Visual Studio to develop a Langston's Ant project. 

## Project overview

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned about interfaces to abstract the Ant's behavior. Afterwards, you'll implement the new interface and create a new type of Ant as well.

## Setup

Use the following steps to prepare for the Guided Project exercises:

1. To download a zip file containing the Starter project code, select the following link: [Lab Files](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Challenge-project-Create-methods-in-CSharp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

1. Unzip the download files.

    Unzip the files in your development environment. Consider using your PC as your development environment so that you have access to your code after completing this module. If you aren't using your PC as your development environment, you can unzip the files in a sandbox or hosted environment.

    1. On your local machine, navigate to your downloads folder.
    1. Right-click **Guided-project-Langstons-Ant.main.zip**, and then select **Extract all**.
    1. Select **Show extracted files when complete**, and then select **Extract**.
    1. Make note of the extracted folder location.

1. Copy the extracted **LangstonsAnt** folder to your Windows Desktop folder.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a folder named **LangstonsAnt** already exists, you can select **Replace the files in the destination** to complete the copy operation.

1. Open the new **LangstonsAnt** folder in Visual Studio.

    1. Open Visual Studio in your development environment.
    1. In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.
    1. Navigate to the Windows Desktop folder and locate the "ChallengeProject" folder.
    1. Select **ChallengeProject** and then select **Select Folder**.

        The Visual Studio Code EXPLORER view should show the **ChallengeProject** folder and two sub-folders named **Final** and **Starter**.

You're now ready to begin the Guided Project exercises. Good luck!
