Let us look at using open-source software in building software.

## Using open-source software

Packages contain components that are built from source code. Open-source code is publicly available for inspection, reuse, and contribution.

Most commonly, open-source projects indicate how the sources can be used and distributed afterward. A license agreement comes with the source code and specifies what can and cannot be done.

Software today is built by using components. These components are created in part by the team that is writing the entire software solution.

Some dependencies are on components created and made available by other teams, third-party companies, and the community. The packages that contain the components are a formalized way for distribution.

On average, the built software solution is around 80% based on existing components and maintained outside of the project.

The rest of the solution consists of your code with business logic and specifics for the functional requirements. Plus, "glue" code that binds the components and your code. The components can be a commercial offering or free of charge.

A considerable part of the publically available and free components are community efforts to offer reusable components for everyone to use and build software. The persons creating and maintaining these components often also make the source code available.

It's open-source code as opposed to closed source. A closed source means that the source code isn't available, even though components are available.
