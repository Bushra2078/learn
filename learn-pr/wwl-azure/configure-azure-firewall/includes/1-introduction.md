Companies need to protect their data and resources against malicious attacks. Azure Firewall helps to secure an Azure Virtual Network implementation for allowed traffic and deny threatening or unknown traffic from the internet. 

Suppose your company has offices and resources distributed across multiple Azure regions. Your networking infrastructure includes multiple virtual networks and connections to an on-premises network. The IT staff is concerned about malicious actors trying to infiltrate your network.

You're responsible for implementing Azure Firewall to protect company resources. You need to configure Azure Firewall to deny incoming and outgoing threats while also allowing legitimate traffic.
