## Installing the test agent

To execute tests from within the pipeline, you need an agent that can run these tests.

An agent can run on another machine and can be installed as part of the pipeline.

For more information, see [Run Your Tests](/azure/devops/pipelines/test/set-up-continuous-test-environments-builds).

## Running in the cloud

Hosted agents run the test agent, which enables you to run tests "in the cloud."

For Load Testing, you can also run from the cloud. It enables you to create a large set of users and test your application without setting up your infrastructure.

See [Changes to load test functionality in Visual Studio and cloud load testing in Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/test/load-test/overview) for more information.
