Logs contain different kinds of data organized into records with different sets of properties for each type. Telemetry such as events and traces are stored as logs in addition to performance data so that it can all be combined for analysis."

Metrics are numerical values collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a system at a particular time. Metrics in Azure Monitor are lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time scenarios, so they're useful for alerting and fast detection of issues. You can analyze them interactively by using Metrics Explorer, be proactively notified with an alert when a value crosses a threshold, or visualize them in a workbook or dashboard."
