The underlying network components in your on-premises infrastructure are critical to connectivity to both on-premises server resources, and to those you host in Azure. It’s therefore vital that you know how to troubleshoot on-premises connectivity and hybrid network connectivity. Fundamental issues that relate to Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS), and basic IP configuration can cause reliability and connectivity problems. In this module, you’ll learn how to diagnose hybrid IP addressing, name resolution, and routing problems.

In this module, you will:

- Troubleshoot on-premises connectivity and hybrid network connectivity.

- Diagnose hybrid IP addressing, name resolution, and routing problems.

## Learning objectives

- Diagnose DHCP and DNS problems in on-premises contexts.

- Diagnose IP configuration and routing problems.

- Implement Packet Monitor to help diagnose network problems.

- Use Azure Network Watcher to troubleshoot Microsoft Azure virtual networks.

## Prerequisites
