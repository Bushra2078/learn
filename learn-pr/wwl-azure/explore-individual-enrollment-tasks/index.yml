title: Explore individual enrollment tasks
summary: Experience implementing an individual enrollment using symmetric keys, using code that accesses device twin properties to initialize a device, and a deprovisioning process that disenrolls and deregisters a device.
abstract: |
  After you complete this module, you will be able to:
  - Create a new individual enrollment in DPS that uses Symmetric Key attestation and specifies an initial Device Twin State for the device.
  - Configure a simulated device using the autogenerated keys for device attestation, verify that device connects successfully with IoT hub, and recognize the code used to initialize the device using device twin properties.
  - Complete a deprovisioning process that securely removes the device from your solution by both disenrolling and deregistering the device.
prerequisites: |
  Ability to:
  *   Demonstrate a general understanding of cloud-based solutions, Azure, and Azure services.
  *   Describe the Azure IoT SDKs for devices and services, and how Visual Studio Code, Azure CLI, and the Azure Cloud Shell can be used to configure and develop components of an IoT solution.
  *   Describe the phases of device provisioning, the concept of device enrollment and attestation, the high-level processes for device provisioning, and the tools used by developers to implement DPS tasks.
