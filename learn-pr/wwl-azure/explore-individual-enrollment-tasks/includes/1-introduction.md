The Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service supports both device provisioning and deprovisioning of individual devices using various attestation mechanisms.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company will be provisioning thousands of devices using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. You decide to gain experience using the Device Provisioning Service by implementing an individual enrollment and disenrollment for a device in a test environment.

In this module, you will complete the following lab activities:

 -  Create a new individual enrollment in DPS that uses Symmetric Key attestation and specifies an initial Device Twin State (telemetry rate) for the device.
 -  Configure a simulated device using the autogenerated keys for device attestation and verify that device connects successfully with IoT hub, and then examine the code used to initialize the device using device twin properties.
 -  Complete a deprovisioning process that securely removes the device from your solution by both disenrolling and deregistering the device (from DPS and IoT hub respectively).

By the end of this module, you will be able to provision and deprovision devices using an individual enrollment process.
