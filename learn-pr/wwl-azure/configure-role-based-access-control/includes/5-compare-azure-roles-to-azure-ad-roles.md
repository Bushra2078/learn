Three types of roles are available for access management in Azure:

- Classic subscription administrator roles

- Azure role-based access control (RBAC) roles

- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) administrator roles

To better understand how these different roles are defined and implemented in Azure, it helps to know some of the history.

When Azure was initially released, access to resources was managed with just three administrator roles: _Account Administrator_, _Service Administrator_, and _Co-Administrator_. Access was controlled by assigning admin roles to subscriptions.

Later, role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure resources was added. Azure RBAC is a newer authorization system that provides fine-grained access management to Azure resources. RBAC includes many built-in roles that can be assigned at different scopes. The Azure RBAC model also lets you create your own custom roles.

In addition to Classic subscription admin roles and Azure RBAC roles, Azure AD provides built-in administrator roles to manage Azure AD resources like users, groups, and domains.

> [!Tip]
> If you're considering using Classic administrator roles, use Azure Resource Manager roles instead.

The following table highlights differences between Azure RBAC roles and Azure AD administrator roles.

| <!-- Blank --> | Azure&nbsp;RBAC&nbsp;roles | Azure&nbsp;AD&nbsp;admin&nbsp;roles |
| --- | --- | --- |

| **Scope&nbsp;assignment**  | Scope can be specified at multiple levels, including management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources | Scope is specified at the tenant level |
| **Role&nbsp;definitions** | Roles can be defined via the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates, and the REST API | Roles can be defined via the Azure admin portal, Microsoft 365 admin portal, and Microsoft Graph Azure AD PowerShell |
