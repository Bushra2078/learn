  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "You have three virtual machines (VM1, VM2, VM3) in a resource group. A new admin is hired, and they need to be able to modify settings on VM3. They shouldn't be able to make changes to VM1 or VM2. How can you implement RBAC to minimize administrative overhead?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assign the admin to the Contributor role on the resource group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Contributor role assignment on the resource group allows the admin to modify all VMs in the resource group."
    - content: "Assign the admin to the Contributor role on VM3."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you assign the Contributor role to the specific resource, the admin can change the settings on that resource; in this case, VM3."
    - content: "Move VM3 to a new resource group, and then assign the admin to the Owner role on VM3."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Owner role gives the admin more permissions than they need. It's best to give only the permissions required."
  - content: "Explain the main differences between Azure roles and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles."
    choices:
    - content: "Azure roles apply to Azure resources. Azure AD roles apply to Azure AD resources such as users, groups, and domains."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.  Azure roles are used to manage access to VMs, storage, and other Azure resources. Azure AD roles are used to manage access to Azure AD resources like user accounts and passwords."
    - content: "Azure roles can be assigned at the root level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure roles can only be assigned at the management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, or resources scope."
    - content: "Azure AD roles are used to manage access to Azure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure roles are used to view and manage Azure resources. Azure roles are used to manage access to VMs, storage, and other Azure resources. Azure AD roles are used to manage access to Azure AD resources like user accounts and passwords."
  - content: "What's included in a custom Azure role definition?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assignment of a custom role"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Role assignment isn't part of a custom role definition."
    - content: "Actions and DataActions operations scoped to the tenant level"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scopes that can apply to an Azure resource are subscription, resource group, and individual resource. Azure AD roles are at the tenant scope."
    - content: "Operations allowed for Azure resources, and scope of permissions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "correct. A custom role definition includes the allowed operations, such as read, write, and delete for Azure resources. The custom role definition also includes the scope of these permissions."
