In this module, you learned about the process of implementing and managing AKS on Azure Stack HCI. 

Using what you have learned, you determined that you can facilitate deployment of internally developed Windows and Linux containerized workloads by using AKS on Azure Stack HCI. In particular:

- AKS on Azure Stack HCI simplifies deployment of Kubernetes clusters by providing an abstraction layer that hides some of the more challenging implementation details.
- Windows Admin Center provides guidance with deploying AKS and Kubernetes clusters on Azure Stack HCI. Also, you can automate their deployments by using PowerShell.
- Azure Arc facilitates the integration of AKS and Kubernetes clusters on Azure Stack HCI, helping companies like Contoso to implement consistent administrative models across on-premises and cloud resources.
- AKS on Azure Stack HCI supports Windows Server and Linux-based node pools in the same Kubernetes cluster, facilitating deployment of containerized applications on both operating system platforms. 
- Kubernetes clusters on Azure Stack HCI allow you to implement a mix of stateless and stateful workloads.
- Windows-based containers on Kubernetes clusters on Azure Stack HCI support integration with AD DS, using the gMSA functionality to provide authenticated access to AD DS-protected resources.
