  questions:
  - content: "You team needs to do and online migration of a 900-GB MongoDB database to Azure Cosmos DB. In the past, you did a similar migration but discovered that it caused some rate limiting errors. You would like to control the rate of your writes to reduce the possibility of this type of errors. Which tool should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "**Azure Data Factory (ADF)**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. ADF should only be used for Offline migrations."
    - content: "**Azure Databricks and Spark**"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This method allows you to set the **maxBatchSize** value which controls the rate at which data is saved to the target Azure Cosmos DB collection giving you control of preventing rate limiting errors."
    - content: "**Azure Data Migration Service (DMS)**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While DMS is recommended for online migrations < 1 TB, DMS doesn't provide you with an option to control data rate, so rate limiting errors could occur."
  - content: "You're about to start your pre-migration planning phase and heard that the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) is a great tool to collect information for a couple of the planning stages? Which planning stages will the DMA not directly collect information for."
    choices:
    - content: "***Pre-migration assessment***"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The DMA assesses the readiness of your existing MongoDB resources for data migration ."
    - content: "***Pre-migration discovery***"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The DMA discovers your existing MongoDB resources and create a data estate spreadsheet to track them."
    - content: "***Pre-migration mapping***"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. While you will use the DMA information it collected for the *Pre-migration assessment* and *Pre-migration discovery* stages for the *Pre-migration mapping* stage, the DMA itself does not collects or do the mapping."
  - content: "During your pre-migration planning, you were informed that some of your planning decisions will be immutable so you have to be careful to get it right the first time. Out of the following decisions you made, which one is considered the most crucial because it can't be changed after the migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Choosing the MongoDB server version."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can change the MongoDB server version at any time. Azure Cosmos DB only enables or disables features when you choose different versions, so it is not an immutable decision."
    - content: "When setting the collection throughput, choose Autoscale or Manual Throughput."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If you are setting the throughput at the collection level, you can change between Autoscale and Manual at any moment, so it is not an immutable decision."
    - content: "Choosing the Shard Key of your collection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. One of the most important decisions you must make on the collection level, is choosing the best possible shard key.  Not only because it will define the performance of your collection, but also because once you set the shard key you cant change it.  This choice is immutable."
