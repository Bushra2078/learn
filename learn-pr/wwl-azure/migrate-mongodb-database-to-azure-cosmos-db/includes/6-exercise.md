In this exercise, we will introduce using Azure DMS to migrate to an Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB account.

This exercise can be completed using a Microsoft Learn *sandbox*, which provides a temporary Azure subscription. To activate the sandbox subscription, you must sign in using a Microsoft account. The sandbox subscription will be automatically deleted when you complete this module. After the sandbox has been activated, [sign into the Azure portal using the credentials for your sandbox subscription](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). Ensure you're working in the **Microsoft Learn Sandbox** directory - indicated at the top right of the portal under your user ID. If not, select the user icon and switch directory.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer, you can use your own Azure subscription. To do so, [sign into the Azure portal using credentials for your subscription](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true). Ensure you are working in the directory containing your subscription - indicated at the top right under your user ID. If not, select the user icon and switch directory.
