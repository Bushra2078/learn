In this module, you learned about the architecture of Common Information Model (CIM) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). The following are the key takeaways:
-	WMI and CIM technologies are based on industry standards that the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) defines. 
-	Both technologies provide a way to connect to the WMI repository. This repository contains management information that you can query and manipulate. 
-	There are two parallel sets of cmdlets that you can use to perform tasks by using WMI or CIM.
-	The repository that CIM and WMI use is organized into namespaces. A namespace is a folder that groups related items for organizational purposes. Namespaces contain classes. 
-	Windows PowerShell Help doesn't contain any information about CIM and WMI classes. CIM and WMI are external technologies that Windows PowerShell can use and understand. Windows PowerShell Help doesn't document the repository classes.
