In this module, you'll learn about the architecture of Common Information Model (CIM) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Both technologies connect to a common information repository that contains management information that you can query and manipulate. The repository contains all kinds of information about a computer system or device. This includes information about hardware, software, hardware drivers, components, roles, services, user settings, and just about every configurable item and the current state of that item. An understanding of the framework and syntax of CIM and WMI will help you know and control almost every aspect of an operating system environment.
