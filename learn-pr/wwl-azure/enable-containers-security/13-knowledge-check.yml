  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "To interact with Azure APIs, an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster requires which of following?"
    choices:
    - content: "AKS contributor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "AKS Contributor does not have enough rights to access the APIs."
    - content: "Azure AD service principal"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Service principal, managed identity. To interact with Azure APIs, an AKS cluster requires either an Azure Active Directory (AD) service principal or a managed identity. A service principal or managed identity is needed to dynamically create and manage other Azure resources such as an Azure load balancer or Azure container registry."
    - content: "Global Administrator permissions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no need to have global admin privileges for AKS."
  - content: "When using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and there is a need to control the flow of traffic between pods and block traffic directly to the backend application; what is the best way to configure this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an AKS network policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Create an AKS network policy. The principle of least privilege should be applied to how traffic can flow between pods in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The Network Policy feature in Kubernetes defines rules for ingress and egress traffic between pods in a cluster."
    - content: "Create an application gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use a network policy to block traffic between pods."
    - content: "Create an Azure firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure Firewall does not block access between pods."
  - content: "The organization is defining RBAC rules for the Azure Kubernetes security team. What is the best solution to grant permissions across the entire cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "ClusterRoles and RoleBindings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Roles are used to grant permissions within a namespace. To grant permissions across the entire cluster, or to cluster resources outside a given namespace, instead use a ClusterRole. Once roles are defined to grant permissions to resources, assign those Kubernetes RBAC permissions with a RoleBinding. Role bindings are used to assign roles for a given namespace. To bind roles across the entire cluster, or to cluster resources outside a given namespace, instead use ClusterRoleBindings."
    - content: "ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding. Roles are used to grant permissions within a namespace. To grant permissions across the entire cluster, or to cluster resources outside a given namespace, instead use a ClusterRole. Once roles are defined to grant permissions to resources, assign those Kubernetes RBAC permissions with a RoleBinding. Role bindings are used to assign roles for a given namespace. To bind roles across the entire cluster, or to cluster resources outside a given namespace, instead use ClusterRoleBindings."
    - content: "Roles and RoleBindings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Roles are used to grant permissions within a namespace.
