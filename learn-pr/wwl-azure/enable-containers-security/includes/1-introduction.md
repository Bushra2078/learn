Containers are a great choice for running applications in Azure. Just like virtual machines, those containers must be locked to protect your data and business. Use the built-in Azure container tools to keep your container-based solutions secure.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses Azure Container Instances, the Container Registry, and access controls to protect your containers; you will work on such tasks as:

 -  Deploy containers from the Container Registry into Azure Container Instances.
 -  Use RBAC and Conditional Access to control access.
 -  Use proper architecture, storage, and network design to optimize container security.

## Skills measured

Securing the Azure platform your cloud solutions run on is a part of [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer](/certifications/exams/az-500).
