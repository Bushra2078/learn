There are different ways to authenticate with and secure Kubernetes clusters. Using role-based access controls (RBAC), you can grant users or groups access to only the resources they need. With Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can further enhance the security and permissions structure by using Microsoft Entra ID. These approaches help you secure your application workloads and customer data.

## Kubernetes service accounts

One of the primary user types in Kubernetes is a service account. A service account exists and is managed by, the Kubernetes API. The credentials for service accounts are stored as Kubernetes secrets, which allows them to be used by authorized pods to communicate with the API Server. Most API requests provide an authentication token for a service account or a normal user account.

Normal user accounts allow more traditional access for human administrators or developers, not just services and processes. Kubernetes itself doesn't provide an identity management solution where regular user accounts and passwords are stored. Instead, external identity solutions can be integrated into Kubernetes. For AKS clusters, this integrated identity solution is Microsoft Entra ID.

## Microsoft Entra integration

The security of AKS clusters can be enhanced with the integration of Microsoft Entra ID. Built on decades of enterprise identity management, Microsoft Entra ID is a multi-tenant, cloud-based directory, and identity management service that combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection. With Microsoft Entra ID, you can integrate on-premises identities into AKS clusters to provide a single source for account management and security.

With Microsoft Entra integrated AKS clusters, you can grant users or groups access to Kubernetes resources within a namespace or across the cluster. To obtain a Kubectl configuration context, a user can run the az aks get-credentials command. When a user then interacts with the AKS cluster with kubectl, they are prompted to sign in with their Microsoft Entra credentials. This approach provides a single source for user account management and password credentials. The user can only access the resources as defined by the cluster administrator.

Microsoft Entra authentication in AKS clusters uses OpenID Connect, an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. OAuth 2.0 defines mechanisms to obtain and use access tokens to access protected resources, and OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
