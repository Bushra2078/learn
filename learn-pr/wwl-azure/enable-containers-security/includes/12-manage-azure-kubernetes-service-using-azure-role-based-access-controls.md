One additional mechanism for controlling access to resources is Azure role-based access controls (RBAC). Kubernetes RBAC is designed to work on resources within your AKS cluster, and Azure RBAC is designed to work on resources within your Azure subscription. With Azure RBAC, you create a role definition that outlines the permissions to be applied. A user or group is then assigned this role definition for a particular scope, which could be an individual resource, a resource group, or across the subscription.

## Roles and ClusterRoles

Before you assign permissions to users with Kubernetes RBAC, you first define those permissions as a Role. Kubernetes roles grant permissions. There is no concept of a deny permission.

Roles are used to grant permissions within a namespace. If you need to grant permissions across the entire cluster, or to cluster resources outside a given namespace, you can instead use ClusterRoles.

A ClusterRole works in the same way to grant permissions to resources, but can be applied to resources across the entire cluster, not a specific namespace.

## RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings

Once roles are defined to grant permissions to resources, you assign those Kubernetes RBAC permissions with a RoleBinding. If your AKS cluster integrates with Azure Active Directory, bindings are how those Azure AD users are granted permissions to perform actions within the cluster.

Role bindings are used to assign roles for a given namespace. This approach lets you logically segregate a single AKS cluster, with users only able to access the application resources in their assigned namespace. If you need to bind roles across the entire cluster, or to cluster resources outside a given namespace, you can instead use ClusterRoleBindings.

A ClusterRoleBinding works in the same way to bind roles to users, but can be applied to resources across the entire cluster, not a specific namespace. This approach lets you grant administrators or support engineers access to all resources in the AKS cluster.

## Kubernetes Secrets​

A Kubernetes Secret is used to inject sensitive data into pods, such as access credentials or keys. You first create a Secret using the Kubernetes API. When you define your pod or deployment, a specific Secret can be requested. Secrets are only provided to nodes that have a scheduled pod that requires it, and the Secret is stored in tmpfs, not written to disk. When the last pod on a node that requires a Secret is deleted, the Secret is deleted from the node's tmpfs. Secrets are stored within a given namespace and can only be accessed by pods within the same namespace.​

The use of Secrets reduces the sensitive information that is defined in the pod or service YAML manifest. Instead, you request the Secret stored in Kubernetes API Server as part of your YAML manifest. This approach only provides the specific pod access to the Secret. Please note: the raw secret manifest files contains the secret data in base64 format. Therefore, this file should be treated as sensitive information, and never committed to source control.​

## Windows containers​

Secrets are written in clear text on the node’s volume (as compared to tmpfs/in-memory on linux). This means customers have to do two things​
* Use file ACLs to secure the secrets file location​
* Use volume-level encryption using BitLocker
