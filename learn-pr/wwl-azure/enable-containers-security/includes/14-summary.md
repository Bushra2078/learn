Keep your containers secure to protect the applications running on them using the Azure Container Registry to supply your containers and Azure Container Instances and Azure Kubernete Service to run and manage them.

You should be able to:

 -  Define the available security tools for containers in Azure
 -  Configure security settings for containers and Kubernetes services
 -  Lock down network, storage, and identity resources connected to your containers
 -  Deploy RBAC to control access to containers
