Azure Virtual Machines (VM) is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. Typically, you choose a VM when you need more control over the computing environment than the other choices offer.

You should now be able to:

 -  Determine virtual machine names, locations and pricing models.
 -  Determine the correct virtual machine size.
 -  Configure virtual machine storage.
 -  Create a virtual machine in the Azure portal.
 -  Select a secure virtual machine connection method.
 -  Configure Windows and Linux virtual machine connections.
