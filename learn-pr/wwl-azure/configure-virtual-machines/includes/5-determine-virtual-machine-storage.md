Just like any other computer, virtual machines in Azure use disks as a place to store an operating system, applications, and data. All Azure virtual machines have at least two disks – a Windows operating system disk (in the case of a Windows VM) and a temporary disk. Virtual machines also can have one or more data disks. All disks are stored as VHDs.

## Operating system disks

Every virtual machine has one attached operating system disk. That OS disk has a pre-installed OS, which was selected when the VM was created. It’s registered as a SATA drive and labeled as the C: drive by default.

## Temporary disk

Every VM contains a temporary disk, which is not a managed disk. The temporary disk provides short-term storage for applications and processes and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files. Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event or when you redeploy a VM. During a standard reboot of the VM, the data on the temporary drive should persist. However, there are cases where the data may not persist, such as moving to a new host. Therefore, any data on the temp drive should not be data that is critical to the system.

 -  On Windows virtual machines, this disk is labeled as the D: drive by default and it used for storing pagefile.sys.
 -  On Linux virtual machines, the disk is typically /dev/sdb and is formatted and mounted to /mnt by the Azure Linux Agent.

## Data disks

A data disk is a managed disk that's attached to a virtual machine to store application data, or other data you need to keep. Data disks are registered as SCSI drives and are labeled with a letter that you choose. Each data disk has a maximum capacity of 4,095 gibibytes (GiB). The size of the virtual machine determines how many data disks you can attach to it and the type of storage you can use to host the disks.

## Virtual machine storage options

Azure Premium Storage delivers high-performance, low-latency disk support for virtual machines (VMs) with input/output (I/O)-intensive workloads. VM disks that use Premium Storage store data on solid-state drives (SSDs). To take advantage of the speed and performance of premium storage disks, you can migrate existing VM disks to Premium Storage.

In Azure, you can attach several premium storage disks to a VM. Using multiple disks gives your applications up to 256 TB of storage per VM. With Premium Storage, your applications can achieve 80,000 I/O operations per second (IOPS) per VM, and a disk throughput of up to 2,000 megabytes per second (MB/s) per VM. Read operations give you low latencies.

Azure offers two ways to create premium storage disks for VMs:

## Unmanaged disks

The original method is to use unmanaged disks. In an unmanaged disk, you manage the storage accounts that you use to store the virtual hard disk (VHD) files that correspond to your VM disks. VHD files are stored as page blobs in Azure storage accounts.

## Managed disks

An Azure-managed disk is a virtual hard disk (VHD). You can think of it like a physical disk in an on-premises server but, virtualized. Azure-managed disks are stored as page blobs, which are a random IO storage object in Azure. We call a managed disk ‘managed’ because it is an abstraction over page blobs, blob containers, and Azure storage accounts. With managed disks, all you have to do is provision the disk, and Azure takes care of the rest. When you select to use Azure-managed disks with your workloads, Azure creates and manages the disk for you. The available types of disks are Ultra Solid State Drives (SSD), Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard Hard Disk Drives (HDD).

For the best performance for your application, we recommend that you migrate any VM disk that requires high IOPS to Premium Storage. If your disk does not require high IOPS, you can help limit costs by keeping it in standard Azure Storage. In standard storage, VM disk data is stored on hard disk drives (HDDs) instead of on SSDs.

> Managed disks are required for the single instance virtual machine SLA (99.95%).
