Azure Virtual Machines is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. Typically, you'll choose a virtual machine if you need more control over the computing environment than the choices such as App Service or Cloud Services offer. Azure Virtual Machines provide you with an operating system, storage, and networking capabilities and can run a wide range of applications.

Virtual machines are part of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. IaaS is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet. Quickly scale up and down with demand and pay only for what you use.

## IaaS business scenarios

 -  **Test and development**. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and development environments, bringing new applications to market faster. IaaS makes it quick and economical to scale up dev-test environments up and down.
 -  **Website hosting**. Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than traditional web hosting.
 -  **Storage, backup, and recovery.** Organizations avoid the expense for storage and complexity of storage management. This typically requires a skilled staff to manage data and meet legal and compliance requirements. IaaS is useful for handling unpredictable demand and steadily growing storage needs. It can also simplify planning and management of backup and recovery systems.
 -  **High-performance computing**. High-performance computing (HPC) on supercomputers, computer grids, or computer clusters helps solve complex problems involving millions of variables or calculations. Examples include earthquake and protein folding simulations, climate and weather predictions, financial modeling, and evaluating product designs.
 -  **Big data analysis**. Big data is a popular term for massive data sets that contain potentially valuable patterns, trends, and associations. Mining data sets to locate or tease out these hidden patterns requires a huge amount of processing power, which IaaS economically provides.
 -  **Extended Datacenter**. Add capacity to your datacenter by adding virtual machines in Azure. Avoid the costs of physically adding hardware or space to your physical location. Connect your physical network to the Azure cloud network seamlessly.
