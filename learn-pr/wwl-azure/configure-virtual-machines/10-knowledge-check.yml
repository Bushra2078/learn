  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which workload option would you select to run a network appliance on a virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Compute optimized"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Compute optimized virtual machines are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio. Suitable for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers."
    - content: "Memory optimized"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Memory optimized virtual machines are better for large in-memory business critical workloads requiring massive parallel compute power."
    - content: "Storage optimized"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Storage optimized virtual machines are better for data warehousing applications and large transactional databases."
  - content: "Your organization has a security policy that prohibits exposing SSH ports to the outside world. What is the best way to connect to the Azure Linux virtual machines and install software?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure the Bastion service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Azure Bastion service is a new fully platform-managed PaaS service that you provision inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP and SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly in the Azure portal over SSL. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines do not need a public IP address."
    - content: "Configure a Guest configuration on the virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Can you think of a better answer?"
    - content: "Create a custom script extension."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Custom script extensions are for post deployment configuration, software installation, or any other configuration or management tasks."
  - content: "What is the effect of the default network security settings for a new virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Neither outbound nor inbound requests are allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Outbound requests are allowed by default."
    - content: "Outbound request is allowed. Inbound traffic is only allowed from within the virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Outbound requests are considered low risk, so they are allowed by default. Inbound traffic from within the virtual network is allowed. By placing a VM in a virtual network, the VM owner is implicitly opting-in to communication among the resources in the virtual network."
    - content: "There are no restrictions: all outbound and inbound requests are allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There are restrictions on inbound traffic."
