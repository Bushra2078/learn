With the wide range of data stores available in Azure, there is the need to manage and orchestrate the movement data between them. In fact, you will want to automate many as a regular process of data movement as part of a wider enterprise analytical solution. Both Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Pipelines meet that need, and in this section, you will be introduced to Azure Synapse Pipelines, its component parts, the pipeline process, and how to use the canvas to design a standard style pipeline in Synapse Studio, which is nearly identical to Azure Data Factory.

At the end of this module, you should:

- understand Azure Synapse Analytics Pipelines from a high level.
- be able to explain the Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline process(es).
- understand the major components which make up Azure Synapse Analytics Pipelines which are directly relatable to Azure Data Factory.
- have been able to execute a complete Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline.
