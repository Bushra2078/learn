In this module we saw the similarities between Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Pipelines and a lab using Synapse Pipelines. We also discovered that tools such as purview and the use of Azure Data Lake can help us reduce costs as it is accessible from downstream tooling. Finally, we see that with orchestration and integration with Purview, we see that Azure provides full data lineage which is instrumental to ensuring complete control over your data and providing a single version of the truth.
