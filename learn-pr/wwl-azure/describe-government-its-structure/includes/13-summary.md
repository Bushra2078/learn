In this module, you learned about the levels of government in the United States: National, State, Local, and Tribal. You also learned how each level of government may leverage U.S. Sovereign Clouds to meet their own requirements.

You learned that each level of government includes an executive, legislative, and judicial branch. You also learned how each of those branches were reflected at each level of government.

You learned about the Federal Executive branch, its leadership, cabinet-level agencies, non-cabinet-level agencies, boards, commissions, and other entities.
