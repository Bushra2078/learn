        NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a physical sciences laboratory and a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. Its mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness.

        NIST organizes its activities into laboratory programs that include nanoscale science and technology, engineering, information technology, neutron research, material measurement, and physical measurement.
        
        From 1901â€“1988, the agency was named the National Bureau of Standards.
        
        The Articles of Confederation, predecessor to the US Constitution, actually called for the Government to set regulations on currency, and specifically weights and measures.

## Impact on cloud strategy

NIST is a dominant force in the U.S. government's cloud strategy because it sets standards for technology.

Such strategic standards include:

- federal vulnerability disclosure
- cybersecurity
- IoT devices
- access control
- Attribute-Based Access Control
- Zero Trust Architecture
- DevSecOps
- Microservices
- firmware resiliency
- DDoS Mitigation
- 5G and LTE security
- Controlled Unclassified Information
- and numerous other subjects

### Security and privacy controls

One of the most commonly cited NIST special publications is NIST special publication (SP) 800-53.

NIST special publication 800-53 provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations.

The publication seeks to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

The diverse set of threats identified includes hostile attacks, human errors, natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks.

The controls that NIST special publication 800-53 identifies "are flexible, customizable, and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk.

The controls also address "diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines."

Finally, the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective.

The strength of the functions provided by the controls  determines the information assurance.

The publication also notes "Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology products...are sufficiently trustworthy."
