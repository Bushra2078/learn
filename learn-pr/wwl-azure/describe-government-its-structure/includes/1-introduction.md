        Sovereign Clouds are secure, compliant, regional cloud computing offerings for sensitive and regulated workloads, architected and implemented to meet data residency and data sovereignty requirements.
        
        Sovereign clouds build upon the capabilities of commercial clouds, but ensure that all data, compute, networking, and storage remain on sovereign soil and prevents access to those cloud computing capabilities to foreign entities under all potential circumstances. Such cloud environments protect critical data, while also unlocking and making available its power to cloud consumers.

Microsoft operates several sovereign cloud offerings globally for its customers. One of these offerings is the United States Sovereign Clouds, or U.S. Sovereign Clouds. In order to understand the purpose of U.S. Sovereign Clouds, it's critical to understand the government entities within the United States.

In this module, you'll learn about the basics of government in the United States, its structure, and the entities that have a major influence on government cloud strategy.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to describe:

- The levels of government, including federal, state, local and tribal. U.S. sovereign clouds aren't limited to only federal government entities, and may be leveraged by government entities at multiple levels.

- The branches of government and the role each branch plays in determining the government's cloud strategy. While each branch serves differing purposes, each has its own ways to influence the cloud computing adoption by the government.

- U.S. government entity types, how are they structured, and the authority they have toward governmental cloud strategy.

- U.S. Government entities that have the most influence over government cloud strategy and adoption.

## Prerequisites

- You should be familiar with basic cloud computing concepts and terminology.

- You should have a general understanding of why government exists and the purpose it serves.
