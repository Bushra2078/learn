        The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the largest office within the Executive Office of the President of the United States, responsible for creating the president's annual budget, as well as reviewing programs, policies, and procedures to determine whether they align and support the president's policies.
        
        OMB is also responsible for the coordination of inter-agency policy initiatives. Across agencies, it also assesses agency performance, procurement, financial management and information technology. It coordinates matters of privacy policy, information policy, as well as information collection requests. The OMB clears agency testimony, proposed legislation, communications with Congress. It also coordinates Presidential actions, including Presidential Executive Orders and memoranda to agency leaders before they are officially issued.

        It may be considered the executive functioning component of the executive branch.

## Staff

Career-appointed personnel comprise the Office of Management and Budget staff. These personnel are in place to provide consistency across administrations. The president appoints and the United States Senate confirms many of these staff members.

## Structure

The largest components are five resource management offices.

The resource management offices are staffed by Program Examiners, who are aligned with major programs throughout the US Government, to monitor both management and budget of those programs

## Operations

Program Examiners review requests from programs to determine which requests will be put into the Presidentâ€™s budget request to congress.

Program Officers also provide direct advice to internal offices, such as the Office of E-Government and Information Technology.

## OMB versus the United States Congress

> [!NOTE]
> The federal fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30 of each year.

While OMB program examiners determine the requests to be put into President's budget request, it's the United States Congress that controls spending and is responsible for producing an annual budget to fund all federal programs. The funded budget is what shapes the United States' priorities by allocating funding to federal resources.

## Impact on cloud strategy

The Federal Chief Information Officer ("Federal CIO") of the United States leads the Office of E-Government and IT. The Federal CIO oversees federal technology spending, federal IT policy, and strategic planning of all federal IT investments, including cloud services.

The Federal CIO is also charged with establishing a government-wide enterprise architecture that ensures system interoperability, information sharing, and maintaining effective information security and privacy controls across the federal government.

> [!NOTE]
> The Federal CIO is not the same as the Federal CTO.

### Supporting the OMB

Prior to and after their official issuance, Microsoft ensures that its cloud services align with OMB memoranda and Presidential Executive Orders. To ensure its customers may support the requirements of the memoranda and Executive Orders, Microsoft makes available strategic teams through its Office of the CTO.
