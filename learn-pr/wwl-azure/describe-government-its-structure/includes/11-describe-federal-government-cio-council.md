        - Optimizing Federal Government information resources and investments

### Broad and deep influence

From a legal (statutory) perspective, the Federal CIO Council is charged with:

- Developing recommendations for the Director of OMB on government information resources management policies and requirements;
- Sharing experiences, ideas, best practices, and innovative approaches related to information resources management;
- Assisting the Federal CIO in the identification, development, and coordination of multi-agency projects and other innovative initiatives to improve Government performance through the use of information technology;
- Promoting the development and use of common performances for agency information resources management; and
- Working with the Office of Personnel Management to assess and address the hiring, training, classification, and professional development of the Federal IT workforce.

As a result, the Federal CIO has significantly broad influence in the U.S. Government's cloud computing strategy, especially as it relates to managing cloud and procuring cloud computing services; as well as developing the Federal workforce to leverage cloud computing technologies to meet their individual agency charters.
