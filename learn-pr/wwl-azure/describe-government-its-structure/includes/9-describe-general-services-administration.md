        The GSA, or General Services Agency, is an independent agency formed in 1949 to support basic capabilities and functioning of many federal agencies.
        
        The GSA helps manage and support the basic functioning of federal agencies. GSA supplies products and communications for U.S. government offices. It provides transportation and office space to federal employees.
        
        GSA also develops government-wide cost-minimizing policies and other management tasks. It oversees procurement of more than $70 billion in goods and services and manages $500 billion in U.S. Government real estate.

## Impact on cloud strategy

### Compliance and governance

One of the 12 offices within the GSA is the Office of GSA IT. GSA IT provides guidelines for monitoring and reporting on compliance with laws, regulations, orders, and directives. It provides an agencyâ€™s enterprise architecture as a framework for managing IT services, including cloud services. It also offers guidance on how best to leverage IT services, such as cloud services, to support mission objectives and service objectives.

### Procurement

Because it operates on such a large scale, GSA centralizes procurement of goods and services, such as U.S. Sovereign Cloud services, for the federal government.
