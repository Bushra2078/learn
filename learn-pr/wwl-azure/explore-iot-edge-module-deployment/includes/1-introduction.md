The tools and processes that are used to deploy components to the IoT Edge can take some getting used to.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to move cloud processing capabilities to the device-side by implementing IoT Edge devices and modules. You decide to gain experience by deploying an IoT Edge device and modules within a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:

 -  Deploy an Azure IoT Edge Enabled Linux VM.
 -  Create an IoT Edge device identity in IoT Hub using Azure CLI.
 -  Connect the IoT Edge device to IoT Hub.
 -  Deploy an IoT Edge module that acts as a temperature sensor.
 -  Deploy Azure Stream Analytics module that analyzes temperature data on the IoT Edge device.

By the end of this module, you will be able to implement the process for deploying devices and modules to the IoT Edge.
