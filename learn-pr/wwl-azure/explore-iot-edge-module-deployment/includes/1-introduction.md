Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to move cloud processing capabilities to the device-side by implementing IoT Edge devices and modules. You decide to gain experience by deploying an IoT Edge device and modules within a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:<br>

 -  Deploy an Azure IoT Edge Enabled Linux VM.
 -  Create an IoT Edge device identity in IoT Hub using Azure CLI.
 -  Connect the IoT Edge device to IoT Hub.
 -  Deploy an IoT Edge module that acts as a temperature sensor.
 -  Deploy Azure Stream Analytics module that analyzes temperature data on the IoT Edge device.
