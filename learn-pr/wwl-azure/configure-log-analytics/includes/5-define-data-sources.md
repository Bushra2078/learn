When you configure the Log Analytics settings, the available data sources are shown. Data sources include: Windows Event Logs, Windows Performance Counters, Linux Performance Counters, IIS Logs, Custom Fields, Custom Logs, and Syslog. Each data source has additional configuration options. For example, the Windows Event Log can be configured to forward Error, Warning, or Informational messages.
