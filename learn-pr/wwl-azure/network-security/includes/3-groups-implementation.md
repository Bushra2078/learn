When implementing NSGs, keep these are the limits to in mind:

* By default, you can create 100 NSGs per region per subscription. You can raise this limit to 400 by contacting Azure support.

* You can apply only one NSG to a VM, subnet, or network adapter.

* By default, you can have up to 200 rules in a single NSG. You can raise this limit to 500 by contacting Azure support.

* You can apply an NSG to multiple resources.

An individual subnet can have zero, or one, associated NSG. An individual network interface can also have zero, or one, associated NSG. So, you can effectively have dual traffic restriction for a virtual machine by associating an NSG first to a subnet, and then another NSG to the VM's network interface. The application of NSG rules in this case depends on the direction of traffic and priority of applied security rules.

Consider a simple example with one virtual machine as follows:

* The virtual machine is placed inside the Contoso Subnet.
* Contoso Subnet is associated with Subnet NSG.
* The VM network interface is additionally associated with VM NSG.

In this example, for inbound traffic, the Subnet NSG is evaluated first. Any traffic allowed through Subnet NSG is then evaluated by VM NSG. The reverse is applicable for outbound traffic, with VM NSG being evaluated first. Any traffic allowed through VM NSG is then evaluated by Subnet NSG.

This allows for granular security rule application. For example, you might want to allow inbound internet access to a few application VMs (such as frontend VMs) under a subnet but restrict inbound internet access to other VMs (such as database and other backend VMs). In this case you can have a more lenient rule on the Subnet NSG, allowing internet traffic, and restrict access to specific VMs by denying access on VM NSG. The same can be applied for outbound traffic.

To help secure and protect your Azure resources, make sure NSG planning is standard operating procedure (SOP) for your deployments.

### How traffic is evaluated

Several resources from Azure services can be deployed into an Azure virtual network. You can associate zero, or one, network security group to each virtual network subnet and network interface in a virtual machine. The same network security group can be associated to as many subnets and network interfaces as you choose.

The following picture illustrates different scenarios for how network security groups might be deployed to allow network traffic to and from the internet over TCP port 80:

Reference the above diagram, along with the following text, to understand how Azure processes inbound and outbound rules for network security groups:

### Inbound traffic

For inbound traffic, Azure processes the rules in a network security group associated to a subnet first, if there is one, and then the rules in a network security group associated to the network interface, if there is one.
* **VM1**: The security rules in NSG1 are processed, since it is associated to Subnet1 and VM1 is in Subnet1. Unless you've created a rule that allows port 80 inbound, the traffic is denied by the **DenyAllInbound default security rule**, and never evaluated by NSG2, since NSG2 is associated to the network interface. If NSG1 has a security rule that allows port 80, the traffic is then processed by NSG2. To allow port 80 to the virtual machine, both NSG1 and NSG2 must have a rule that allows port 80 from the internet.
* **VM2**: The rules in NSG1 are processed because VM2 is also in Subnet1. Since VM2 does not have a network security group associated to its network interface, it receives all traffic allowed through NSG1 or is denied all traffic denied by NSG1. Traffic is either allowed or denied to all resources in the same subnet when a network security group is associated to a subnet.
* **VM3**: Since there is no network security group associated to Subnet2, traffic is allowed into the subnet and processed by NSG2, because NSG2 is associated to the network interface attached to VM3.
* **VM4**: Traffic is allowed to VM4, because a network security group isn't associated to Subnet3, or the network interface in the virtual machine. All network traffic is allowed through a subnet and network interface if they don't have a network security group associated to them.

### Outbound traffic

For outbound traffic, Azure processes the rules in a network security group associated to a network interface first, if there is one, and then the rules in a network security group associated to the subnet, if there is one.
* **VM1**: The security rules in NSG2 are processed. Unless you create a security rule that denies port 80 outbound to the internet, the traffic is allowed by the AllowInternetOutbound default security rule in both NSG1 and NSG2. If NSG2 has a security rule that denies port 80, the traffic is denied, and never evaluated by NSG1. To deny port 80 from the virtual machine, either, or both of the network security groups must have a rule that denies port 80 to the internet.
* **VM2**: All traffic is sent through the network interface to the subnet, since the network interface attached to VM2 does not have a network security group associated to it. The rules in NSG1 are processed.
* **VM3**: If NSG2 has a security rule that denies port 80, the traffic is denied. If NSG2 has a security rule that allows port 80, then port 80 is allowed outbound to the internet, since a network security group is not associated to Subnet2.
* **VM4**: All network traffic is allowed from VM4, because a network security group isn't associated to the network interface attached to the virtual machine, or to Subnet3.

### Intra-subnet traffic

It's important to note that security rules in an NSG associated to a subnet can affect connectivity between VM's within it. For example, if a rule is added to NSG1 which denies all inbound and outbound traffic, VM1 and VM2 will no longer be able to communicate with each other. Another rule would have to be added specifically to allow this.

### General guidelines

Unless you have a specific reason to, we recommended that you associate a network security group to a subnet, or a network interface, but not both. Since rules in a network security group associated to a subnet can conflict with rules in a network security group associated to a network interface, you can have unexpected communication problems that require troubleshooting.
