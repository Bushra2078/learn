Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port. Azure Load Balancer works that way.

Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers. For example, you can route traffic based on the incoming URL. So if /images is in the incoming URL, you can route traffic to a specific set of servers (known as a pool) configured for images. If /video is in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that's optimized for videos.

Application Gateway includes the following features:
* **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS) termination** - Application gateway supports SSL/TLS termination at the gateway, after which traffic typically flows unencrypted to the backend servers. This feature allows web servers to be unburdened from costly encryption and decryption overhead.
* **Autoscaling** - Application Gateway Standard_v2 supports autoscaling and can scale up or down based on changing traffic load patterns. Autoscaling also removes the requirement to choose a deployment size or instance count during provisioning.
* **Zone redundancy** - A Standard_v2 Application Gateway can span multiple Availability Zones, offering better fault resiliency and removing the need to provision separate Application Gateways in each zone.
* **Static VIP** - The application gateway Standard_v2 SKU supports static VIP type exclusively. This ensures that the VIP associated with application gateway doesn't change even over the lifetime of the Application Gateway.
* **Web Application Firewall** - Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a service that provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. WAF is based on rules from the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) core rule sets 3.1 (WAF_v2 only), 3.0, and 2.2.9.
* **Ingress Controller for AKS** - Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) allows you to use Application Gateway as the ingress for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
* **URL-based routing** - URL Path Based Routing allows you to route traffic to back-end server pools based on URL Paths of the request. One of the scenarios is to route requests for different content types to different pool.
* **Multiple-site hosting** - Multiple-site hosting enables you to configure more than one web site on the same application gateway instance. This feature allows you to configure a more efficient topology for your deployments by adding up to 100 web sites to one Application Gateway (for optimal performance).
* **Redirection** - A common scenario for many web applications is to support automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection to ensure all communication between an application and its users occurs over an encrypted path.
* **Session affinity** - The cookie-based session affinity feature is useful when you want to keep a user session on the same server.
* **Websocket and HTTP/2 traffic** - Application Gateway provides native support for the WebSocket and HTTP/2 protocols. There's no user-configurable setting to selectively enable or disable WebSocket support.
* **Connection draining** - Connection draining helps you achieve graceful removal of backend pool members during planned service updates.
* **Custom error pages** - Application Gateway allows you to create custom error pages instead of displaying default error pages. You can use your own branding and layout using a custom error page.
* **Rewrite HTTP headers** - HTTP headers allow the client and server to pass additional information with the request or the response. 
* **Sizing** - Application Gateway Standard_v2 can be configured for autoscaling or fixed size deployments. This SKU doesn't offer different instance sizes.

New Application Gateway v1 SKU deployments can take up to 20 minutes to provision. Changes to instance size or count aren't disruptive, and the gateway remains active during this time.

Most deployments that use the v2 SKU take around 6 minutes to provision. However it can take longer depending on the type of deployment. For example, deployments across multiple Availability Zones with many instances can take more than 6 minutes.
