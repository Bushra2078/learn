Network traffic can be filtered to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network with a **network security group**. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources
For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

VMs that you create via the Resource Manager deployment model can have direct connectivity to the internet by using a public IP address that is directly assigned to the VMs. Only with the host firewall configured inside the VMs helps protect these VMs from the internet.

VMs that you create by using the classic deployment model communicate with internet resources through the cloud service that is assigned the public IP address, which is also known as the VIP. VMs that reside inside the cloud service share that VIP and establish communication with internet resources by using endpoints. If you remove the VM endpoints that map the public port and public IP address of the cloud service to the private port and private IP address of the VM, the VM becomes unreachable from the internet via the public IP address.

Network Security Groups (NSGs) help provide advanced security for the VMs you create via either deployment model (Resource Manager or classic). NSGs control inbound and outbound traffic passing through a network adapter (in the Resource Manager deployment model), a VM (in the classic deployment model), or a subnet (in both deployment models).

### Network Security Group rules

NSGs contain rules that specify whether traffic will be approved or denied. Each rule is based on a source IP address, a source port, a destination IP address, and a destination port. Based on whether the traffic matches this combination, the rule either allows or denies the traffic. Each rule consists of the following properties:

* **Name**. This is a unique identifier for the rule.

* **Direction**. This specifies whether the traffic is inbound or outbound.

* **Priority**. If multiple rules match the traffic, rules with a higher priority apply.

* **Access**. This specifies whether the traffic is allowed or denied.

* **Source IP address prefix**. This prefix identifies where the traffic originated from. It can be based on a single IP address; a range of IP addresses in Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) notation; or the asterisk (*), which is a wildcard that matches all possible IP addresses.

* **Source port range**. This specifies source ports by using either a single port number from 1 through 65,535; a range of ports (for example, 200–400); or the asterisk (*) to denote all possible ports.

* **Destination IP address prefix**. This identifies the traffic destination based on a single IP address, a range of IP addresses in CIDR notation, or the asterisk (*) to match all possible IP addresses.

* **Destination port range**. This specifies destination ports by using either a single port number from 1 through 65,535; a range of ports (for example, 200–400); or the asterisk (*) to denote all possible ports .

* **Protocol**. This specifies a protocol that matches the rule. It can be UDP, TCP, or the asterisk (*).

### Custom Network Security Group rules

Predefined default rules exist for inbound and outbound traffic. You can’t delete these rules, but you can override them, because they have the lowest priority. The default rules allow all inbound and outbound traffic within a virtual network, allow outbound traffic towards the internet, and allow inbound traffic to an Azure load balancer. A default rule with the lowest priority also exists in both the inbound and outbound sets of rules that denies all network communication.

When you create a custom rule, you can use default tags in the source and destination IP address prefixes to specify predefined categories of IP addresses. These default tags are:

* **Internet**. This tag represents internet IP addresses.

* **Virtual_network**. This tag identifies all IP addresses that the IP range for the virtual network defines. It also includes IP address ranges from on-premises networks when they are defined as local network to virtual network.

* **Azure_loadbalancer**. This tag specifies the default Azure load balancer destination.

### Planning Network Security Groups

You can design NSGs to isolate virtual networks in security zones, like the model used by on-premises infrastructure does. You can apply NSGs to subnets, which allows you to create protected screened subnets, or DMZs, that can restrict traffic flow to all the machines residing within that subnet. With the classic deployment model, you can also assign NSGs to individual computers to control traffic that is both destined for and leaving the VM. With the Resource Manager deployment model, you can assign NSGs to a network adapter so that NSG rules control only the traffic that flows through that network adapter. If the VM has multiple network adapters, NSG rules won’t automatically be applied to traffic that is designated for other network adapters.

You create NSGs as resources in a resource group, but you can share them with other resource groups in your subscription.
