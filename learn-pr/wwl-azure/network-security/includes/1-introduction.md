Network security could be defined as the process of protecting resources from unauthorized access or attack by applying controls to network traffic. The goal is to ensure that only legitimate traffic is allowed. Azure includes a robust networking infrastructure to support your application and service connectivity requirements. Network connectivity is possible between resources located in Azure, between on-premises and Azure hosted resources, and to and from the internet and Azure.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses network security features to restrict, monitor, and manage network traffic once it reaches your Azure network; you will work on such tasks as:

 -  Setup network security groups and application security groups.
 -  Deploy Service Endpoints and Private Links.
 -  Configure Front Door and ExpressRoute.

## Skills measured

Securing the Azure platform your cloud solutions run on is a part of [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer](/learn/certifications/exams/az-500).

Implement platform protection (15-20%)

 -  Implement advanced network security
     -  Secure the connectivity of virtual networks (VPN authentication, Express Route encryption)
     -  Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs)
     -  Configure Azure Front Door service as an Application Gateway
     -  Configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Application Gateway
     -  Implement Service Endpoints

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

 -  Deploy and configure network security groups to protect your Azure solutions
 -  Configure and lockdown service endpoints and private links
 -  Secure your applications with Application Gateway, Web App Firewall, and Front Door
 -  Configure ExpressRoute to help protect your network traffic
