Think of security in layers, and the network layer is important. You need to lock down the network with tools like security groups, Bastion, and Front Door. When, a bad-actor has to invest time and effort to break into your network or gain access to resources if they break in the more likely they are to leave you alone.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses network security features to restrict, monitor, and manage network traffic once it reaches your Azure network; you will work on such tasks as:

 -  Setup network security groups and application security groups.
 -  Deploy Service Endpoints and Private Links.
 -  Configure Front Door and ExpressRoute.

## Skills measured

Securing the Azure platform your cloud solutions run on is a part of [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer](/learn/certifications/exams/az-500).

Implement platform protection (15-20%)

 -  Implement advanced network security
     -  Secure the connectivity of virtual networks (VPN authentication, Express Route encryption)
     -  Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs)
     -  Configure Azure Front Door service as an Application Gateway
     -  Configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Application Gateway
     -  Implement Service Endpoints

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

 -  Deploy and configure network security groups to protect your Azure solutions
 -  Configure and lockdown service endpoints and private links
 -  Secure your applications with Application Gateway, Web App Firewall, and Front Door
 -  Configure ExpressRoute to help protect your network traffic
