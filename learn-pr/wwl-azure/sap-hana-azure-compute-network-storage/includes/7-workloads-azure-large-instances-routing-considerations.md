Azure implements a default routing configuration that facilitates basic connectivity, including the ability to reach the internet and to communicate with other resources on the same or directly connected virtual networks. You can modify this default configuration in two ways:

* **Creating user-defined routes**, which are route tables with one or more rules altering the default routing behavior and associate them with virtual network subnets. These rules apply to any traffic leaving these subnets and targeting IP address ranges that you referenced as prefixes in the route table. This allows you to affect routing behavior between subnets in the same virtual network, between connected virtual networks, between on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks in hybrid scenarios, and on traffic from virtual network subnets to the internet.

* **Configuring Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing**, which facilitates dynamic route exchange between on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks in hybrid scenarios. This allows you to affect routing behavior between on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks in hybrid scenarios and traffic from virtual network subnets to the internet (for example, by implementing forced tunneling).

The rules that dictate routing behavior applicable to SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) are as follows:

* By default, SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) can be accessed only through Azure VMs and the dedicated ExpressRoute connection, not directly from on-premises. The transitive routing restrictions are due to the current Azure network architecture used for SAP HANA Large Instance. Some administration clients and any applications that need direct access, such as SAP Solution Manager running on-premises, wonâ€™t be able to connect to the SAP HANA database by default.

* If you have HANA Large Instance units deployed in two different Azure regions for disaster recovery, the same transient routing restrictions applied in the past. In other words, IP addresses of a HANA Large Instance unit in one region (for example, US West) were not routed to a HANA Large Instance unit deployed in another region (for example, US East). This restriction was independent of the use of Azure network peering across regions or cross connecting the ExpressRoute circuits that connect HANA Large Instance units to virtual networks. This restriction, which came with the deployed architecture, prohibited the immediate use of HANA System Replication as disaster recovery functionality. 

* SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) units have an assigned IP address from the server IP pool address range that you submitted when requesting the HANA Large Instance deployment. This IP address is accessible through the Azure subscriptions and circuit that connects Azure virtual networks to HANA Large Instances. The IP address assigned out of that server IP pool address range is directly assigned to the hardware unit. It's not assigned through NAT anymore, as was the case in the first deployments of this solution.

As described above, by default the transitive routing between HANA Large Instance units and on-premises or between HANA Large Instance routing that are deployed in two different regions does not work. There are several possibilities to enable such a transitive routing.

* ExpressRoute Global Reach

* A reverse-proxy to route data, to and from SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) . This can be, for example, F5 BIG-IP or NGINX with Traffic Manager deployed in the Azure virtual network.

* IPTables rules in a Linux VM to enable routing between on-premises locations and HANA Large Instance units, or between HANA Large Instance units in different regions. The VM running IPTables needs to be deployed in the Azure virtual network that connects to HANA Large Instances and to on-premises network. The VM needs to be sized accordingly, so, that the network throughput of the VM is enough for the expected network traffic. 

* Azure Firewall to direct traffic between on-premises and HANA Large instance units.

With a reverse-proxy, IPTables, and Azure Firewall, traffic routed through an Azure virtual network could be additionally filtered by Azure Network Security Groups, so, that certain IP addresses or IP address ranges from on-premises could be blocked or explicitly allowed to access HANA Large Instances. Be aware that implementation and support for custom solutions involving third-party network appliances or IPTables isn't provided by Microsoft. Support must be provided by the vendor of the component used or the integrator.
