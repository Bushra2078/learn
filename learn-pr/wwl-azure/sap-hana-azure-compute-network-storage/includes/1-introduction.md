
SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) provides virtual machines for deploying and running SAP HANA. The VMs also provide the capability for running and deploying dedicated SAP HANA on bare-metal servers. The SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) solution builds on non-shared host/server bare-metal hardware that is assigned to you. The server hardware is embedded in larger stamps that contain compute/server, networking, and storage infrastructure. As a combination, it's HANA tailored data center integration (TDI) certified. SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) offers different server SKUs or sizes. Units can have 36 Intel CPU cores and 768 GB of memory and go up to units that have up to 480 Intel CPU cores and up to 24 TB of memory. 

## Learning objectives 

In this module you will be able to:

* Recognize the wide range of Azure virtual machines sizes offered for SAP HANA that recommendations for vCPU, memory, disks, and network throughput.

* Reference the storage layout implementation according to the recommendation of the SAP HANA tailored data center integration (TDI)  

* Describe how the architecture of Azure network services is a key component of the successful deployment of SAP applications on HANA Large Instance. The Azure for SAP HANA architecture uses both virtual and physical networks. 

* List the recommendations for connecting single and multiple SAP systems.
