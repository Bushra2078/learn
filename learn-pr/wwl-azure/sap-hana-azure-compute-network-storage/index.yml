title: SAP HANA on Azure Compute, Network, and Storage
summary: SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) provides virtual machines for deploying and running SAP HANA. This module explores the SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) solution that builds on assigned, non-shared host/server bare-metal hardware.
abstract: |
  In this module you will be able to:
  * Recognize the wide range of Azure virtual machines sizes offered for SAP HANA that recommendations for vCPU, memory, disks, and network throughput.
  * Reference the storage layout implementation according to the recommendation of the SAP HANA tailored data center integration (TDI)
  * Describe how the architecture of Azure network services is a key component of the successful deployment of SAP applications on HANA Large Instance. The Azure for SAP HANA architecture uses both virtual and physical networks.
  * List the recommendations for connecting single and multiple SAP systems.
  * Discuss the rules for controlling routing behavior for SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances).
prerequisites: |
  Prior to taking this course, it is recommended that you have taken the Azure Administrator (AZ-103) exam, as well as SAP HANA or NetWeaver training.
