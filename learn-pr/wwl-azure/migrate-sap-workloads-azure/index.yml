abstract: |
  In this module, you will understand the difference between Classic Migration and SAP Database Migration Option (DMO) sometimes referred to as one-step and two-step migration, respectively.
  - Classical Migration: SAPâ€™s Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM) is used as the Software Logistics (SL) tool and is exclusively for database migrations. Classical Migration uses a heterogenous system copy approach and is sometimes referred to as two-step migration.
  - SAP Database Migration Option (DMO): DMO facilitates both an SAP upgrade and a database migration to the SAP HANA database using one tool. DMO process is often referred to as a one-step migration.
  You will see how the Software Update Manager (SUM) tool creates a shadow repository for an existing database while a target database is created in parallel; eventually the shadow repository is copied and the SAP database connection is switched to the target database.
