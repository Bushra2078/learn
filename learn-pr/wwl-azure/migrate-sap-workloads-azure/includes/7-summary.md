In this module you saw the difference between Classic Migration and SAP Database Migration Option (DMO), occasionally referred to as one-step and two-step migration, respectively.

* **Classical Migration:** SAPâ€™s Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM) is used as the Software Logistics (SL) tool and is exclusively used for database migrations. Classical Migration uses a heterogeneous system copy approach and is sometimes referred to as two-step migration.
* **SAP Database Migration Option (DMO):** DMO facilitates an SAP upgrade and a database migration to the SAP HANA database using a single tool. The DMO process is occasionally referred to as a one-step migration.

You also examined how the Software Update Manager (SUM) tool can be used to create a shadow repository for an existing database and a target database at the same time.

Lastly, you reviewed how Very Large Databases (VLDBs) are moved to Azure and how database larger than 20TB require additional procedures to migrate from on-premises to Azure for minimal downtime and risk.
