Developing custom modules for Azure IoT Edge solutions requires a development process that some developers may not be accustomed to.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to develop custom solutions for the IoT Edge that can be implemented as part of the company's IoT solution. You decide to gain experience implementing custom IoT Edge solutions by developing a custom module and trying the debugger tools within a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:

 -  Configure the IoT Edge code development environment and container registry.
 -  Create and debug a custom IoT Edge module.
 -  Publish the module to the Azure Container Registry and prepare for deployment.

By the end of this module, you will be able to develop custom modules for Azure IoT Edge solutions.
