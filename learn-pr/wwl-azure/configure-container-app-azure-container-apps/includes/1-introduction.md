Azure Container Apps is a fully managed environment that enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. It allows you to deploy API endpoints, host background processing jobs, handle event-driven processing, and run microservices. Applications built on Azure Container Apps can dynamically scale based on HTTP traffic, event-driven processing, CPU or memory load, and any KEDA-supported scaler.

Imagine you are a DevOps engineer or developer who needs to deploy a microservice application that can handle event-driven processing. You decide to use Azure Container Apps to deploy your application. With Azure Container Apps, you can easily deploy your application without worrying about managing cloud infrastructure and complex container orchestrators. You can also take advantage of the benefits of running containers, such as dynamic scaling, while leaving behind the concerns of managing cloud infrastructure and complex container orchestrators.

The module covers the following topics: Reviewing the Azure Container Apps service, Examining Azure Container Apps containers and containers registries, Creating a container app and container app environment, Examining managed identities in Azure Container Apps, Examining ingress in Azure Container Apps, Managing secrets in Azure Container Apps, Using storage mounts in Azure Container Apps, and Examining cloud service connections in Azure Container Apps.

The goal of this module is to provide an overview of Azure Container Apps and its features, as well as to teach you how to create and manage container apps, configure managed identities, ingress, storage mounts, and cloud service connections.
