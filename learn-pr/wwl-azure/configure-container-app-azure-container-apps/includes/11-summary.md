In this module, you have learned about Azure Container Apps, a fully managed environment that enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. You can deploy API endpoints, host background processing jobs, handle event-driven processing, and run microservices. Azure Container Apps can dynamically scale based on HTTP traffic, event-driven processing, CPU or memory load, and any KEDA-supported scaler. You can execute application code packaged in any container and enjoy the benefits of running containers while leaving behind the concerns of managing cloud infrastructure and complex container orchestrators.

The main takeaways from this module are that Azure Container Apps supports multiple types of storage, including container file system, ephemeral volume, and Azure Files volume. You can use managed identities to authenticate to any service that supports Microsoft Entra authentication. You can also use Service Connector to connect to cloud services in just a few steps. Service Connector manages the configuration of the network settings and connection information between different services.
