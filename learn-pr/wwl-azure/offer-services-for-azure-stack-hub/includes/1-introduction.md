As an Azure Stack Hub operator, you configure and deliver services by using offers, plans, and subscriptions. Offers contain one or more plans, and each plan includes one or more services, each configured with quotas. By creating plans and combining them into different offers, users can subscribe to your offers and deploy resources. After you've created the offer, your users can subscribe to it to access the services and deploy resources. Users can subscribe to as many offers as they want.

You can offer Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) services that enable your users to build an on-demand computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed from the Azure Stack Hub user portal.
