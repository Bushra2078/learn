Interfaces allow you to define how a class will interact with the rest of an application. You can create an interface even if the actual class isn't fully implemented, which allows other developers to use uniform functionality right away.

Suppose you are a developer on a large application with multiple developers. If uncoordinated, developers might end up creating redundant code, or accidentally introducing complicated bugs. Establishing code standards and using interfaces can help keep developers on the same page to quickly develop efficient, bug-free code.

Although it is possible to build an object-oriented application without using interfaces, it's best practice to define interfaces in your application when applicable. In this module, you'll learn how interfaces improve your project by reducing code dependencies and standardizing your code.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand how interfaces reduce code dependencies
- Identify how interfaces standardize code
- Understand tightly coupled code
- Learn to plan code design for changes to project scope

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Community installed
- A GitHub account to clone code repositories
- Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio IDE and project structure
- Basic understanding of the C# programming language
- Familiarity with classes, abstract classes, and inheritance
