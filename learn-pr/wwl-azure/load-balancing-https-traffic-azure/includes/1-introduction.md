As an organization migrates infrastructure and applications to Azure, network engineers need to ensure that end users have consistent and reliable access to applications, services, and data.

Azure provides load balancing tools to support the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources. Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single resource. It can also improve availability by sharing a workload across redundant computing resources.

In this module you learn about using Azure Front Door, and Azure Application Gateway load balancing services.

## Learning objectives

 -  Design and implement Azure Application Gateway
 -  Implement Azure Front Door

## Prerequisites

 -  You should have experience with networking concepts, such as IP addressing, Domain Name System (DNS), and routing
 -  You should have experience with network connectivity methods, such as VPN or WAN
