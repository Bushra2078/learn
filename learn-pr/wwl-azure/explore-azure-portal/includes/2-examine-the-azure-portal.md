The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription using a graphical user interface. You can build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments. Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources. Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

## Azure portal menu<br>

You can choose the default mode for the portal menu. It can be docked or it can act as a flyout panel.

When the portal menu is in flyout mode, it's hidden until you need it. Select the menu icon to open or close the menu.

## Azure Home and Azure Dashboards<br>

As a new subscriber to Azure services, the first thing you see after you sign in to the portal is Azure Home. This page compiles resources that help you get the most from your Azure subscription. We include links to free online courses, documentation, core services, and useful sites for staying current and managing change for your organization. For quick and easy access to work in progress, we also show a list of your most recently visited resources.

You can't customize the Home page, but you can choose whether to see Home or Dashboard as your default view. The first time you sign in, there's a prompt at the top of the page where you can save your preference. You can change your startup page selection at any time in Portal settings.

Dashboards provide a focused view of the resources in your subscription that matter most to you. There is a default dashboard that you can use to get started. You can customize this dashboard to bring the resources you use frequently into a single view. Any changes you make to the default view affect your experience only. However, you can create more dashboards for your own use, or publish your customized dashboards and share them with other users in your organization. As noted above, you can set your startup page to Dashboard if you want to see your most recently used dashboard when you sign in to the Azure portal.

## Azure portal shell<br>

The Azure portal menu and page header are global elements that are always present. These persistent features are the "shell" for the user interface associated with each individual service or feature and the header provides access to global controls. When an Azure service is opened in the shell, the configuration page (sometimes referred to as a "blade") for the resource typically displays a resource menu to help you move between features of the service.<br>
