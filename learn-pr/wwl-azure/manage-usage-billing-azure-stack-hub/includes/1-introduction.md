Azure Stack Hub collects and groups usage data for resources that are used, then forwards this data to Azure Commerce. Azure Commerce bills you for Azure Stack Hub usage in the same way it bills you for Azure usage.

Each resource provider in Azure Stack Hub posts usage data per resource usage. The usage service periodically (hourly and daily) aggregates usage data and stores it in the usage database. Azure Stack Hub operators and users can access the stored usage data through the Azure Stack Hub resource usage APIs.
