## Lab scenario

Your organization will be using Azure AD authentication. You've been tasked with provisioning the required user and group accounts. Membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on the user job titles. You also need to invite guest users from another tenant. These guest users should have only limited permissions to resources in your subscription.

Your organization has these specific requirements: 

+ Any user with the Cloud Administrator job title should be assigned to the IT Cloud Administrator group.
+ Any user with the System Administrator job title should be assigned to the IT System Administrator group. 
+ Any user that is a member of the IT Cloud Administrator group or the IT System Administrator group should be assigned to the IT Lab Administrator group.
+ A System Administrator in another Active Directory tenant should be invited as guest user with limited permissions.
