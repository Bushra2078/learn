Things to consider when managing users:

 -  User profile (picture, job, contact info) is optional.
 -  Deleted users can be restored for 30 days.
 -  Sign in and audit log information is available.

> [!NOTE]
> Users can also be added to Azure AD through Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Microsoft Intune admin console, and the CLI.
