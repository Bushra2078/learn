 -  **Update often and right before pushing to avoid merge conflicts**.
 -  **Verify your code change before pushing it to a repository**; ensure it compiles and tests are passing.
 -  **Pay close attention to commit messages, as it will tell you why a change was made**. Consider committing messages as a mini form of documentation for the change.
 -  **Link code changes to work items**. It will concretely link what was created to why it was createdâ€”or modified by providing traceability across requirements and code changes.
 -  **No matter your background or preferences, be a team player and follow agreed conventions and workflows**. Consistency is essential and helps ensure quality, making it easier for team members to pick up where you left off, review your code, debug, and so on.
