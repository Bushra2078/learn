  title: "Check your knowledge."
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following choices is not a benefit of source control?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reusability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Benefits include reusability, traceability, manageability, efficiency, collaboration, learning, creating workflows, working with versions, maintaining the history of changes, and automating tasks."
    - content: "Collaboration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Benefits include reusability, traceability, manageability, efficiency, collaboration, learning, creating workflows, working with versions, maintaining the history of changes, and automating tasks."
    - content: "Manageability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Benefits include reusability, traceability, manageability, efficiency, collaboration, learning, creating workflows, working with versions, maintaining the history of changes, and automating tasks."
    - content: "Efficiency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Benefits include reusability, traceability, manageability, efficiency, collaboration, learning, creating workflows, working with versions, maintaining the history of changes, and automating tasks."
    - content: "Accountability"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Benefits include reusability, traceability, manageability, efficiency, collaboration, learning, creating workflows, working with versions, maintaining the history of changes, and automating tasks."
    - content: "Traceability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Benefits include reusability, traceability, manageability, efficiency, collaboration, learning, creating workflows, working with versions, maintaining the history of changes, and automating tasks."
    - content: "Automate Tasks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Source control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Benefits include reusability, traceability, manageability, efficiency, collaboration, learning, creating workflows, working with versions, maintaining the history of changes, and automating tasks."
  - content: "True or false: Commit personal and secure files is a source control best practice."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Do not commit personal or secure files. These could include application settings or SSH keys. Often these are committed accidentally but cause problems later when other team members are working on the same code."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Do not commit personal or secure files. These could include application settings or SSH keys. Often these are committed accidentally but cause problems later when other team members are working on the same code."
  - content: "Which of the following choices correctly describes one of the most valuable version control features?"
    choices:
    - content: "Version control is a solution for managing and saving changes made to manually created assets. If you make changes to the source code, you can go back in time and easily roll back to previous working versions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Version control tools allow you to see who made changes, when, and what exactly was changed, allowing you to revert it when needed."
    - content: "Version control is a solution for managing and saving changes made to manually created assets. If you make changes to the source code, be careful, you cannot go back in time and easily roll back to previous working versions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Version control tools allow you to see who made changes, when, and what exactly was changed, allowing you to revert it when needed."
