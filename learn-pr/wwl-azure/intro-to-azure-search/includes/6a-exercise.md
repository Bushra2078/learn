Let's imagine you work for Fourth Coffee, a national coffee chain. You're asked to help build a knowledge mining solution that will make it easy to search for insights about customer experiences. You decide to build an Azure Cognitive Search index using data extracted from customer reviews.  

In this lab you'll:  
- Create Azure resources  
- Extract data from a data source 
- Enrich data with AI skills 
- Use Azure's indexer in the Azure portal 
- Query your search index 
- Review results saved to a Knowledge Store

## Azure resources needed 
The solution you'll create for Fourth Coffee requires the following resources in your Azure subscription:

- An **Azure Cognitive Search** resource, which will manage indexing and querying.
- A **Cognitive Services** resource, which provides AI services for skills that your search solution can use to enrich the data in the data source with AI-generated insights.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Your Azure Cognitive Search and Cognitive Services resources must be in the same location!
    
- A **Storage account** with blob containers, which will store raw documents and other collection of tables, objects, or files.

### Create an *Azure Cognitive Search* resource 

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). 

2. Click the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *Azure Cognitive Search*, and create a **Azure Cognitive Search** resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*.
    - **Resource group**: *Select or create a resource group with a unique name*.
    - **Service name**: *A unique name*
    - **Location**: *Choose any available region*
    - **Pricing tier**: Basic

5. Select **Review + create**, and after you see the response **Validation Success**, select **Create**.

6. After deployment completes, select **Go to resource**. On your Azure Cognitive Search resource overview page you have the ability to add indexes, import data, and search created indexes.

### Create a Cognitive Services resource

You'll need to provision a **Cognitive Services** resource that is in the same location as your Azure Cognitive Search resource. Your search solution will use this to enrich the data in the datastore with AI-generated insights.

1. Return to the home page of the Azure portal, and then select the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *Cognitive Services*, and create a **Cognitive Services** resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *The same resource group as your Azure Cognitive Search resource*
    - **Region**: *The same location as your Azure Cognitive Search resource*
    - **Name**: *A unique name*
    - **Pricing tier**: Standard S0
2. Select the required checkboxes and create the resource.
3. Wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.

### Create a storage account

1. Return to the home page of the Azure portal, and then select the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *storage account*, and create a **Storage account** resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *The same resource group as your Azure Cognitive Search and Cognitive Services resources*
    - **Storage account name**: *A unique name*
    - **Location**: *Choose any available location*
    - **Performance**: Standard
    - **Replication**: Locally-redundant storage (LRS)
2. Click **Review + Create** and then click **Create**. Wait for deployment to complete, and then go to the deployed resource.

## Upload Documents to Azure Storage

1. Select **Go to resource** to access the Azure Storage account you just created. Then navigate to the left-hand pane and click on **Containers**.

2. Select **+ Container**. A pane on your right-hand side will open up. 
    ![Screenshot of creating a storage container.](../media/storage-blob-2.png)
    Enter the following settings: 
    - **Name**: coffee-reviews  
    - **Public access level**: Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs)
    - **Advanced**: *no changes*  
    - Click **Create**. 

3. Download the zipped documents from https://aka.ms/km-documents. Then extract the files from *reviews* folder. 
4. Click on your container *coffee-reviews*, then in the container, click **upload**. 
    ![Screenshot of storage container.](../media/storage-blob-3.png)

5. In the right-hand pane, select **all** the files in the *reviews* folder, then click **upload**. Now your documents are in your *coffee-reviews* storage container. 

## Index the documents

Once you have the documents in storage, you can use Azure Cognitive Search to extract insights from the documents.

1. In the Azure portal, browse to your Azure Cognitive Search resource. Then, on its **Overview** page, select **Import data**. The Azure portal provides the *Import data wizard* that enables you to automatically create an index and indexer for supported data sources. You'll use the wizard to create an index, and import your search documents from storage into the Azure Cognitive Search index. Selecting the **Import data** button starts the *Import data wizard*. 
    
    ![Screenshot of import data wizard.](../media/azure-search-wizard-1.png)

2. On the **Connect to your data** page, in the **Data Source** list, select **Azure Blob Storage**. Then complete the data store details with the following values:
    - **Data Source**: *Choose Azure Blob Storage*
    - **Data source name**: coffee-customer-data
    - **Data to extract**: Content and metadata
    - **Parsing mode**: Default
    - **Connection string**: *Select **Choose an existing connection**. Then select your storage account, and finally select the **coffee-reviews** container you created. 
    - **Managed identity authentication**: None
    - **Container name**: *this setting is auto-populated after you choose an existing connection*
    - **Blob folder**: *Leave this blank*
    - **Description**: Reviews for Fourth Coffee shops.
3. Proceed to the next step (*Add cognitive skills (Optional)*).
4. In the **Attach Cognitive Services** section, select your Cognitive Services resource that is in the same location as your Cognitive Search resource.  
5. In the **Add enrichments** section:
    - Change the **Skillset name** to **coffee-skillset**.
    - Select the option **Enable OCR and merge all text into merged_content field**.
        > [!NOTE]
        > It is important to select **Enable OCR** in order to see all of the enriched field options. 
    - Ensure that the **Source data field** is set to **merged_content**.
    - Change the **Enrichment granularity level** to **Pages (5000 character chunks)**. 
    - Select the following enriched fields:

        | Cognitive Skill | Parameter | Field name |
        | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
        | Extract location names | | locations |
        | Extract key phrases | | keyphrases |
        | Detect Sentiment | | sentiment |
        | Generate tags from images | | imageTags |
        | Generate captions from images | | imageCaption |
        

Double-check your selections (it can be difficult to change them later). 
6. Under **Save Enrichments to a Knowledge Store**, select the boxes: 
    - Image projections 
    - Documents
    - Key phrases 
    - Image details
    - Image references
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > A warning asking for a **Storage Account Connection String** will appear. 

7. Click on **Choose and existing connection**. Choose the storage account you created earlier, then create a new container called **knowledge-store** with the privacy level set to private. Then click *Select* at the bottom of the screen.
8. Select **Azure blob projects: Document**. A setting for *Container name* with the *knowledge-store* container auto-populated will appear. Keep the container name as-is. 
9. Click **Next, Customize Target Index**. Change the **Index name** to **coffee-index**.
10. Ensure that the **Key** is set to **metadata_storage_path** and leave the **Suggester name** blank and the **Search mode** autopopulated.
11. Review the index fields with their default settings. Additionally check off **filter** for all the fields that are already selected. Proceed to the next step (*Create an indexer*).
12. Change the **Indexer name** to **coffee-indexer**.
13. Leave the **Schedule** set to **Once**.
14. Expand the **Advanced** options, and ensure that the **Base-64 encode keys** option is selected (generally encoding keys make the index more efficient).
15. Select **Submit** to create the data source, skillset, index, and indexer. The indexer is run automatically and runs the indexing pipeline, which:
    1. Extracts the document metadata fields and content from the data source
    2. Runs the skillset of cognitive skills to generate additional enriched fields
    3. Maps the extracted fields to the index
16. In the bottom half of the **Overview** page for your Azure Cognitive Search resource, view the **Indexers** tab, which should show the newly created **coffee-indexer**. Wait a minute, and click **&orarr; Refresh** until the **Status** indicates success.

## Query the index

You'll use the Search explorer to write and test queries. Search explorer is a tool built into the Azure portal that gives you an easy way to validate the quality of your search index. You can use Search explorer to write queries and review results in JSON.

1. In your Search service's *Overview* page, select **Search explorer** at the top of the screen. 

   ![Screenshot of how to find Search explorer.](../media/5-exercise-screenshot-7.png)

2. Notice how the index selected is the *coffee-index* you just created. 

    ![Screenshot of the Search explorer.](../media/search-explorer-query.png)

    In the **Query string** field, enter `search=*&$count=true`, and then select **Search**. The search query returns all the documents in the search index, including a count of all the documents in the **@odata.count** field. The search index should return a JSON document containing your search results. 

3. Now let's filter by location. Enter `search=$filter=locations eq 'Chicago'`. The query searches all the documents in the  index and filters for reviews with a Chicago location.

4. Now let's filter by sentiment. Enter `search=$filter=sentiment eq 'negative'` in the **Query string** field, and then select **Search**. The query searches all the documents in the index and filters for reviews with a negative sentiment.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > See how the results are sorted by `@search.score`. This is the score assigned by the search engine to show how closely the results match the given query. 

5. One of the problems we may want to solve for is why there might be certain reviews. Let's take a look at the key phrases associated with the negative review. What do you think may be the cause of the review?

## Review the knowledge store 

Finally let's see the power of the knowledge store in action. When you ran the *Import data wizard*, you also created a knowledge store. Inside the knowledge store you'll find the enriched data extracted by AI skills persisted in the form of projections and tables.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to your Azure storage account. 
2. On the left-hand pane, click on **Storage browser (preview)**. In the storage browser tree click on **Blob containers**. Select the container you labeled **knowledge-store**. 
3. Click on any of the items, and then click on the **objectprojection.json** file. 
   
    ![Screenshot of the objectprojection.json.](../media/knowledge-store-blob-1.png)

4. Click **Edit** to see the JSON produced for one of the documents from your Azure data store. 
   
    ![Screenshot of how to find the edit button.](../media/knowledge-store-blob-2.png)

5. Return back to the Storage browser's tree by clicking on the storage blob breadcrumb at the top left of the screen. 
   
    ![Screenshot of the storage blob breadcrumb.](../media/knowledge-store-blob-4.png)

6. Now click on **Blob containers** on the left-hand panel again. Select the container *coffee-skillset-image-projection*. Click on any of the items. 
    
    ![Screenshot of the skillset container.](../media/knowledge-store-blob-5.png)

7. Click on any of the files. Click **Edit** to see the image stored from the document. Notice how all the images from the documents are stored in this manner. 
    
    ![Screenshot of the image saved.](../media/knowledge-store-blob-3.png)

8. Return back to the Storage browser's tree by clicking on the storage blob breadcrumb at the top left of the screen. 
9. Now click on **Tables** on the left-hand panel. There's a table for each entity in the index. Select the table ending with *KeyPhrases*. Take a look at the key phrases that the knowledge store was able to capture from the content in the reviews. Many of the fields are keys (so you can link the tables like a relational database); but that the last field shows the key phrases that were extracted by the skillset.
