Every day we rely on search engines to find information quickly. Search engines are able to return results because they have content stored in a database known as an index. 

Azure Cognitive Search is a private, enterprise, search solution that allows you to build a single fast index for content. The index can then be used for internal only use, or to enable searchable content on your public facing internet assets.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Explore Azure Cognitive Search
- Understand index schema and methods to load data into an index
- Create an index in the Azure portal using the Import data wizard 
- Query an index with Search explorer
