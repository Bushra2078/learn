  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which one of the following statements about query requests is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "All query composition is based on the full Lucene syntax."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cognitive Search provides a simple syntax as the default. The optional full Lucene syntax is used for more advanced queries such as fuzzy search, proximity search, and regular expressions."
    - content: "Query requests include search criteria, but nothing for shaping search results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A query request is a comprehensive instruction to the search engine. A single call can combine a search expression, a $filter expression, pagination, which fields to search, and which fields to return."
    - content: "Search explorer returns results in JSON only."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Search explorer returns results in JSON only."
    - content: "SearchMode must be set to ON in order for queries to work."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Valid values are \"any\" or \"all\". The searchMode specifies whether a positive match can be made using any of the criteria, or whether all of the criteria must be satisfied."
  - content: "Which of the following data sources can be used as an input data source?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Lake."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Data Lake is not a supported external data source. It is, however, entirely possible to write code to use the REST API, and push data from Azure Data Lake to Azure Cognitive Search."
    - content: "Azure Virtual Machines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Virtual Machines are not a supported data source. SQL Server installed on a virtual machine is a supported source however."
    - content: "Azure SQL Database."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure SQL Database is one of the supported external data sources in Azure Cognitive Search. Azure SQL Database has a built-in indexer ready made for Azure Cognitive Search."
    - content: "Azure Queue Storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Queue Storage is not supported. Only Blob and Table Storage are supported external sources within Azure Storage."
  - content: "Which data format is accepted by Azure Cognitive Search when you are pushing data to the service?"
    choices:
    - content: "CSV."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. CSV isn't supported."
    - content: "SQL."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SQL isn't supported."
    - content: "XML."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. XML isn't supported."
    - content: "JSON."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Documents are stored in the search index as JSON documents. JSON is also used to define index schemas, indexers, and data source objects."
