  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which data format is accepted by Azure Cognitive Search when you are pushing data to the index?"
    choices:
    - content: "CSV."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your Azure Storage blob can contain all types of files, but CSV isn't supported for the Search index."
    - content: "SQL."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SQL isn't supported."
    - content: "JSON."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Documents are imported as JSON documents. JSON is also used to define index schemas, indexers, and data source objects."
  - content: "Which explanation best describes an indexer and an index?"
    choices:
    - content: "An indexer converts documents into JSON and forwards them to a search engine for indexing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An indexer serializes a source document into JSON before passing it to a search engine for indexing. An indexer automates several steps of data ingestion, reducing the amount of code you need to write."
    - content: "An indexer can be used instead of an index if the files are already in the proper format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An indexer is used to populate an index, but isn't a replacement for an index."
    - content: "An indexer is only used for AI enrichment and skillset execution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A skillset requires an indexer, but an indexer doesn't require a skillset. You can use indexers to create a search index from textual content in any supported data source."
  - content: "If you set up a search index without including a skillset, which would you still be able to query?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sentiment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Detecting the sentiment in content requires a skillset that includes the Sentiment Analysis skill."
    - content: "Text content."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cognitive Search is used for full text search over indexes containing alphanumeric content."
    - content: "Image captions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating captions for images requires a skillset that includes the Image Analysis skill"
