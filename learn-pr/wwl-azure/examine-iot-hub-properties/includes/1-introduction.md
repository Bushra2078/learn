Azure IoT Hub can be configured to support large or small IoT solutions with a range of data processing requirements.

Suppose you have joined a team that will be implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Planning documents indicate the expected number of devices and the quantity/rate of telemetry data that will be generated, both of which affect how the solution should be configured. Ensuring that IoT Hub is configured properly requires the team understand how these and other factors affect the intended solution. To begin, you decide to examine the properties of IoT Hub that relate to scaling, downstream communication, and security.<br>

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine the service tiers available for IoT Hub.<br>
 -  Examine the IoT Hub endpoints that are available for communication with other resources.
 -  Examine the security features that IoT Hub uses to help protect your solution.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the configuration requirements for IoT Hub that impact data communication.
