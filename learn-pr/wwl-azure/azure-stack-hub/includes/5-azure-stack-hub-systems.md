With Azure Stack Hub, you can deploy and operate both IaaS and PaaS by using the same tools and offering the same experience as the Azure public cloud. Management of Azure Stack, whether through the web UI portal or through PowerShell, has a consistent look and feel for IT administrators and end users with Azure.

Azure Stack Hub is offered via two deployment options:

 -  **Azure Stack integrated systems**: Azure Stack Hub integrated systems are offered through Microsoft and hardware partners to create a solution that provides cloud-paced innovation balanced with simple management. Because Azure Stack is offered as an integrated system of hardware and software, you get flexibility and control while still adopting innovation from the cloud. Azure Stack integrated systems range in size from 4 to 12 nodes. They're jointly supported by the hardware partner and Microsoft. Use Azure Stack integrated systems to enable new scenarios for your production workloads.
 -  **Azure Stack Development Kit**: The Microsoft Azure Stack Development Kit is a single-node deployment of Azure Stack. You can use it to evaluate and learn about Azure Stack. You can also use the kit as a developer environment, where you can develop by using APIs and tooling that is consistent with Azure. The Azure Stack Development Kit is not intended for use as a production environment.

## Integrated systems

Azure Stack Hub integrated systems are offered through a partnership of Microsoft and hardware partners, creating a solution that offers cloud-paced innovation and computing management simplicity. Because Azure Stack Hub is offered as an integrated hardware and software system, you have the flexibility and control you need, along with the ability to innovate from the cloud.

An Azure Stack Hub integrated system can range in size from 4-16 servers, called a scale unit. Integrated systems are jointly supported by the hardware partner and Microsoft. The following diagram shows an example of a scale unit.
