Azure and Azure Stack Hub unlock new hybrid cloud use cases for both customer-facing and internal line-of-business apps. Azure Stack Hub allows you to deploy a subset of IaaS and PaaS services available in the Azure public cloud into your own datacenter or in a datacenter managed by a service provider. These services include virtual machines, App Service web apps, API apps, and functions, SQL and MySQL databases, containers, Event Hubs, IoT Hubs, Service Fabric clusters, and Kubernetes clusters.

In this module, you will learn how Azure Stack Hub is an extension of Azure that provides a way to run apps in an on-premises environment and deliver Azure services in your datacenter.

This module aligns with the exam AZ-600: Configuring and Operating a Hybrid Cloud with Microsoft Azure Stack Hub.
