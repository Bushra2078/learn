  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer has detected instances when telemetry is not being received by IoT Hub. The issue always occurs during peak business periods. It appears that devices are connected to IoT hub when this issue occurs. Which of the following statements about message throttling is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "The IoT Hub tier edition (1-3) determines the throttling limits that IoT Hub enforces on all operations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. IoT Hub tier edition determines the throttling limits. For example, an S2 IoT Hub will have higher throttling limits than an S1 IoT Hub."
    - content: "All messaging attempts in excess of throttle limits are queued and eventually received."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Messages that exceed the throttling limit are queued, but not in an unlimited fashion and some messages could be lost."
    - content: "IoT Hub caches incoming messages for later retrieval if the number of queued messages exceeds the queue size limit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IoT Hub will queue messages in excess of the throttle limit, but once the queue size limit is exceeded, errors are generated and the messages are lost."
  - content: "A developer wants to track the total number of devices that are connected to IoT Hub. They also want to track the percentage of deployed devices that are connected at any given time. What is the correct way to check the connected/disconnected state of a device?"
    choices:
    - content: "Query the connectionState field of the IoT Hub identity registry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Only use the connectionState field during development and debugging. IoT solutions should not query the field at run time."
    - content: "Maintain a record of the last message received from each device."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If your IoT solution needs to know if a device is connected, you can maintain a record of \"heartbeat messages\" from the device to evaluate whether the device is currently connected."
    - content: "Use device twin desired and reported properties that can be used to track connection state."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using device twin desired and reported properties to determine the connection status of a device is not recommended."
