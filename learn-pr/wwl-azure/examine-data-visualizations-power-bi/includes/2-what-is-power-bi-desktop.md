Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover important insights, and then share reports with anyone or everyone you want.

## The parts of Power BI

Power BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:

 -  A Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.
 -  An online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.
 -  Power BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.

## Power BI service

The Microsoft Power BI service (app.powerbi.com), sometimes referred to as Power BI online, is the SaaS (Software as a Service) part of Power BI. In the Power BI service, dashboards help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business. Dashboards display tiles, which you can select to open reports for exploring further. Dashboards and reports connect to datasets that bring all of the relevant data together in one place.

## Power BI Desktop

Power BI Desktop is a free application you can install on your local computer that lets you connect to, transform, and visualize your data. With Power BI Desktop, you can connect to multiple different sources of data, and combine them (often called modeling) into a data model that lets you build visuals, and collections of visuals you can share as reports, with other people inside your organization. Most users who work on Business Intelligence projects use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then use the Power BI service to share their reports with others.

The most common uses for Power BI Desktop are the following:

 -  Connect to data.
 -  Transform and clean that data, to create a data model.
 -  Create visuals, such as charts or graphs, that provide visual representations of the data.
 -  Create reports that are collections of visuals, on one or more report pages.
 -  Share reports with others using the Power BI service.

## Views in Power BI Desktop

There are three views in Power BI Desktop, shown along the left side of the canvas. The views, shown in the order they appear, are the following:

 -  Report View - this is where you create reports and visuals, and where most of your creation time is spent.
 -  Data View - here you can see the tables, measures, and other data used in the data model associated with your report, and transform the data for best use in the report's model.
 -  Model View - in this view you see and manage the relationships among tables in your data model.

## Connect to data

To get started with Power BI Desktop, the first step is to connect to data. There are many different data sources you can connect to from Power BI Desktop. To connect to data, simply select the Home ribbon, then select Get Data &gt; More.

## Transform and clean data, create a model

In Power BI Desktop, you can clean and transform data using the built-in Query Editor. With Query Editor you can make changes to your data, such as changing a data type, removing columns, or combining data from multiple sources. It's a little bit like sculpting - you can start with a large block of clay (or data), then shave pieces off or add others as needed, until the shape of the data is how you want it.

## Create visuals

Once you have a data model, you can drag fields onto the report canvas to create visuals. A visual is a graphic representation of the data in your model.

## Create reports

More often, you'll want to create a collection of visuals that show various aspects of the data you have used to create your model in Power BI Desktop. A collection of visuals, in one Power BI Desktop file, is called a report. A report can have one or more pages, just like an Excel file can have one or more worksheets. In the following image you see the first page of a Power BI Desktop report, named Overview (you can see the tab near the bottom of the image). In this report, there are ten pages.

## Share reports

Once a report is ready to share with others, you can Publish the report to the Power BI service, and make it available to anyone in your organization who has a Power BI license. To publish a Power BI Desktop report, you select the Publish button from the Home ribbon in Power BI Desktop.
