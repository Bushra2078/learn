  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of Microsoft Defender for Servers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provides advanced defenses only for Windows machines in Azure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Defender for Servers provides advanced defenses for both Windows and Linux machines in Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises environments."
    - content: "Enables the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes a different feature. Microsoft Defender for Servers includes security baselines and OS level assessments, vulnerability assessment scanning, adaptive application controls (AAC), file integrity monitoring (FIM), and more."
    - content: "Brings threat detection and advanced defenses to Windows and Linux machines that run in Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises environments"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Microsoft Defender for Servers provides threat detection and advanced defenses to both Windows and Linux machines in various environments, including Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises."
  - content: "What does Defender for Cloud do with the vulnerabilities identified by the vulnerability assessment tool?"
    choices:
    - content: "Defender for Cloud ignores the vulnerabilities and does not present any recommendations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Defender for Cloud presents the findings and related information as recommendations."
    - content: "Defender for Cloud only presents the vulnerabilities for a specific VM, not for all VMs in the currently selected subscriptions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Defender for Cloud shows you all the findings for all VMs in the currently selected subscriptions."
    - content: "Defender for Cloud presents the findings and related information as recommendations, including remediation steps, relevant CVEs, CVSS scores, and more."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Defender for Cloud presents the findings and related information as recommendations, including remediation steps, relevant CVEs, CVSS scores, and more."
  - content: "What does Defender for Cloud use to identify threats?"
    choices:
    - content: "Behavioral analytics that depends on known patterns derived from large data sets"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Behavioral analytics is not used for anomaly detection."
    - content: "Exporting alerts to CSV reports"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exporting alerts is a way to view alerts outside of Defender for Cloud, but it is not used for identifying threats."
    - content: "Anomaly detection"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Anomaly detection is used to identify threats by determining normal activity for your deployments and then generating rules to define outlier conditions that could represent a security event."
  - content: "A security analyst needs to view vulnerability assessment findings for a specific virtual machine. What steps should they follow in Defender for Cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Open the Recommendations page and select the recommendation 'Machines should have all security issues resolved'."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This recommendation shows all security issues for all VMs in the selected subscriptions, not just for a specific VM."
    - content: "Create a disable rule for the specific finding."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a disable rule is an optional step if the organization needs to ignore a finding, rather than remediate it."
    - content: "Open the Recommendations page, select the recommendation 'Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved', and filter the findings by the specific VM of interest."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This will show the findings for the specific VM, ordered by severity. The details pane for each finding contains extensive information about the vulnerability, including links to relevant CVEs, remediation steps, and any additional reference pages."
  - content: "A security analyst needs to prioritize alerts in Defender for Cloud. How are alerts classified?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alerts are classified based on the resource type they are triggered on."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Defender for Cloud classifies alerts based on severity, not resource type."
    - content: "Alerts are classified based on the time they were triggered."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Defender for Cloud classifies alerts based on severity, not time."
    - content: "Alerts are classified based on severity, which is determined by the specific trigger and the confidence level of malicious intent."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Defender for Cloud assigns a severity level to each alert based on the specific trigger and the confidence level of malicious intent. This helps prioritize how to attend to each alert."
