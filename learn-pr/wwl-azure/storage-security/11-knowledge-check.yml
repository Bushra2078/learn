  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "There is a need to provide a contingent staff employee temporary read-only access to the contents of an Azure storage account container named “Media”. It is important to grant access while adhering to the security principle of least-privilege. What should be configured?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set the public access level to container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Don't lower the security of container storage by granting public access."
    - content: "Generate a shared access signature (SAS) token for the container."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Generate a SAS token for the container. The SAS can provide read-only access."
    - content: "Share the container entity tag (Etag) with the contingent staff member."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An access token is required in the scenario, not an Etag."
  - content: "A company has both a development and production environment. The development environment needs time-limited access to storage. The production environment needs unrestricted access to storage resources. To configure storage access to meet the requirements, what configuration choices should be done?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use shared access signatures for the development apps. And use access keys for the production apps."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Shared access signatures provide a way to provide more granular storage access than access keys. For example, limit access to “read only” and then limit the services and types of resources. Shared access signatures can be configured for a specified amount of time, which meets the scenario’s requirements. Access keys provide unrestricted access to the storage resources, which is the requirement for production apps in this scenario."
    - content: "Use shared access signatures for the production apps. Then, use access keys for the development apps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This solution would not provide the time-limited access to the development apps."
    - content: "Use Stored Access Policies for the production apps. Also, use Cross Origin Resource Sharing for the development apps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cross Origin Resource Sharing does not help with restricting the time limit of the development apps."
  - content: "A company is being audited. It is not known how long the audit will take, but during that time files must not be changed or removed. It is okay to read or create new files. What should be done to set this up?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add a time-based retention policy to the blob container. And create a tag to identify items being protected."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using a tag to identify items is a good idea, but a time-based retention policy does not work in this situation."
    - content: "Add legal hold retention policy to the blob container. Also, identify a tag for the items that are being protected."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Add legal hold retention policy to the blob container. Identify a tag for the items that are being protected. If the retention interval is not known, users can set legal holds to store immutable data until the legal hold is cleared. When a legal hold policy is set, blobs can be created and read, but not modified or deleted. Each legal hold is associated with a user-defined alphanumeric tag (such as a case ID, event name, etc.) that is used as an identifier string."
    - content: "Configure a retention time period of two weeks with an option to renew. Then, add a time-based retention policy to the blob container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A retention policy would only ensure files are not deleted, they could still be modified."
  - content: "Which statements are factual when configuring an Azure file share for a business group?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Files can authenticate to Azure Active Directory Domain Services."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Files can authenticate with Azure AD."
    - content: "Azure Files cannot authenticate to on-premises Active Directory Domain Services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Files can authenticate to an on-premises Azure AD Domain Service"
    - content: "Azure Files can use RBAC for share-level or directory/file permissions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Files cannot use RBAC for share-level or directory/file permissions. Only share-level permissions can use RBAC. Directory or file level permissions can use Windows DACLs, or not."
  - content: "When configuring Secure transfer, the Compliance office wants to understand how connections are secured when REST API operational calls are made to an Azure Storage account. What information would be provided?"
    choices:
    - content: "Requests to storage can be HTTPS or HTTP."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Requests to storage can be HTTPS or HTTP. When Secure transfer required is enabled all requests must be HTTPS."
    - content: "Requests to storage must be SMB with data access flag enabled."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data access is not a valid flag, it is required that storage requests are encrypted."
    - content: "By default, new storage accounts have secure transfer required enabled."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To help protect data, secure transfer is enabled by default on new storage accounts."
