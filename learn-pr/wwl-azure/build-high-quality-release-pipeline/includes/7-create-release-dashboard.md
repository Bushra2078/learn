**Estimated time:** 45 minutes.

**Lab files:** none.

## Scenario

In this lab, you'll step through creating a release dashboard and using REST API to retrieve Azure DevOps release data, which you can make available to your custom applications or dashboards.

The lab uses the Azure DevOps Starter resource, which automatically creates an Azure DevOps project that builds and deploys an application into Azure.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

 -  Create a release dashboard.
 -  Use REST API to query release information.

## Requirements

 -  This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps-supported browser](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).
 -  **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
 -  Identify an existing Azure subscription or create a new one.
 -  Verify that you have a Microsoft account or an Azure AD account with the Contributor or the Owner role in the Azure subscription. For details, refer to [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

## Exercises

During this lab, you'll complete the following exercises:

 -  Exercise 1: Create a release dashboard.
 -  Exercise 2: Query release information via REST API.
 -  Exercise 3: Remove the Azure lab resources.
