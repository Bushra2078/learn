  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An administrator is tasked with managing and configuring settings for computers and users within a specific department. They decide to consolidate these objects for easier management. What should the administrator create to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Group Policy Object (GPO)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While GPOs are used to manage and configure settings, they are not used to consolidate objects."
    - content: "A Domain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A domain is a logical group of network objects, but it is not specifically used to consolidate objects for easier management."
    - content: "An Organizational Unit (OU)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An OU is a container object within a domain that can be used to consolidate users, computers, groups, and other objects for easier management."
  - content: "An administrator needs to move multiple user accounts to a specific organizational unit (OU) for centralized control and uniform policy enforcement. After moving the accounts, they need to be disabled temporarily. What should the administrator do to accomplish this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Windows PowerShell to manually move each account to the OU and then disable them individually."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While PowerShell can be used, the task doesn't require moving and disabling accounts individually which is time-consuming."
    - content: "Use Active Directory Administrative Center to move the accounts to the OU, but leave them enabled."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This doesn't fulfill the requirement of disabling the accounts after moving them to the OU."
    - content: "Use Active Directory Administrative Center to move the accounts to the OU and then disable all selected accounts."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This method allows for bulk management of accounts, saving time and reducing potential for error."
  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with managing service accounts for various applications running on multiple servers. The administrator wants to simplify password management and SPN management. What should the administrator use to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "User accounts in AD DS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User accounts in AD DS are used for user authentication and access control, not for managing service accounts."
    - content: "Local System accounts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Local System accounts are local to the computer and do not provide centralized administration or simplified password and SPN management."
    - content: "Group managed service accounts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Group managed service accounts provide automatic password maintenance and simplified SPN management for services running on multiple servers."
  - content: "A system administrator needs to manage a collection of users, computers, contacts, and other groups as a single entity in Active Directory. What should the administrator do to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a new user account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a new user account provides an individual with access permissions and resources, but it does not allow for managing a collection of users and resources as a single entity."
    - content: "Create an Organizational Unit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While creating an Organizational Unit provides a hierarchical framework for organizing objects, it does not directly allow for managing a collection of users and resources as a single entity."
    - content: "Create a new group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Creating a group in Active Directory allows for managing a collection of users, computers, contacts, and other groups as a single entity."
