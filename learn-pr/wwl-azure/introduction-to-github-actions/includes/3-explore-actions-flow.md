GitHub tracks events that occur. Events can trigger the start of workflows.

Workflows can also start on cron-based schedules and can be triggered by events outside of GitHub.

They can be manually triggered.

Workflows are the unit of automation. They contain Jobs.

Jobs use Actions to get work done.
