## Multiple Choice
Your company is building a video-editing application that will offer online storage for user-generated video content. The videos will be stored in Azure Blobs. An Azure storage account will contain the blobs. It is unlikely the storage account would ever need to be removed and recreated because this would delete all the user videos. Which tool is likely to offer the quickest and easiest way to create the storage account?
(x) Azure portal {{That's correct. The portal is a good choice for one-off operations like creating a long-lived storage account. The portal provides a GUI containing all the storage-account properties and provides tool tips to help select the right options for your needs.}}
( ) Azure CLI {{That's incorrect. To use the CLI, would first require researching the command to create a storage account. Then either install the CLI locally or login to the Cloud Shell. For a one-off operation like creating a storage account, this is likely to take longer than using the Azure portal.}}
( ) Azure PowerShell {{That's incorrect. To use Azure PowerShell, would first require researching the command to create a storage account. Then either install PowerShell locally or login to the Cloud Shell. For a one-off operation like creating a storage account, this is likely to take longer than using the Azure portal.}}

## Multiple Choice
The Azure CLI can be installed on which of the following?
( ) Linux {{That's incorrect, other platforms are available. }}
( ) Windows {{That's incorrect, other platforms are available. }}
(x) Both Linux and Windows {{That's correct. The CLI is cross-platform and can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. After installation, the CLI commands are the same on every platform. This means commands learned once can be used with any local installation or in the Azure Cloud Shell.}}

## Multiple Choice
Another Administrator is managing Azure locally using PowerShell. They have launched PowerShell as an Administrator. Which of the following commands should be executed first?
(x) Connect-AzAccount {{That's correct. So, the first thing to do is to connect to Azure and provide your credentials.}}
( ) Get-AzResourceGroup {{That's incorrect. This would not be the first command. The Get-AzResourceGroup cmdlet gets Azure resource groups in the current subscription.}}
( ) Get-AzSubscription {{That's incorrect. This would not be the first command. The Get-AzSubscription cmdlet gets the subscription ID, subscription name, and home tenant for subscriptions that the current account can access.}}
