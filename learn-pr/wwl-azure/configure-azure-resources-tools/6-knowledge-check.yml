  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your company is building a video-editing application that will offer online storage for user-generated video content. The videos will be stored in Azure Blobs. An Azure storage account will contain the blobs. It is unlikely the storage account would ever need to be removed and recreated because this would delete all the user videos. Which tool is likely to offer the quickest and easiest way to create the storage account?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure portal"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The portal is a good choice for one-off operations like creating a long-lived storage account. The portal gives you a GUI containing all the storage-account properties and provides tool tips to help you select the right options for your needs."
    - content: "Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To use the CLI, you would need to research the command used to create a storage account. You would also need to either install the CLI locally or login to the cloud shell. For a one-off operation like creating a storage account, this is likely to take longer than using the Azure portal."
    - content: "Azure PowerShell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To use Azure PowerShell, you would need to research the command used to create a storage account. You would also need to either install PowerShell and Azure PowerShell locally or login to the cloud shell. For a one-off operation like creating a storage account, this is likely to take longer than using the Azure portal."
  - content: "The Azure CLI can be installed on ..."
    choices:
    - content: "Linux"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect, other platforms are available."
    - content: "Windows"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect, other platforms are available."
    - content: "Both Linux and Windows"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The CLI is cross-platform and can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. After installation, the CLI commands that you run are the same everywhere. This means you can learn the commands once and use them with any local installation or in the Azure Cloud Shell."
  - content: "Another Administrator is managing Azure locally using PowerShell. They have launched PowerShell as an Administrator. Which of the following commands should be executed first?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect-AzAccount"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When you are working locally you are not automatically logged in to Azure. So, the first thing you should do is to connect to Azure and provide your credentials."
    - content: "Get-AzResourceGroup"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This would not be the first command. The Get-AzResourceGroup cmdlet gets Azure resource groups in the current subscription."
    - content: "Get-AzSubscription"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This would not be the first command. The Get-AzSubscription cmdlet gets the subscription ID, subscription name, and home tenant for subscriptions that the current account can access."
