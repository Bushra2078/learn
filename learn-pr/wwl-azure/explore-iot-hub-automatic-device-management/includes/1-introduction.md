IoT Hub automatic device management can be used to implement bulk management of IoT devices.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to manage the devices that have been deployed as part of the company's IoT solution. You decide to gain experience automating the management of groups of devices by implementing IoT Hub automatic device management in a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:

 -  Write code for a simulated device that will implement a firmware update.
 -  Test the firmware update process on a single device using Azure IoT Hub automatic device management.

By the end of this module, you will be able to use IoT Hub automatic device management to modify devices within a device group.
