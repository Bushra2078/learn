  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following could require both a password and a phone verification for full authentication?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A firewall filters traffic based on IP-address to / from your cloud applications."
    - content: "Application Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An application gateway manages balanced access directly to your web applications."
    - content: "Multi-Factor Authentication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. MFA can require two or more elements for full authentication."
  - content: "Which of these options helps to easily disable an account when an employee leaves your company?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While MFA provides additional security by requiring two or more elements for full authentication, it doesn't help you disable inactive accounts."
    - content: "Monitor sign-on attempts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While monitoring can help you discover when someone attempts unauthorized access to one of your services, monitoring alone won't help you disable inactive accounts."
    - content: "Use single sign-on (SSO)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. SSO centralizes user identity, so you can disable an inactive account in a single step."
  - content: "Connecting to a secure resource requires both authentication and authorization.  What is the purpose of authentication?"
    choices:
    - content: "To validate that the user logging into the resource is who they say they are with a password, fingerprint, or other mechanism."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Authentication uses things like something you know, something you are, and something you have to verify identity."
    - content: "To validate the specific resources the user has access to. Then grant them a token to allow access to use the resource requested."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is the process of authorization, where a validated user is granted access to resources they can use."
    - content: "To allow the administrator to assign access to a secure resource, to limit the number of users who has access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is assigning access rights.  Authentication is about validating identity."
