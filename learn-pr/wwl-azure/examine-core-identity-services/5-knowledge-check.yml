  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following could require both a password and a security question for full authentication?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A firewall filters traffic based on IP-address to / from your cloud applications."
    - content: "Application Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An application gateway manages balanced access directly to your web applications."
    - content: "Multi-Factor Authentication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. MFA can require two or more elements for full authentication."
  - content: "Which of these options helps to easily disable an account when an employee leaves your company?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While MFA provides additional security by requiring two or more elements for full authentication, it doesn't help you disable inactive accounts."
    - content: "Monitor sign-on attempts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While monitoring can help you discover when someone attempts unauthorized access to one of your services, monitoring alone won't help you disable inactive accounts."
    - content: "Use single sign-on (SSO)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. SSO centralizes user identity, so you can disable an inactive account in a single step."
