  questions:
  - content: "What does Azure DDoS Protection do to provide tailored protection policies for each customer?"
    choices:
    - content: "It applies the same mitigation policies for all customers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would not provide tailored protection policies for each customer."
    - content: "It relies on customers to configure their own protection policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would not provide tailored protection policies for each customer."
    - content: "It automatically learns per customer per Public IP traffic patterns for Layer 3 and 4."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure DDoS Protection uses automatic learning of per customer per Public IP traffic patterns for Layer 3 and 4 to provide tailored protection policies for each customer."
  - content: "A company wants to ensure the security of their web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Which of the following solutions can help them achieve this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Securing each individual web application separately"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This approach can be time-consuming and may not provide centralized protection against common exploits and vulnerabilities."
    - content: "Deploying multiple layers of security within the application code"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This approach can be challenging and require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology."
    - content: "Deploying a centralized Web Application Firewall (WAF)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A WAF provides centralized protection of web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities, making security management simpler and giving application administrators better assurance of protection against threats and intrusions."
  - content: "A company wants to improve the performance and security of their web applications for their global users. They want to use a cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) that can provide fast, reliable, and secure access between their users and their applications. Which Microsoft service can they use to achieve this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Traffic Manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables users to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions."
    - content: "Azure Virtual Network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Virtual Network is a service that allows users to create and manage virtual private networks (VPNs) in Azure."
    - content: "Azure Front Door"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Front Door is Microsoft's modern cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) that provides fast, reliable, and secure access between users and applications' static and dynamic web content across the globe. It delivers content using Microsoft's global edge network with hundreds of global and local points of presence (PoPs) distributed around the world close to both enterprise and consumer end-users."
  - content: "A company wants to protect their Azure resources from DDoS attacks. Which Azure DDoS Protection tier should they choose if they want to pay per protected IP and receive additional value-added services such as rapid response support, cost protection, and discounts on WAF?"
    choices:
    - content: "DDoS Protection Key Features"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DDoS Protection Key Features provides always-on traffic monitoring, adaptive real-time tuning, and DDoS protection analytics, metrics, and alerting, but it does not offer additional value-added services such as rapid response support, cost protection, and discounts on WAF."
    - content: "DDoS Network Protection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DDoS Network Protection is automatically tuned to help protect specific Azure resources in a virtual network, but it does not offer additional value-added services such as rapid response support, cost protection, and discounts on WAF."
    - content: "DDoS IP Protection"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. DDoS IP Protection is a pay-per-protected-IP model that offers the same core engineering features as DDoS Network Protection, but with additional value-added services such as rapid response support, cost protection, and discounts on WAF."
