Planning and implementing TLS encryption in Azure applications is essential for ensuring data security during transit. Here's a six-point summarization for enhancing TLS in Azure App Service and API Management:

## 1. Network segmentation with VNet:

 -  Deploy Azure applications, including App Service and API Management, within a private Virtual Network (VNet). Assign private IPs to services, refraining from public IPs unless explicitly needed.<br>

## 2. Network Security Group (NSG) configuration:<br>

 -  Utilize Network Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. Leverage Azure Virtual Network Service Tags to define access controls on NSGs, ensuring specific and secured communication pathways.<br>

## 3. Leverage Azure private link:<br>

 -  Deploy Azure Private Link's private endpoints for Azure services, establishing a private connectivity mechanism, thus ensuring secure access and data confidentiality.<br>

## 4. Disabling public network access:<br>

 -  Ensure public network access is disabled for Azure resources, including Azure SQL Managed Instances, to bolster security. Limit access to services via Private Endpoints or within virtual networks.<br>

## 5. Centralized identity management with Microsoft Entra ID:<br>

 -  Implement Microsoft Entra ID authentication for data plane access, ensuring centralized identity management. Limit or avoid the use of local authentication methods, transitioning primarily to Microsoft Entra ID.<br>

## 6. Monitor with Microsoft Defender for Cloud:<br>

 -  Monitor configurations using Microsoft Defender for Cloud, utilizing built-in Azure Policy definitions to ensure adherence to best practices, like provisioning Microsoft Entra ID.<br>
