Many organizations have an aging or under-engineered data platform strategy. There's been a significant trend of moving existing systems to the cloud, building new applications quickly with the cloud, and offloading some on-premises costs. You need a plan for how to move data workloads to the cloud. And you need to understand how to set up your organization for success.
