## Multiple Choice
Which cloud service type is most suited to a life and shift migration from an on-premises datacenter to a cloud deployment?
(x) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) {{With an IaaS service type, you can approximate your on-premises environment, making a lift-and-shift transition to the cloud relatively straightforward.}}
( ) Platform as a Service (PaaS) {{The PaaS service type may not provide the configuration flexibility to perform a lift-and-shift migration to the cloud. PaaS is generally better suited for deploying complete environments, like a development environment, where you want to focus on operations instead of configuration and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure.}}
( ) Software as a Service (SaaS) {{The SaaS service type is geared towards providing software solutions. Much of the infrastructure configuration is predetermined, preventing the configuration and control necessary for a lift-and-shift migration.}}

## Multiple Choice
What type of cloud service type would a Finance and Expense tracking solution typically be in?
( ) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) {{IaaS provides access to hardware and infrastructure to create your own custom environment.}}
( ) Platform as a Service (PaaS) {{PaaS provides access to platforms that have the operating system, development tools, and middleware installed and maintained by the cloud provider. Itâ€™s a middle point between IaaS and SaaS.}}
(x) Software as a Service (SaaS) {{SaaS provides access to software solutions, such as finance and expense tracking, email, or ticketing systems.}}
