You can create an application dashboard using either an industry focused template or the Custom application template. If you create your application from one of the industry focused templates, your application will have a pre-defined dashboard to start. If you create your application from the Custom application template, your dashboard will display a blank layout that you can customize yourself.<br>

> [!NOTE]
> Users can create multiple dashboards in addition to the default application dashboard. These dashboards can be personal to the user only, or shared across all users of the application.

As an administrator, you can create up to 10 application dashboards that are visible to all application users. Only administrators can create, edit, and delete application-level dashboards.

All users can create their own personal dashboards. Users can switch between application dashboards and personal dashboards.

## Add tiles to a dashboard

Open your Dashboard page from the left pane of the IoT Central application. To begin customizing the default dashboard for your application, select **Edit** at the top-left of the Dashboard page. Selecting **Edit** opens the **Edit dashboard** panel, which can be used to add and remove tiles in order to customize the dashboard. Selecting either **New dashboard** or **Copy** will also place the dashboard in edit mode.

You have two initial options when preparing to add a tile to your dashboard, **Start with a visual** and **Start with a device**.

For example, to add a line chart tile to track telemetry values reported by one or more devices over time:

1.  Select **Start with a Visual**, Line chart, and then **Add tile**, or just drag the tile onto the canvas..
2.  To edit the tile, select its **pencil** button. Enter a **Title** and select a **Device Group**. In the **Devices** list, select the devices to show on the tile.
3.  After you select all the devices to show on the tile, select **Update**.
4.  After you finish adding and customizing tiles on the dashboard, select **Save**.

Each tile has a pre-selected graph, chart, etc. that will be displayed when the tile is created. However, users can choose to edit and change this visualization.

## Edit tiles

To edit a tile on the dashboard, first select **Edit** at the top left of the page, which will open edit mode for the dashboard and all its tiles. This provides you with the following options::

 -  The **square** button lets you resize the tile.
 -  The **pencil** button lets you edit the visualization. For example, for a line chart you can choose to show the legend and axes and choose the time range to plot.
 -  The **copy** button lets you create a duplicate of the tile.
