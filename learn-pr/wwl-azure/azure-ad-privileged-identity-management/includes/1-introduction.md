Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) allows you to manage, control, and monitor access to the most important resources in your organization. You can give just-in-time access and just-enough-access to users to allow them to do their tasks.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses Privileged Identity Management to protect administrator privileges and mitigate the risk of excessive or misused access rights; some common tasks are:

 -  Configuring the scope of users and roles based on zero trust.
 -  Setting up a PIM workflow to enforce approval for role usage, and monitor the access.
 -  Implement just-in-time access.

## Skills measured

Azure Active Directory is a part of [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer](/learn/certifications/exams/az-500).
