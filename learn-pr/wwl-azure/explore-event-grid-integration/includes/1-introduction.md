Recognizing events when they occur and delivering timely notifications to business owners is an important aspect of business integration.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team needs to configure the solution to support triggering downstream business processes in response to IoT Hub events. You decide to gain experience implementing IoT Hub event-based notifications in a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:<br>

 -  Create a Logic App that sends an email.
 -  Configure an IoT Hub Event Subscription that triggers the Logic App when a device is created.
 -  Create a new device to generate an IoT Hub device-created event.

By the end of this module, you will be able to implement IoT Hub event-based notifications using Logic Apps and built-in Event Grid support.
