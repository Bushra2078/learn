To implement SAP workloads on Azure in a supported manner, customers should follow SAP certified configurations, which consist of a combination of the following four elements:

- **SAP product**
- **Operating system**
- **RDBMS**
- **Azure offering**, including Azure VM SKU and (if HANA) SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances)

This information is summarized at [SAP certifications and configurations running on Microsoft Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-certifications).
