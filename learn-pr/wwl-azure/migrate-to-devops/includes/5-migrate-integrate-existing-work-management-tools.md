Both Azure DevOps and GitHub can be integrated with different kinds of work management tools.

As an example, in the Visual Studio Marketplace, Microsoft offers Trello integration tooling.

Migrating from other work management tools to Azure DevOps takes considerable planning.

Most work management tools are highly configurable by the end user. There might not be a tool available that will do the migration without further configuration.

## Jira

Jira is a commonly used work management tool.

In the Visual Studio Marketplace, Solidify offers a tool for Jira to Azure DevOps migration. It migrates in two phases. Jira issues are exported to files, and then the files are imported to Azure DevOps.

If you decide to write the migration code yourself, the following blog post provides a sample code that might help you get started: [Migrate your project from Jira to Azure DevOps](http://www.azurefieldnotes.com/2018/10/01/migrate-your-project-from-jira-to-azure-devops/).

## Other applications

Third-party organizations offer commercial tooling to assist with migrating other work management tools like:

 -  Aha.
 -  BugZilla.
 -  ClearQuest.
 -  And others to Azure DevOps.
