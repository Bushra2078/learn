  questions:
  - content: "You want to investigate for which subgroups the model has relatively more false predictions, which Responsible AI component should be added to the pipeline to create the Responsible AI dashboard?"
    choices:
    - content: "Explanations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Explanations provide insights into which features influence the model's predictions."
    - content: "Counterfactuals."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Counterfactuals allow you to explore how changing the input influences the model's predictions."
    - content: "Error analysis."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Error analysis provides an overview of the amount of false predictions for specific subgroups in your dataset."
  - content: "What should be the first component in a pipeline to create a Responsible AI Dashboard?"
    choices:
    - content: "`RAI Insights dashboard constructor`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The dashboard constructor should be the first component in the pipeline."
    - content: "`Gather RAI Insights dashboard`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The gather insights component comes at the end of the pipeline."
    - content: "`Gather RAI Insights score card`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The gather insights component comes at the end of the pipeline."
  - content: "You have trained a model, and you want to quantify the influence of each feature on a specific individual prediction. What kind of feature importance should you examine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Aggregate feature importance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Incorrect. The environment includes the necessary packages for the model to run."
    - content: "Local feature importance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The flavor specifies the machine learning framework of the model."
    - content: "Individual feature importance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Correct. The model's signature defines the schemas of the inputs and outputs."
