Remember these key considerations while you plan and implement network security configurations for an ASE:

## Implement Virtual Network Integration:

 -  Use the Virtual Network integration feature to deploy services into a private Azure Virtual Network (VNet).<br>
 -  Benefit from a stable IP for outbound communications to enable allow-listing based on IP addresses.
 -  Deploy App Service in the Isolated pricing tier directly into a subnet within your Azure Virtual Network.

## Optimize Network Security Groups (NSGs):

 -  Harness the power of network security groups to manage traffic, blocking and allowing both inbound and outbound flows as required.<br>
 -  Ensure that explicit allow rules are added to network security groups, considering the default implicit deny rule.

## Enhance Security with Azure Private Link:

 -  Adopt private endpoints for Azure Web Apps, ensuring clients in your private network can securely interact with apps over Private Link.<br>
 -  Utilize private endpoints to streamline incoming traffic to your Web App while managing outgoing flows via the VNet integration feature.

## Limit Public Network Exposure:

 -  Actively disable public network access using IP ACL filtering rules, private endpoints, or by modifying the publicNetworkAccess property.<br>

## Integrate DDoS Protection:

 -  Upgrade the virtual network linked to your App Service's Web Application Firewall with DDoS Protection Standard, enhancing security measures against potential DDoS attacks.<br>

## Implement and Fine-Tune the Web Application Firewall (WAF):

 -  Ensure that traffic is routed through a WAF-enabled Azure Application Gateway or Azure Front Door.<br>
 -  Utilize a combination of Access Restrictions, Service Endpoints, and Private Endpoints to lock down access, preventing any bypass of the WAF.
