While planning and implementing network security configurations for an Azure SQL Managed Instance, follow this baseline:

## 1. Virtual Network Integration:

 -  Incorporate the SQL Managed Instance into a customer's private Virtual Network (VNet) and rely on private IPs, avoiding public IPs unless necessary.<br>
 -  Reference: Use virtual network service endpoints and rules for servers in Azure SQL Database.

## 2. Leverage Network Security Group (NSG) Support:

 -  Employ Azure Virtual Network Service Tags to define access controls on NSGs or Azure Firewall tailored for Azure SQL resources.<br>
 -  For seamless connectivity with Azure SQL Database, especially when using service endpoints, make sure NSGs are open to Azure SQL Database IPs.
 -  Reference: Use virtual network service endpoints and rules for servers in Azure SQL Database.

## 3. Implement Azure Private Link:

 -  Set up private endpoints for Azure resources that are compatible with the Private Link feature, which establishes a dedicated access point for these resources.<br>
 -  Reference: Azure Private Link for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics.

## 4. Disable Direct Public Network Access:

 -  Public network access is supported and enabled by default, but for enhanced security, consider disabling this feature.<br>
 -  Reference: Azure SQL connectivity settings.

## 5. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Monitoring:

 -  Enable Microsoft Defender to continually monitor and safeguard your Azure SQL Managed Instances.<br>

## 6. Follow Azure Policy Recommendations:

 -  Disable public network access on Azure SQL Managed Instances to ensure access is only from within their virtual networks or via Private Endpoints.<br>
 -  Enable private endpoint connections to fortify secure communication with Azure SQL Database.
 -  Turn off the public network access property on Azure SQL Database to enforce access only from a private endpoint.
