  - content: "An organization has a web application and is concerned about attacks that flood the network layer with a substantial amount of seemingly legitimate traffic, how can this type of attack be blocked?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add a Web Application Firewall"

      explanation: "Web Application Firewall would not work for this need, it does not protect at the network layer."
