Think of security in layers.  You need to lock down the perimeter first, and then work your way inward locking down each layer.  The more work and cost a bad-actor has to invest to get to valuable information the more likely they are to leave you alone.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses perimeter security features to block network traffic away from your primary network resources; you will work on such tasks as:
- Setup DDoS (denial-of-service) Protection.
- Configure and maintain firewalls.
- Use dedicated routes and network appliance to protect your network.
