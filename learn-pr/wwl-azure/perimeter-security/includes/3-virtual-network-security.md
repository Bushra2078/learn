## Azure Networking Components

The following sections define key terminology for Azure networking. Later, this course will cover each of these areas in more detail.

Azure Virtual Networks are a key component of Azure security services. The Azure network infrastructure enables you to securely connect Azure resources to each other with virtual networks (VNets). A VNet is a representation of your own network in the cloud. A VNet is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud network dedicated to your subscription. You can connect VNets to your on-premises networks.

Azure supports **dedicated WAN link connectivity** to your on-premises network and an Azure Virtual Network with ExpressRoute. The link between Azure and your site uses a dedicated connection that does not go over the public Internet. If your Azure application is running in multiple datacenters, you can use Azure Traffic Manager to route requests from users intelligently across instances of the application. You can also route traffic to services not running in Azure if they are accessible from the Internet.

## Virtual networks

Organizations can use virtual networks to connect resources. Virtual networks in Azure are network overlays that you can use to configure and control the connectivity among Azure resources, such as VMs and load balancers.

Azure Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. A virtual network is scoped to a single Azure region. An Azure region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

Virtual networks are made up of subnets. A subnet is a range of IP addresses within your virtual network. Subnets, like virtual networks, are scoped to a single Azure region. You can implement multiple virtual networks within each Azure subscription and Azure region. Each virtual network is isolated from other virtual networks. For each virtual network you can:

* Specify a custom private IP address space using public and private addresses. Azure assigns resources in a virtual network a private IP address from the address space that you assign.
* Segment the virtual network into one or more subnets and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet.
* Use Azure-provided name resolution, or specify your own DNS server, for use by resources in a virtual network.

## IP addresses

VMs, Azure load balancers, and application gateways in a single virtual network require unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses the same way that clients in an on-premises subnet do. This enables these resources to communicate with each other. A virtual network uses two types of IP addresses:

* **Private** - A private IP address is dynamically or statically allocated to a VM from the defined scope of IP addresses in the virtual network. VMs use these addresses to communicate with other VMs in the same or connected virtual networks through a gateway / Azure ExpressRoute connection. These private IP addresses, or non-routable IP addresses, conform to RFC 1918.

* **Public** - Public IP addresses, which allow Azure resources to communicate with external clients, are assigned directly at the virtual network adapter of the VM or to the load balancer. Public IP address can also be added to Azure-only virtual networks. All IP blocks in the virtual network will be routable only within the customer's network, and they won't be reachable from outside. Virtual network packets travel through the high-speed Azure backplane.

You can control the dynamic IP addresses assigned to VMs and cloud services within an Azure virtual network by specifying an IP addressing scheme. Planning an IP addressing scheme within an Azure virtual network is much like planning an IP addressing scheme on-premises. The same ranges are often used, and the same rules applied. However, conditions exist that are unique to Azure virtual networks.

## Subnets

You can further divide your network by using subnets for the logical and security-related isolation of Azure resources. Each subnet contains a range of IP addresses that fall within the virtual network address space. Subnetting hides the details of internal network organization from external routers. Subnetting also segments the host within the network, making it easier to apply network security at the interconnections between subnets.

## Network adapters

VMs communicate with other VMs and other resources on the network by using virtual network adapters. Virtual network adapters configure VMs with private and, optionally, public IP address. A VM can have more than one network adapter for different network configurations.
