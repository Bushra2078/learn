**User Defined Routes**

A User Defined Routes (UDR) is a custom route in Azure that overrides Azure's default system routes or adds routes to a subnet's route table. In Azure, you create a route table and then associate that route table with zero or more virtual network subnets. Each subnet can have zero or one route table associated with it. If you create a route table and associate it to a subnet, Azure either combines its routes with the default routes that Azure adds to a subnet or overrides those default routes.

In this diagram UDRs are used to direct traffic from the Gateway subnet and the Web tier to the Network Virtual Appliance (NVA).

## Network Virtual Appliances

You can deploy an NVA to a perimeter network in many architectures. In the previous diagram, the NVA helps provide a secure network boundary by checking all inbound and outbound network traffic and then passing only the traffic that meets the network security rules. However, the fact that all network traffic passes through the NVA means that the NVA is a single point of failure in the network. If the NVA fails, no other path will exist for network traffic, and all the back-end subnets will become unavailable.

To make an NVA highly available, deploy more than one NVA into an availability set.

The following figure shows a high-availability architecture that implements an ingress perimeter network behind an internet-facing load balancer. This architecture is designed to provide connectivity to Azure workloads for layer 7 traffic, such as HTTP or HTTPS traffic.

The benefit of this architecture is that all NVAs are active, and if one fails, the load balancer directs network traffic to the other NVA. Both NVAs route traffic to the internal load balancer, so if one NVA is active, traffic will continue to flow. The NVAs are required to terminate SSL traffic intended for the web tier VMs. These NVAs canâ€™t be extended to handle on-premises traffic, because on-premises traffic requires another dedicated set of NVAs with their own network.

UDRs and NSGs help provide layer 3 and layer 4 (of the OSI model) security. NVAs help provide layer 7, application layer, security.
