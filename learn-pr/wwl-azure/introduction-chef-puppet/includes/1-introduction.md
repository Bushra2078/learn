Configuration management tools enable changes and deployments to be faster, repeatable, scalable, predictable, and able to maintain the desired state, bringing controlled assets into an expected state.

Some advantages of using configuration management tools include:

 -  Adherence to coding conventions that make it easier to navigate code.
 -  Idempotency, which means that the end state remains the same, no matter how many times the code is executed.
 -  Distribution design to improve managing large numbers of remote servers.

Some configuration management tools use a pull model.

An agent installed on the servers runs periodically to pull the latest definitions from a central repository and apply them to the server.

Other tools use a push model, where a central server triggers updates to managed servers.

Configuration management tools enable the use of tested and proven software development practices to manage and provision data centers in real-time through plaintext definition files.
