  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of Encryption at Rest in Microsoft Cloud Services?"
    choices:
    - content: "To encrypt data only for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) customers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Encryption at Rest is available for all three cloud models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS."
    - content: "To encrypt data in transit between cloud services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Encryption at Rest is not related to data in transit."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Encryption at Rest helps ensure that data is never persisted in unencrypted form, providing a more complete solution for securing data in the cloud."
  - content: "What is the purpose of integrating Microsoft Entra ID with AKS clusters?"
    choices:
    - content: "To provide granular access control to Azure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a general statement about access control in Azure, but not specific to Microsoft Entra ID integration with AKS clusters."
    - content: "To provide identity management for Kubernetes clusters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a general statement about identity management in Kubernetes, but not specific to Microsoft Entra ID integration."
    - content: "To centralize identity management and automatically update user account or group status in access to the AKS cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Integrating Microsoft Entra ID with AKS clusters centralizes identity management and automatically updates user account or group status in access to the AKS cluster, making it easier to manage access to resources and services."
  - content: "What is the purpose of Azure role based access control (Azure RBAC) in Azure Container Registry?"
    choices:
    - content: "To restrict access to Azure Container Registry only for users, not service principals."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Service principals can also be assigned specific permissions using Azure RBAC."
    - content: "To provide access to all Azure resources for a user or service principal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would be too broad and not recommended as a best practice."
    - content: "To assign specific permissions to users, service principals, or other identities that need to interact with a registry."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure RBAC allows for fine-grained control over permissions for interacting with an Azure Container Registry."
  - content: "A company is using Azure Container Instances to host their containerized applications. They want to optimize the resource settings for their container groups. Which Azure service can provide insight into the compute resources used by their container instances and help determine the best resource settings?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Functions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables developers to run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure."
    - content: "Azure Logic Apps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based service that provides a way to create workflows that integrate with various systems and services."
    - content: "Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Monitor provides insight into the compute resources used by container instances and helps determine the best resource settings for container groups."
  - content: "A team is managing a multitenant cluster in AKS and wants to isolate resources. What Kubernetes feature creates a logical isolation boundary for workloads and resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Pod disruption budgets"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pod disruption budgets are used for ensuring high availability during node maintenance."
    - content: "Resource quotas"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Resource quotas are used for scheduling and limiting resource usage."
    - content: "Kubernetes Namespace"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Kubernetes Namespace creates a logical isolation boundary for workloads and resources, allowing teams and workloads to be isolated in the same cluster."
