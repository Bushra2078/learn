  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of Encryption at Rest in Microsoft Cloud Services?"
    choices:
    - content: "To encrypt data only for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) customers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Encryption at Rest is available for all three cloud models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS."
    - content: "To encrypt data in transit between cloud services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Encryption at Rest is not related to data in transit."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Encryption at Rest helps ensure that data is never persisted in unencrypted form, providing a more complete solution for securing data in the cloud."
  - content: "What is the purpose of integrating Microsoft Entra ID with AKS clusters?"
    choices:
    - content: "To provide granular access control to Azure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a general statement about access control in Azure, but not specific to Microsoft Entra ID integration with AKS clusters."
    - content: "To provide identity management for Kubernetes clusters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a general statement about identity management in Kubernetes, but not specific to Microsoft Entra ID integration."
    - content: "To centralize identity management and automatically update user account or group status in access to the AKS cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Integrating Microsoft Entra ID with AKS clusters centralizes identity management and automatically updates user account or group status in access to the AKS cluster, making it easier to manage access to resources and services."
  - content: "What is the purpose of Azure role based access control (Azure RBAC) in Azure Container Registry?"
    choices:
    - content: "To restrict access to Azure Container Registry only for users, not service principals."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Service principals can also be assigned specific permissions using Azure RBAC."
    - content: "To provide access to all Azure resources for a user or service principal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would be too broad and not recommended as a best practice."
    - content: "To assign specific permissions to users, service principals, or other identities that need to interact with a registry."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure RBAC allows for fine-grained control over permissions for interacting with an Azure Container Registry."
  - content: "What is the purpose of Azure DevTest Labs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the definition of Azure Resource Manager."
    - content: "A cloud-based service that provides a central location for managing keys, secrets, and certificates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the definition of Azure Key Vault."
    - content: "Provides developers and testers a self-service sandbox environment to quickly create and deploy environments for testing and experimentation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure DevTest Labs is a service that provides developers and testers a self-service sandbox environment to quickly create and deploy environments for testing and experimentation."
  - content: "What is the advantage of using managed mode over standard Identity assignment on the virtual machine scale set of a node pool in AKS?"
    choices:
    - content: "Managed mode requires write permissions on the virtual machine scale set used by the AKS cluster and Managed Identity Operator permission on the user assigned managed identities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a requirement for standard mode, not an advantage of managed mode."
    - content: "Managed mode takes longer to assign the identity to the virtual machine scale set of the node pool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The opposite is true. Managed mode has the identity pre-assigned, while standard mode can take up to 40-60 seconds to assign the identity."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Managed mode allows for pre-assigned identities, which enables automation and validation of environment creation and teardown, leading to more secure and stable application hosting platforms."
