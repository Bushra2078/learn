One year later, on December 16, 2013, the DoD, through a Memorandum titled "Supplemental Guidance for the Department of Defense's Acquisition and Secure Use of Commercial Cloud Services" (December 16, 2013) provided ancillary guidance on acquisition of cloud services.

The text of the memorandum is no longer publicly available.

### Security controls further detailed

The memorandum adds additional security controls and processes by which commercial cloud service providers would need to abide by in order to handle higher level workloads.

In Congressional testimony with the Committee on Armed Services, Subcommittee on Intelligence, it was revealed that the memorandum was a push to further clarify the standards for commercial cloud providers. 

It was also stated that DISA already adheres to many of the outlined standards as defined in the DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs).

### Impact

While clarifying its initial strategy to leverage DISA as the Enterprise Cloud Broker, the memorandum made clear it would need to assemble more comprehensive and formal guidance on the acquisition of secure commercial cloud services once commercial cloud service providers were able to meet the requirements it set forth.

The memorandum also signals the DoD's intent to start allowing commercial cloud service providers to handle higher classification and more sensitive workloads as an alternative to DISA's data centers.
