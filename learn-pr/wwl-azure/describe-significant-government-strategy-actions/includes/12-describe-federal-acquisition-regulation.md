        The way in which the U.S. Government procures, or buys, services is through FAR, or Federal Acquisition Regulation. Federal Acquisition Regulations are in place to ensure that when the Government purchases goods or services, that the providers of those services abide by specific guidelines, and that no illegal activities are occurring.

        Acquisition is a government-wide function. All agencies and organizations procure goods and services to support mission and organization requirements. As such, the General Services Administration has a Federal Acquisition Policy Division.

As noted on [its web site](https://www.acquisition.gov/):

> The Federal Acquisition Policy Division, working with the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), writes the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The FAR is the rule book for all federal agency procurements that governs the billions of contract dollars expended by the federal government every year.
> 
> The division coordinates with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and other agencies to implement laws, executive orders, other agency regulations, and governmentwide policies to maintain the FAR.

### FAR and cloud computing

After a decade of developing its cloud strategy, the US Government realized that it must make key changes to the way it acquires cloud services as the existing mechanisms in FAR were not addressing key needs.

In 2015, it made [the following changes to FAR section 12.301](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.239-7010-cloud-computing-services.#DFARS-252.239-7010), which addresses the acquisition of commercial items.

#### Cloud services and the contracting officer

It stated that all cloud services must be approved by a Contracting Officer (COR). A Contracting Officer is the one responsible for overseeing the execution of a government contract.

#### Security requirements guide responsibility

It stated that contractors are responsible for implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in alignment with the security requirements guide (SRG).

#### Data residency

It stated that all Government data must reside within the United States or other outlying US areas unless the COR authorizes it. This is important because Microsoft and other cloud service providers have data centers all over the world. Therefore, mechanisms needed to be put into place to ensure data resides only within the continental United States, or CONUS, unless otherwise allowed.

#### Data privacy

It stated that the cloud service provider contractor shall not access, use, or disclose Government data unless specifically authorized by the terms of this contract or a task order or delivery order. This is important to note as it established strong privacy protections for Government data.

It further states that the cloud service provider contractor shall use Government-related data only to manage the operational environment that supports the Government data and for no other purpose unless otherwise permitted with the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.

#### Data retention

It also puts into place requirements on how to handle records retention, how to handle spillage in conjunction with a COR.

## Importance

It should be noted that making changes to Federal Acquisition Regulation is a very lengthy, very detailed process that is often talked about, but rarely actually undertaken because of its complexity.

There is only so much that the Executive Branch can do, however, as it relates to acquisition. Major changes to acquisition must be undertaken by Congress.
