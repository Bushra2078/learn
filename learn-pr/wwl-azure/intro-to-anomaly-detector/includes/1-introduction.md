Anomaly detection is an artificial intelligence technique used to determine whether values in a series are within expected parameters. 

There are many scenarios where anomaly detection is helpful. For example, a smart HVAC system might use anomaly detection to monitor temperatures in a building and raise an alert if the temperature goes above or below the expected value for a given period of time.

Other scenarios include: 
- monitoring blood pressure
- evaluating mean time between failures for hardware products
- comparing month-over-month expenses for product costs

Azure AI Anomaly Detector is a cloud-based service that helps you monitor and detect abnormalities in your historical time series and real-time data.
