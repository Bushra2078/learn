In this module, you've learned IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS each contain different levels of managed services. You may easily use a combination of these types of infrastructure. You could use Microsoft 365 on your company's computers (SaaS), and in Azure, you could host your VMs (IaaS), and use Azure SQL Database (PaaS) to store your data. With the cloud's flexibility, you can use any combination that provides you with the maximum result. 

Now that you have completed this module, you are able to:

- Describe Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- Describe Platform as a Service (PaaS).
- Describe Software as a Service (SaaS).
