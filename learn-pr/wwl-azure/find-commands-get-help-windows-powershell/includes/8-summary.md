In this module, you've learned the strategies and tools to find Windows PowerShell cmdlets based on the actions they perform and the features or technologies they manage. The following are the key takeaways:

 -  Modules are groups of related PowerShell capabilities that are bundled together into a single unit. Modules help with organizing cmdlets into distributable units.
 -  Finding the cmdlet that you need from the extensive built-in help of Windows PowerShell can be a challenge. Using the –Module parameter and **Get Help** can make this task easier.
 -  Batch commands used in the traditional Windows Command Prompt shell (**cmd.exe**) can also be used within Windows PowerShell. This is because they're aliases of the cmdlets that perform the equivalent action.
 -  The **Show-Command** cmdlet opens a window that displays either a list of commands or a specific command's parameters. To display a specific command's parameters, provide the name of the command as the value for the *‑Name* parameter.
 -  The **Get-Help** command can help you access the extensive in-product help for commands that Windows PowerShell provides.
 -  Learning to interpret the help-file syntax can help you to identify all capabilities of a given command.
 -  Windows PowerShell 3.0 and newer versions don't ship with help files. Instead, help files are available as an online service. Run **Update-Help** to scan your computer for all installed modules, retrieve online help locations for each, and try to download their respectvive help files.
