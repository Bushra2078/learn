SAP and Microsoft have a long history of working together in a strong partnership that has mutual benefits for their customers. Microsoft is constantly updating its platform and submitting new certification details to SAP in order to ensure Microsoft Azure is the best platform on which to run your SAP workloads.

The uniqueness of Azure for SAP HANA is an offer that sets Azure apart. To enable hosting more memory and CPU resource-demanding SAP scenarios that involve SAP HANA, Azure offers the use of customer-dedicated bare-metal hardware. Use this solution to run SAP HANA deployments that require up to 24 TB (120 TB scale-out) of memory for S/4HANA or other SAP HANA workload.

Hosting SAP workload scenarios in Azure also can create requirements of identity integration and single sign-on. This situation can occur when you use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to connect different SAP components and SAP software-as-a-service (SaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offers.

Some benefits of running SAP applications on Azure are:

 -  **On-demand and scalable**: Azure provides compute resources on-demand with a pay per use model. Enterprises can scale the resources up and down based on their usage needs. Additionally, Azure also offers purpose-built HANA large instances that can support large memory implementations.
 -  **Intelligent solutions**: By taking advantage of Azure data services, analytics service, and tools like Power BI, users gain insights from their data.
 -  **Security and compliance**: Azure makes it easy to protect your data and solutions using encryption, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and Azure Active Directory, which provides single sign on across multiple services, both on-premises and cloud. With various industry compliance and trust certifications, Azure provides a complete compliance solution.
 -  **Global scale**: Azure has the largest footprint of any cloud providers with 54 regions to support any scale, enabling organizations to optimize for the best user experience and to meet local data residency requirements.
 -  **Enterprise-grade resilience**: Azure provides enterprise grade resilience with redundancy and geo replication with 99.99% SLA.
 -  **Lower TCO**: Azure also provides for a 60% cost reduction when compared to traditional, on-premise storage systems. By using SAP technologies on Azure, customers can realize 40-75% TCO cost savings in Dev and Test environments.
