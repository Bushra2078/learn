You can also run Terraform configuration files using Visual Studio Code. It uses other Terraform services that you can integrate with Visual Studio Code.

Two Visual Studio code extensions that are required are **Azure Account**, and **Terraform**.

In this walkthrough, you'll create a VM in Visual Studio Code using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

 -  This walkthrough requires Visual Studio Code. If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed, you can download it from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Download and install a version of Visual Studio Code appropriate to your operating system environment, for example, Windows, Linux, or macOS.
 -  You'll require an active Azure subscription to do the steps in this walkthrough. If you don't have one, create an Azure subscription by following the steps outlined on the [Create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) webpage.

## Steps

1.  Launch the Visual Studio Code editor.
2.  The two Visual Studio Code extensions *Azure Account* and *Azure Terraform,* must be installed. To install the first extension, from inside Visual Studio Code, select **File** &gt; **Preferences** &gt; **Extensions**.
3.  Search for and install the extension **Azure Account**.

4.  Search for and install the extension **Terraform**. Ensure that you select the extension authored by Microsoft, as other authors have similar extensions.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/visual-studio-code-terraform-1-d066de8a.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio with the Terraform extension highlighted.":::


    You can view more details of this extension at the Visual Studio Marketplace on the Azure Terraform page.

5.  In Visual Studio Code, open the command palette by selecting **View** &gt; **Command Palette**. You can also access the command palette by selecting the **settings** (cog) icon on the bottom, left side of the **Visual Studio Code** window, and then choosing **Command Palette**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/visual-studio-code-command-palette-signin-672226bd.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code with view menu and command palette highlighted.":::


6.  In the Command Palette search field, type **Azure:** Select Azure: Sign In from the results.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/visual-studio-code-command-palette-d816addb.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code command palette with the Azure. Command entered and Azure. Sign in command highlighted.":::


7.  When a browser launches and prompts you to sign in to Azure, select your Azure account. The message *You're signed in now and can close this page*, should display in the browser.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/visual-studio-code-message-4ba32ff9.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a browser with the message, you are signed in now and can close this page.":::


8.  Verify that your Azure account now displays at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window.
9.  Create a new file, then copy the following code and paste it into the file.

    ```

10. Save the file locally with the file name `terraform-createvm.tf`.
11. In Visual Studio Code, select **View** &gt; **Command Palette**. Search for the command by entering **terraform** into the search field. Select the following command from the dropdown list of commands:
    
    ```Yml
    Azure Terraform: apply
    
    ```
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/visual-studio-code-terraform-2-ae423034.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code with the command palette open and the command Azure Terraform apply selected.":::
    

12. If Azure Cloud Shell isn't open in Visual Studio Code, a message might appear in the bottom-left corner asking you if you want to open Azure Cloud Shell. Choose **Accept** and select **Yes**.
13. Wait for the Azure Cloud Shell pane to appear at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window and start running the file `terraform-createvm.tf`. When you're prompted to apply the plan or cancel, type **Yes**, and then press **Enter**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/visual-studio-code-terraform-3-bda00c96.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code Azure Cloud Shell pane running the terraform-createvm.tf config file. At the bottom, a prompt displays asking if you want to continue with the resultant plan, and the value Yes.":::
    

14. After the command completes successfully, review the list of resources created.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/visual-studio-code-terraform-4-04463584.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the deployed resources in Azure Cloud Shell pane, with the terraform apply command completed.":::
    

15. Open the Azure portal and verify the resource group, resources, and the VM has been created. If you have time, sign in with the username and password specified in the .tf config file to verify.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you wanted to use a public or private key pair to connect to the Linux VM instead of a username and password, you could use the **os\_profile\_linux\_config** module, set the **disable\_password\_authentication** key value to **true** and include the ssh key details, as in the following code.

    ```yml
    os_profile_linux_config {
        disable_password_authentication = true
        ssh_keys {
            path    = "/home/azureuser/.ssh/authorized_keys"
            key_data = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz{snip}hwhqT9h"
        }
    }

    ```

    You'd also need to remove the password value in the **os\_profile module** that present in the example above.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You could also embed the Azure authentication within the script. In that case, you would not need to install the Azure account extension, as in the following example:

    ```yml
    provider "azurerm" {
        subscription_id = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        client_id      = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        client_secret  = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        tenant_id      = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        features {}
    }

    ```
