    choices:
    - content: "Nothing. Pg_stat_statements are already enabled."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Pg_stat_statements are already enabled."
    - content: "Turn on the **pg_stat_statements.track** setting."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **pg_stat_statements.track** setting is turned on by default."
    - content: "In **Server parameters**, enable **pg_qs.query_capture_mode**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. **pg_qs.query_capture_mode** enables the Query Store."
  - content: "In the Query Store, how do you view the SQL syntax of queries?"
    choices:
    - content: "Query the **query_store.runtime_stats_view** view."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **query_store.runtime_stats_view** view returns runtime statistics information."
    - content: "Query the **query_store.qs_view** view."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The **query_store.qs_view** view includes blocks, runtime, and query text."
    - content: "Query the **query_store.pgms_wait_sampling_view** view."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **query_store.pgms_wait_sampling_view** view returns wait times for queries."
  - content: "How do you view the text of a query in Query Performance Insight?"
    choices:
    - content: "Find the QUERY ID value for the query that you want to investigate. Query the query_store.query_texts_view using this QUERY ID."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Query Performance Insight doesn't display query text, but you can find the QUERY ID of each query and search query_store.query_texts_view to find the query text."
    - content: "In Query Performance Insight, right-click the query and select **More information**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Due to privacy concerns, Query Performance Insight doesn't display query text on this page."
    - content: "In Query Performance Insight, select the **Query Store View** tab."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Query Performance Insight doesn't have a tab to display query text."
