The IoT device lifecycle covers everything from the manufacturer's configuration through device retirement.

Suppose you have joined a team that will be implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Device configuration and management are critical for an IoT solution and will require a detailed understanding of the device lifecycle before the implementation process begins. To prepare, you decide to examine device lifecycle documentation that covers everything from device registration through retirement.

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine the IoT device lifecycle terms and device type classifications.
 -  Examine the concept of device twins and how devices twins can be used to monitor devices.
 -  Examine the conditions under which devices may need to be retired.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the IoT device lifecycle, how device twins can be used to monitor devices.
