The devices that you implement within an Azure IoT solution can range from constrained sensors and single purpose microcontrollers, to powerful gateways that route communications for groups of devices.

## Azure IoT device types

The physical devices that connect to IoT Hub are defined as either IoT Devices or IoT Edge Devices.

 -  IoT Devices: An IoT device is typically a small-scale, standalone computing device that may collect data or control other devices. For example, a device might be an environmental monitoring device, or a controller for the watering and ventilation systems in a greenhouse.
 -  IoT Edge Devices: IoT Edge devices have the IoT Edge runtime installed and are flagged as IoT Edge device in the device details. An IoT Edge device can be used as a field gateway device, meaning that it is an IoT Edge device that connects downstream devices to the Azure IoT Hub (downstream devices can be either IoT devices or IoT Edge devices). IoT Edge will be discussed in detail later in the course.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft maintains an online device catalog that provides a list of hardware devices certified to work with IoT Hub: [Azure Certified for IoT Device Catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/alldevices).

Simulated devices can be used in various stages during the rollout of an IoT solution to represent individual device behaviors or to generate a telemetry workload. A simulated device is a software representation of a physical device that runs on your local machine or in the cloud.<br>
