Microsoft Teams combines many elements of Microsoft 365&mdash;such as Microsoft 365 groups, Exchange Online, and SharePoint storage&mdash;into a single location for collaboration. You can install the Microsoft Teams module to manage Microsoft Teams by using Windows PowerShell.

You can create and configure Microsoft Teams by using cmdlets with a noun that starts with **Team**, such as the following cmdlets:

- **Get-Team**
- **Add-TeamUser**
- **New-TeamsApp**

The Microsoft Teams module also includes many functions. These functions have the same verb-noun naming format as other cmdlets, but with a noun that starts with **CsTeam**. For example, the following cmdlets are included in the Microsoft Teams module:

- **Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy**
- **Remove-CsTeamTemplate**
- **New-CsTeamsEmergencyCallingPolicy**
- **Get-CsTeamsMessagingPolicy**

The functions in the Microsoft Teams module are for configuring of the overall service, but not individual Teams. Also included are commands that you can use to create and configure user policies, and to control and manage communications.
