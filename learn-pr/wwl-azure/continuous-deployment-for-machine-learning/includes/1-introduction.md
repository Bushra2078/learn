**Machine learning operations** (**MLOps**) aims to more efficiently and easily scale from an experimental project to a machine learning workload in production. 

To train a model, you'll want to experiment with many different configurations in an easy-to-use environment. On the other hand, to deploy a model to production, you want a set-up that is ready to scale and future-proof. 

As machine learning often requires both an experimentation or *development environment* and a *production environment*, you'll want to use **continuous delivery** to automate the process of moving a model from development to production.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll learn:

- How to set up environments for development and production.
- How to control deployments with approval gates.
