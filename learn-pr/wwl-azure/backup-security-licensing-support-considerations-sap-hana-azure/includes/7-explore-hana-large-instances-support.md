Deployment of SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) requires a Microsoft Premier support contract. For specific information related to running SAP in Azure, see [SAP Note \#2015553](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2015553). If you use HANA Large Instance units with 384 and more CPUs, you also need to extend the Premier support contract to include Azure Rapid Response.

SAP requires you to have a support contract with your Linux provider as well. This requirement isn't removed by the solution of HANA Large Instance or the fact that you run Linux in Azure. Unlike with some of the Linux Azure gallery images, the service fee is not included in the solution offer of HANA Large Instance. It's your responsibility to fulfill the requirements of SAP regarding support contracts with the Linux distributor.

 -  **For SUSE Linux**, refer to the requirements of support contracts in [SAP Note \#1984787](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1984787) and [SAP Note \#1056161](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1056161).
 -  **For Red Hat Linux**, you need to have the correct subscription levels that include support and service updates to the operating systems of HANA Large Instance. Red Hat recommends the Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription for SAP solution. Refer to [Overview of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions subscription](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3082481).

For the support matrix of the different SAP HANA versions with the different Linux versions, see [SAP Note \#2235581](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2235581). The expectation is that you're an SAP customer and have a support contract with SAP. Especially for implementations of the Type II class of HANA Large Instance SKUs, consult with SAP on versions of SAP HANA and the eventual configurations on large-sized scale-up hardware.
