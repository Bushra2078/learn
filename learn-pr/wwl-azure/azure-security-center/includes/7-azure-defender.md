## Microsoft Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features

The enhanced security features are free for the first 30 days. At the end of 30 days, if you decide to continue using the service, we'll automatically start charging for usage.

You can upgrade from the **Environment settings** page, as described in **Quickstart: Enable enhanced security features**. For pricing details in your local currency or region, see the **pricing page**.

What are the benefits of enabling enhanced security features?

Defender for Cloud is offered in **two modes**:

1. **Without enhanced security features** (Free) - Defender for Cloud is enabled for free on all your Azure subscriptions when you visit the workload protection dashboard in the Azure portal for the first time, or if enabled programmatically via API. Using this free mode provides the secure score and its related features: security policy, continuous security assessment, and actionable security recommendations to help you protect your Azure resources.
1. **Defender for Cloud with all enhanced security features** \- Enabling enhanced security extends the capabilities of the free mode to workloads running in private and other public clouds, providing unified security management and threat protection across your hybrid cloud workloads.
    
    Some of the major benefits include:
    
    
     -  **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** \- Microsoft Defender for Servers includes Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR).
     -  **Vulnerability assessment for virtual machines, container registries, and SQL resources** \- Easily enable vulnerability assessment solutions to discover, manage, and resolve vulnerabilities. View, investigate, and remediate the findings directly from within Defender for Cloud.
     -  **Multi-cloud security** \- Connect your accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to protect resources and workloads on those platforms with a range of Microsoft Defender for Cloud security features.
     -  **Hybrid security** â€“ Get a unified view of security across all of your on-premises and cloud workloads. Apply security policies and continuously assess the security of your hybrid cloud workloads to ensure compliance with security standards. Collect, search, and analyze security data from multiple sources, including firewalls and other partner solutions.
     -  **Threat protection alerts** \- Advanced behavioral analytics and the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph provide an edge over evolving cyber-attacks. Built-in behavioral analytics and machine learning can identify attacks and zero-day exploits. Monitor networks, machines, data stores (SQL servers hosted inside and outside Azure, Azure SQL databases, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Storage), and cloud services for incoming attacks and post-breach activity. Streamline investigation with interactive tools and contextual threat intelligence.
     -  **Track compliance with a range of standards** \- Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your hybrid cloud environment to analyze the risk factors according to the controls and best practices in Azure Security Benchmark. When you enable the enhanced security features, you can apply a range of other industry standards, regulatory standards, and benchmarks according to your organization's needs. Add standards and track your compliance with them from the regulatory compliance dashboard.
     -  **Access and application controls** \- Block malware and other unwanted applications by applying machine learning-powered recommendations adapted to your specific workloads to create allow and blocklists. Reduce the network attack surface with just-in-time, controlled access to management ports on Azure VMs. Access and application controls drastically reduce exposure to brute force and other network attacks.
     -  **Container security features** \- Benefit from vulnerability management and real-time threat protection on your containerized environments. Charges are based on the number of unique container images pushed to your connected registry. After an image has been scanned once, you won't be charged for it again unless it's modified and pushed once more.
     -  **Breadth threat protection for resources connected to Azure** \- Cloud-native threat protection for the Azure services common to all of your resources: Azure Resource Manager, Azure DNS, Azure network layer, and Azure Key Vault. Defender for Cloud has unique visibility into the Azure management layer and the Azure DNS layer, and can therefore protect cloud resources that are connected to those layers.
