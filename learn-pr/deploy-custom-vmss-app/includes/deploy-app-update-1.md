Throughout the lifecycle of a scale set, you may need to deploy an updated version of your application. With the Custom Script Extension, you can reference an updated deploy script and then reapply the extension to your scale set. When the scale set was created in a previous quickstart module, the `--upgrade-policy-mode` was set to *automatic*. This setting allows the VM instances in the scale set to automatically update and apply the latest version of your application.
