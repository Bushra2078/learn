To run applications on virtual machine (VM) instances in a scale set, you first needed to install the application components and required files. In a previous quickstart module, you learned how to create and use a custom VM image with Packer to deploy your VM instances. This custom image included the install of the NGINX web server components. You can also automate the install of applications to a scale set after each VM instance is deployed, or update an application that already runs on a scale set. In this quickstart module, you learn how to use the Azure Custom Script Extension to install applications to VM instances in a scale set.

## What is the Azure Custom Script Extension?
The Custom Script Extension downloads and executes scripts on Azure VMs. This extension is useful for post deployment configuration, software installation, or any other configuration / management task. Scripts can be downloaded from Azure storage or GitHub, or provided to the Azure portal at extension run-time.

The Custom Script extension integrates with Azure Resource Manager templates, and can also be used with the Azure CLI 2.0, Azure PowerShell, Azure portal, or the REST API.

To use the Custom Script Extension with the Azure CLI, you create a JSON file that defines what files to obtain and commands to execute. These JSON definitions can be reused across scale set deployments to apply consistent application installs.
