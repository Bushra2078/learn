Some of the insights from Video Indexer may be less helpful for travelers to browse and filter videos. For instance, for a video at the beach the insights may include labels for “ground” and “dune”. It can lead to the video showing in searches where it is not a strong match.

You can edit some insights using the portal. The insights available for edit will vary depending on what was extracted for your video.
