In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **ml-model** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **3. Regression Modeling** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Motivate the use of linear regression
- Train a simple regression model
- Interpret regression models
- Train a multivariate regression model

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
