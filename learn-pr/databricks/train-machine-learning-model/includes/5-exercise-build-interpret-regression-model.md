In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **ml-model** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **4. Exercise Regression Modeling** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

In this exercise, you will train a regression model using the Boston housing dataset to predict price of a home and interpret the statistical significance of the trained model coefficients.

> [!Note]
> You will find a corresponding notebook within the `Solutions` subfolder. This contains completed cells for the exercise. Refer to the notebook if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
