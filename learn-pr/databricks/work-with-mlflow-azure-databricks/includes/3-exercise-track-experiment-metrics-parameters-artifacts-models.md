In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **mlflow** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2. Exercise MLflow** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

In this exercise, you will use the diabetes dataset in scikit-learn and predict the progression metric (a quantitative measure of disease progression after one year after) based on BMI, and blood pressure. You will use the scikit-learn ElasticNet linear regression model, where you vary the alpha and l1_ratio parameters for tuning. You will use MLflow to log metrics, parameters, artifacts, and model.

> [!Note]
> You will find a corresponding notebook within the `Solutions` subfolder. This contains completed cells for the exercise. Refer to the notebook if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
