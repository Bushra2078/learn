  questions:
  - content: "How many drivers does a Cluster have?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only one"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A Cluster has one and only one driver."
    - content: "Two, running in parallel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A Cluster cannot have drivers running in parallel."
    - content: "Configurable between one and eight"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A driver manages work sent to one or more executors. A Cluster cannot have multiple drivers running in parallel."
  - content: "Spark is a distributed computing environment. Therefore, work is parallelized across executors. At which two levels does this parallelization occur?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Executor and the Slot"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The first level of parallelization is the Executor - a Java virtual machine running on a node, typically, one instance per node. Each Executor has a number of Slots to which parallelized Tasks can be assigned to it by the Driver."
    - content: "The Driver and the Executor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is only one driver in a cluster. Therefore, work cannot be parallelized at this level."
    - content: "The Slot and the Task"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tasks represent the work that is being parallelized across executors."
  - content: "What type of process are the driver and the executors?"
    choices:
    - content: "Java processes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The driver and the executors are Java processes."
    - content: "Python processes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The driver and executors are NOT Python processes."
    - content: "C++ processes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The driver and executors are NOT C++ processes."
