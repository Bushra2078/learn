Suppose you're working for a data analytics startup that's now expanding along with its increasing customer base. You receive customer data from multiple sources in different raw formats. To efficiently handle huge amounts of customer data, your company has decided to invest in Azure Databricks. Your team is responsible to prepare the data for advanced analytics and machine learning operations. As part of feature engineering, there are specific column-level transformations you need to perform that are not supported by the built-in functions. You are looking to see how User Defined Functions (UDF) can help you achieve your complex and custom data processing logic.
