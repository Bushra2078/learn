In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **09-Building-And-Querying-A-Delta-Lake** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2.Delta-Lake-Basics-Lab-1** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

In this exercise, you:

- Create a new Delta Lake from aggregate data of an existing Delta Lake.
- UPSERT records into a Delta lake.
- Append new data to an existing Delta Lake.

The instructions are provided within the notebook, along with empty cells for you to do your work. At the bottom of the notebook are additional cells that will help verify that your work is accurate.

> [!Note]
> You will find a corresponding notebook within the `Solutions` subfolder. This contains completed cells for the exercise. Refer to the notebook if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
