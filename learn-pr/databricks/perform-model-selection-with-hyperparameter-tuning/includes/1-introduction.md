Imagine that you work as a data scientist for a Bike Share company. You team has started experimenting with machine learning algorithms to predict seasonal, bike rental demand. The initial experiments are showing that the model performs well on the training dataset, however, the performance degrades as you test the model on new unseen data. Your next task is to fine tune the model so that it generalizes and prevents overfitting the training dataset.
