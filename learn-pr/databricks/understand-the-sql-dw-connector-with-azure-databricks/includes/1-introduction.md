Suppose you work in the analytics department of a large retail warehouse. Your organization's IT infrastructure is cloud-based and all data, including customer orders and product information, are stored in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Your department is responsible to analyze customer shopping trends and propose future promotions based on your findings. You've heard about the robust machine learning and deep learning functions of Azure Databricks. However, you are not sure if it's compatible to work with Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Your manager has asked you explore Azure SQl Data Warehouse and Databricks connectivity options.

Azure Databricks is Apache Sparkâ€“based analytics platform that supports SQL analytics and can be integrated with SQL Data Warehouse to run high-performance analytics. It allows faster interactive processing of batch and streaming data with built-in functions for machine learning and big data processing.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Access Azure SQL Data Warehouse (SQL DW) from Azure Databricks using the SQL Data Warehouse connector.
- Use Apache Spark with Azure Blob storage and PolyBase in SQL DW to transfer large volumes of data efficiently between a Databricks cluster and a SQL DW instance.
