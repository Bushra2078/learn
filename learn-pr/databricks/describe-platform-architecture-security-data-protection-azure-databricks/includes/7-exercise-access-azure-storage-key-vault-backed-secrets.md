In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **08-Azure-Databricks-Security-Data-Protection** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **3-Key-Vault-Backed-Secret-Scopes** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Create a Secret Scope connected to Azure Key Vault
- Mount Blob Storage to DBFS using a SAS token
- Write data to Blob using a SAS token in Spark Configuration

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
