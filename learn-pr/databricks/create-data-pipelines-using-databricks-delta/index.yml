title: Create data pipelines using Databricks Delta
summary: Learn how to use Databricks Delta in Azure to manage the flow of data (data pipeline) to and from a data lake. This includes mechanisms to create, append, and upsert data to Spark tables, taking advantage of built-in reliability and optimizations. Learn about Databricks Delta architecture, and how it helps speed up reads and allows multiple writers to simultaneously modify a data set and see consistent views. Finally, implement a lambda architecture by processing batch and streaming data with Delta.
