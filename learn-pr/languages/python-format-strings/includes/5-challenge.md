Throughout these modules, code challenges reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

### Step 1 - Add a new file in your working directory for this challenge

Use the techniques you learned in previous modules to add a new code file in the current folder dedicated to this module. For example, you might create a file named `challenge.py`.

### Step 2 - Use string manipulation and formatting techniques you learned to create the challenge output

Copy the following code into your new file. Then modify it by adding new code to satisfy the requirements of the challenge.

```python
first_value = '  FIRST challenge         '
second_value = '-  second challenge  -'
third_value = 'tH IR D-C HALLE NGE'

fourth_value = 'fourth'
fifth_value = 'fifth'
sixth_value = 'sixth'

# First challenge


# Second challenge


# Third challenge


print(first_value)
print(second_value)
print(third_value)

# Fourth challenge - use only the print() function (no f-strings)


# Fifth challenge - use only a single print() function.  Create tabs and new lines using f-strings.


```

Using techniques you learned in this module, manipulate and format strings to produce the following output.

```output
       First Challenge        
Second challenge
               Third challenge
fourth#fifth#sixth!
        fourth
        fifth
        sixth
```

There's likely more than one right way to accomplish this. But you do need to follow two rules:

Rule #1: You may only *add* code. You may not delete or modify the existing starter code, except to add new lines of code.

Rule #2: Your output must match the challenge output exactly.

> [!Important]
> Read the instructions in the code comments closely, and observe the desired output closely. For example, count spacing, and look for uppercase versus lowercase.
