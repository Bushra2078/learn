Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

## Challenge - Build a calorie counter

In this challenge, you build a calorie counter that prompts the user for:

- The current date (in any format)
- Breakfast calories eaten
- Lunch calories eaten
- Dinner calories eaten
- Snack calories eaten

The program will then sum up all of the calories and format them into a message.

Here's an example of the output from running the program:

```output
Today's date?
Thursday
Breakfast calories?
100
Lunch calories?
200
Dinner calories?
300
Snack calories?
400
Calorie content for Thursday: 1000
```

## Requirements

To solve the challenge, you need to perform the following tasks:

### Task 1 - Create a new file for your challenge

You can call your new file anything you want.  Just make sure that you're comfortable creating a new *.py* file and adding code to it.

### Task 2 - Write the necessary Python code to duplicate the example output

To build the program, use the techniques that you learned earlier.  If you get stuck, focus on just one part at a time.  For example, first collect and display only the date information.  Then move on to the next tiny step, collecting the breakfast calories information and displaying that.  By breaking up one large problem into many smaller programs and testing your work along the way to make sure that it still works, your approach to problem solving will match that of most software developers.

No matter how you approach writing your code, it should produce the following output, depending on the values you enter when you're prompted:

```output
Today's date?
December 7th, 2020
Breakfast calories?
250
Lunch calories?
300
Dinner calories?
500
Snack calories?
150
Calorie content for December 7th, 2020: 1200
```
