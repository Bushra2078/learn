A common goal of many programs is to take input, process it, format it, and then output it in some way.  In this module, you'll write Python code to perform each of these tasks.  Along the way, you'll learn many foundational ideas, such as working with data, performing operations on data, retrieving input, generating output, and more.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build simple applications that can accept user input, combine that input with literal text, and output the result to the user.  More importantly, you'll have taken vital first steps toward learning Python.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create Python code files and execute that code in Visual Studio Code.
- Write code to send a text message to the command line.
- Write code to accept user input from the command line.
- Understand why compilation and runtime errors occur, and what to do next.
- Concatenate hard-coded text with user input to display custom-formatted messages to the user.
- Perform mathematical addition on numeric data.
- Convert alphanumeric data into numeric data and back again.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Visual Studio Code installed
- Python tools for Visual Studio Code installed, including all recommended tools, such as Pylint

If you need help with installing these prerequisites, follow the instructions in the module "Set up your Python beginner development environment with Visual Studio Code."
