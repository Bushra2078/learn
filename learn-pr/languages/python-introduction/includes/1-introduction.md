The Python programming language lets you build many types of programs, like:

- business applications to capture, analyze, and process data
- dynamic web applications that can be accessed from a web browser
- games, both 2D and 3D
- financial and scientific applications
- cloud-based applications
- mobile applications

As programming languages go, Python is relatively simple yet powerful, which likely has contributed to its enormous popularity. Beyond the programming language itself, Python boasts a wealth of third-party libraries that can reduce complex tasks into a few lines of code.

In this module, we start by explaining the most basic concepts to make sure you have a firm grasp on how programming works. We'll discuss the role of a programming language's syntax, the need for compilation and interpretation, the process of programming, and finally the tools you'll need to build your own software development environment.

## What's the best way to learn Python?

By far, the best way to learn how to build programs by writing Python code is to write as much Python code as possible. Soon, we'll work through dozens of small code examples. When we get to that point, we encourage you to type along with the exercises. Completing the exercises and solving small coding challenges will accelerate your learning.

But first, we'll cover some high-level conceptual information and in the next module, help you install and configure the tools you'll need to get started.

Once we help you get oriented in the right direction, we'll start writing code. Continual practice and exploration by completing exercises and challenges reinforces small foundational concepts that you'll build on throughout your entire career.

Let's start with the most basic question: what exactly is Python?  To understand what Python is and what it does, you need to understand how a programming language provides a way for a human to communicate instructions with a computer.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn what a programming language does, and why Python is so popular and is a great choice as your first programming language to learn.
- Learn why you must compile your code into computer-understandable format.
- Learn the process of programming and the software tools you must install.
