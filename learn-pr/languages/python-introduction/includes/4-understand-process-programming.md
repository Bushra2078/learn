Whether you're writing Python code for fun, or to automate some part of your job, or to analyze data, or your work on a team to build a large-scale application for your company, you'll wind up following similar steps.  In this unit, we'll look at the process of programming and the tools you'll need to create your first programs with Python.

## What is the process of programming?

What prompts software developers to write code in the first place?  Typically, software developers jump into action to address a need or problem that requires a solution.  

As you're getting started, the need could be an assignment or coding challenge for a course.  As you begin to move past learning, the need will likely come in the form of some business problem that needs to be automated.  

Building a new program follows predictable set of actions:

- **Analyze** requirements - The first step is to understand the problem you're trying to solve.  How you begin depends on whether you're building the program to satisfy a teacher, a client or yourself.  Typically, it means you want to totally immerse yourself in the problem by asking critical questions about what the problem is, reading any communications or notes available, and so on.
- **Design** a solution - Next, you begin to think about the program's appearance, its functionality, what happens when an unexpected problem arises, and so on.  You may draw diagrams, take notes, or mentally visualize the design of the program.  You may begin to imagine the approach you'll take to certain challenges in your code.
- **Write** code - You'll spend the most time writing code that realizes the design you created.
- **Test** your code - As you're writing code, you'll likely be testing to see if the code you wrote works.  Later, you may add more formal testing, even involving end users.
- **Deploy** your code - You'll distribute your code to others so they can begin using it to solve the problem (or if you're in a classroom, you may need to send your code to the instructor, which is a form of deployment).
- **Maintain** your code - Over time, the users of your program may ask for new features or report bugs in your program.  You fix the issues and redistribute your code to your users.

Again, no matter whether you'll be the only user or you work in a large team and distribute your program to thousands of users, the basic process is the same.  Writing code is important, but it's not the only step -- even when you're solving coding challenges or assignments for a class!

Most tutorials and classes usually focus on writing code.  This is probably because it's both the hardest and the most fun.  It's also the activity that requires a deep amount of knowledge about to complete.  This step has its own process:

- Focus on some small part of the larger problem.
- Write code to implement that small part.
- Run the program and watch it work.  If it doesn't work, figure out why.
- Re-write the code to fix any issues.
- Keep repeating this process until you're done.

It's the last part, often called "iterating", is popular in software development.  Rarely does anyone write more than a few lines of code before running the program to see if the code they write actually does what they wanted it to do, and to see where they went wrong.  Fixing a problem in your code is as easy as typing a editing a document.  It's like driving a car -- you make a thousand small course corrections until you get to your destination.  While it can seem daunting at first, when compared to jobs like pilot, surgeon, or construction worker, software developers can make lots of mistakes along the way and still be good at what they do.

## What programming tools should I use?

While you could use a basic text editor like Windows Notepad or Vim in your macOS or Linux terminal along with the Python compiler and interpreter, you'll have a better experience with a dedicated code editor.

Here's the tools you'll want to use as you're getting started:

**Python** - The Python installer contains many utilities and features, but most importantly: the Python runtime (the compiler and interpreter) and the Python Standard Library, which is a large collection of code that implements common functionality so you don't have to.  We'll devote entire modules to exploring this library of code soon.

**Visual Studio Code** - While you can use a basic text editor to write code, a dedicated code editor like Visual Studio code will enable you to manage your code files, provide helpful visual hints as you're coding, and much more.

**Python Extension for Visual Studio Code** - The Python Extension will enhance the default Visual Studio Code experience by customizing it to help you write Python.

Collectively, these software tools are typically referred to as your "developer environment".  In the next module, we'll walk you through the steps to install the software tools you'll need to start programming with Python.
