Our goal was to write Python code that could handle data that was unusable for the purpose of converting to numeric values and performing mathematical operations.

Using built-in functions to understand the contents of the user input, as well as the `if ... elif ... else` statement, we were able to write code that could analyze the data types of values, and use Boolean expressions to branch code, and use different mathematical operators to perform a wide range of operations.

We can now accept user input confidently knowing that we can inspect and understand the content of the end users' input before utilizing it in our programming logic.
