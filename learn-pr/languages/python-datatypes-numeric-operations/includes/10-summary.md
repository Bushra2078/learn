Your goal in this module was to write Python code that can handle data that's unusable for the purpose of converting to numeric values and performing mathematical operations.

By using built-in functions to understand the contents of the user input, as well as the `if ... elif ... else` statement, you were able to write code that analyzes the data types of values, use Boolean expressions to branch code, and use various mathematical operators to perform a wide range of operations.

You can now accept user input confidently, knowing that you can inspect and understand its content before you utilize it in your programming logic.
