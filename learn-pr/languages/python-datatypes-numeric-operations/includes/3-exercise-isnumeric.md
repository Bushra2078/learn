In the previous module, we built an example that allowed an end user to input two values that we would add together by converting those values using the `int()` function.

```python
first_value = int(input('First Number: '))
second_value = int(input('Second number: '))
sum = first_number + second_number
print("Sum: " + str(sum))
```
As we pointed out in the introduction of this module, it's possible that our end user will enter a value that cannot be converted to a numeric data type.  Consider what happens when an end-user types in the value `Bob` instead of a numeric value.

```output
First Number: 6
Second Number: Bob
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:/python/numeric-operations-datatypes/exercise1.py", line 2, in <module>
    second_number = int(input())
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Bob'
```

### What did we do wrong?

We only accounted for the best case scenario: that the end user would enter a value within a certain range of values, namely, a numeric value.  However, developers learn to consider the possibility that all input from users or other system (including files generated by other programs) could be out of the acceptable range of values.  Sometimes, we call this "treating input as evil" ... the programming equivalent to "defensive driving".  

Armed with a healthy skepticism, we need to perform data type and value checks on the data before actually performing operations on or with the data.

### How can we fix this?

In this exercise, we'll write code that will take the first step towards determining the right course of action -- if the value cannot be converted into a number, we need to stop the program, tell the user that the value they entered is invalid, and ask them to try again.  

To do this, we'll need to learn more about data types, built-in functions that allow us to determine the data type of a value, and how to work with Boolean expressions as a pre-cursor to testing values and branching our code to handle scenarios where our data is not able to be used as is.

### What steps can we take to solve the problem?

In the situation described at the beginning of this unit, we described the fundamental problem as an issue of trust.  We trusted that the user would input a value that could be used as a number.

To remedy this, we need to perform a few additional steps.  First, we should check the user's input to see if it can
be converted into an `int`.  If it can be converted, then go ahead and convert it.  However, if it can't be converted, we need to explain the problem to the end user.

So, how can we know if the user's input is numeric, even though the `input()` function always returns a string value?  And moreover, how can we determine the data type of a value?

## The `isnumeric()` function

At the outset, we wanted a way to determine if the value input by an end user could be converted into a numeric value so that we can perform mathematical operations on it.  The `isnumeric()` returns a Boolean value if the string value can be converted into a numeric value.

### Step 1 - Create a new python code file.

Assuming you're continuing from the previous unit, use the techniques you learned in previous modules to add a new code file in the current folder dedicated to this module.  For example, you might create a new file named `exercise2.py`.

### Step 2 - Add code that uses the `isnumeric()` function to determine if a string can be converted into a number.

Add the follow code to the new code file:

```python
numeric_value = '7'
print(numeric_value.isnumeric())

string_value = 'Bob'
print(string_value.isnumeric())
```

Notice that the `isnumeric()` function works differently from other functions we've used so far.  We access the function using the member accessor operator `.`, a period character.  This simply means that the function is not general purpose, and can only be used on a string data type.  Admittedly, there's a bit more to it than that, but we'll learn more about class members in an upcoming module.

Functions that supply additional functionality and are accessible to any value of a given data type are called "helper functions" because they are built-in *helpers* that help us use or understand more about the contents of the string value itself.

If you execute this code, you'll see the following output:

```output
True
False
```

Both `numeric_value` and `string_value` point to string values, but the `isnumeric()` function tells us that one of these (`numeric_value`) could be converted and used as an `int` or `float` data type.  We'll use this in a moment to build a more robust program that accepts user input for mathematical processing.

### Other is__() functions

Python's `str` data type supports many similar helper functions.  Some of the most useful ones (as you're getting started) include:

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
|`isalnum()`|Use this to make sure the string has no special symbols, like `%`, `$`, `#`, `@`, `!` |
|`isalpha()`|Use this to make sure the string only contains letters in the alphabet|
|`isdecimal()`|Use this to make sure the string only contains decimal values (numbers)|
|`istitle()`|Use this to make sure the string follows the rules of capitalization (like in a sentence)|
|`isupper()`|Use this to make sure the string only has uppercase letters|
|`islower()`|Use this to make sure the string only has lowercase letters|

We'll work with some of these functions in another module devoted to working with strings.

## Combining `isnumeric()` with the `if` statement

In the previous module, we used the `if ... elif ... else` statement to branch code execution.  Now, let's apply combine what we've already learned about user input, data types, and the `isnumeric()` helper function to check whether user input could be converted before actually attempting the conversion.

The `if` statement will allow us to perform a "gate" on the input.  A "gate" is a programming term referring to a check on data to make sure it is in the proper format before continuing.

### Step 3 - Comment out code from the previous steps, then rewrite the code to gate the keyboard input using and `if` statement and the `isnumeric()` function.

Update your code to match the following code listing:

```python
first_value = input('First Number: ')

if first_value.isnumeric() == False:
    print('Value is not a number.')
    exit()

second_value = input('Second Number: ')

if second_value.isnumeric() == False:
    print('Value is not a number.')
    exit()

first_value = int(first_value)
second_value = int(second_value)

sum = first_value + second_value
print('Sum: ' + str(sum))
```
Here we use `isnumeric()` looking for the Boolean expression to return a `False`.  If that is `True` (in other words, if `isnumeric()` is, in fact, `False`) then we print a message and `exit()`.  Otherwise, we continue on with the program.

The `exit()` method will terminate the program immediately.  This is useful when you want to end the program without processing any additional lines of code.  In this case, we want to end the program when we know the conversion of the end user's input to `int` will be unsuccessful.  When we learn about looping structures in Python, we can repeatedly prompt the user for a different value until they enter a numeric value.

If you execute the code and provide numeric answers to the `input()`, it should return a valid sum of the numbers.

```output
First Number: 4
Second Number: 5
Sum: 9
```
If you execute the code and provide non-numeric answers to the prompts, you'll get a predictable response as the program ends.

```output
First Number: 5
Second Number: bob
Value is not a number.
```
There's no doubt that the "gated" approach requires more lines of code.  However, our program is more resilient and less likely to raise an error in real world usage.  We could likely reduce the lines of code slightly by combining both of our calls to `isnumeric()` on the same line of code using the `or` operator.

### Step 4 - Update the code example to use the logical `or` operator.

Update the code example to use the logical `or` operator.  Make sure your code matches the following code listing:

```python
first_value = input('First Number: ')
second_value = input('Second Number: ')

if first_value.isnumeric() == False or second_value.isnumeric() == False:
    print('Please enter numbers only.')
    exit()

first_value = int(first_value)
second_value = int(second_value)

sum = first_value + second_value
print('Sum: ' + str(sum))
```
Execute the application a few times trying different combinations to test your changes.

## Recap

- The `isnumeric()` will allow you to check to see if a value could be converted to an `int` or `float`.
- The `isnumeric()` function is an example of a "helper method" because it supports the use of a data type like `str`.  You access these types of function using the **member accessor operator** `.`, which is a period symbol.
- Use the `exit()` function to end execution of your program immediately.
- Sometimes, the logical `or` operator can be used to reduce the amount of code you have to write to implement your gated checks.
- A "helper function" operates on a value of a given type, providing helpful utilities that allow you to perform common operations on values belonging to that data type.
- Every data type supports some "helper methods".  We briefly looked at a few `str` helper methods that help us understand the contents of our string values.
