In this second challenge, you'll combine what you learned about accepting user input and performing data conversions with what you previously learned about the `if...elif...else` statement.

You will build a limited calculator application that prompts the user for two values and a mathematical operation,  performs the calculation, then formats and displays the output.

### Step 1: Add a new file to your working folder.

Assuming you're continuing from the previous unit, use the techniques you learned in previous modules to add a new code file in the current folder dedicated to this module.  For example, you might create a file named `challenge2.py`.

Use this file for the code you'll write in Step 2.

### Step 2: Write a program to accept two numbers and an operation, then perform the operation on the two numbers.

Build a simple calculator that accepts a first number, an operation, and a second number.

Here's an example output, given that the user entered `4`, `*`, and `5` respectively when prompted:

```output
Simple calculator!
First number? 4
Operation? *
Second number? 5
product of 4 * 5 equals 20
```

Your program should accept a symbol, like the `*` to perform a multiplication, and produce a product.  Make sure you implement logic for the following results:

- sum
- difference
- product
- quotient
- exponent
- modulus

If the user fails to enter a numeric value, display the message:

```output
Please input a number.
```

If the operation entered by the end user is not recognized, you should display the message:

```output
Operation not recognized.
```
