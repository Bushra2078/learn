In addition to branching code execution, often it's necessary to repeat code execution until a certain condition is met. This process is called iteration in programming terminology.

Suppose you need to prompt a user for input, and you continue prompting them until they enter a value that's within an acceptable range of values. Or suppose you need to read each line of a data file until you reach the end of the file. In these situations, you'll use the `while` statement, which creates a looping structure in your code. With a `while` statement, the code execution iterates until a condition is met, at which point the path of execution continues through the remainder of your program.

In this module, you'll use the `while` statement to iterate through a code block. You'll add other statements like `break`, `continue`, and `else` to further control the flow of code execution. You'll use new assignment operators to perform mathematical operations that also assign the new value back into the variable--a frequent pattern in many looping statements.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build programs that control the flow of code with looping structures.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Use the `while` statement to iterate through a code block.
- Use the `break`, `continue`, and `else` statements to further control iteration.
- Use alternate assignment operators to perform mathematical operations that also assign values.

## Prerequisites

- You should have your Python development environment set up, know how to create a working folder and code files, and know how to run the code in a code file.
- You should understand data types like `str` and `int` and know how to define, set, and get values from a variable.
- You should understand what a code block is and how to define one.
- You should understand how to include a module from the Python Standard Library.
- You should have experience using if statements and the string's `isnumeric()` helper method to evaluate user input.
