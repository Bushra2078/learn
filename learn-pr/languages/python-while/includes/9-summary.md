Our goal was to build a looping structure in Python to iterate through a code block as long as a condition was met.

Using the `while` statement, we implemented a loop that would continue to execute a code block as long as a Boolean expression evaluated to `True`.  We used the `else` statement to perform a code block once the Boolean expression evaluated to `False`, and added the `break` statement to exit the code block entirely.  We added a `continue` statement to modify the set the execution path back to the evaluation of the `while` statement's Boolean expression.  We also used new assignment operators to add simple increments and decrements to our programs.
