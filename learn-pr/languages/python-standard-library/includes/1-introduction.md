The Python programming language also includes a library of functionality that you can use in your own programs.  Furthermore, it includes tools that allow you to install additional third-party open-source projects that dramatically speed and simplify Python development.

Imagine that you've been asked to create a program that scrapes data from the internet, processes the information, then saves the data to a file and uses the FTP Internet protocol to send that file to a client's server.  If you had to program every detail yourself, it would take a long time.  Fortunately, you can leverage the work of others who have already written code to make this entire program possible, even trivial.

In this module, you will discover the Python Standard Library.  You'll learn how you can leverage thousands of pre-built functions spread over hundreds of modules.  You'll learn how to extend that to leverage the work of the wider software development community who has created hundreds of thousands of Python packages that can perform every conceivable need.  You'll learn where you can go to research available packages, how to install these packages locally and include them into your code.

By the end of  this module, you will be able to write programs that can harness the power of the Python Standard Library and the Python community's body of work.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Explore the Python Standard Library
- Add the `include` statement to tell the Python compiler which modules you will use in your code
- Use the pip utility to download third-party open-source packages

## Prerequisites

- You should have your Python development environment setup.
- You should understand basic data types like strings and `int`, how to create, set and get values from a variable, and so on.
- Experience calling methods using the member access operator `.` and passing arguments to functions.
