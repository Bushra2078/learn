Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

In this challenge, you'll use what you've learned about user input and performing mathematical operations on 

### Step 1: Add a new file to your working folder.

Assuming you're continuing from the previous unit, use the techniques you learned in previous modules to add a new code file in the current folder dedicated to this module.  For example, you might create a file named `challenge1.py`.

Use this file for the code you'll write in Step 2.

### Step 2: Write a program to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

The mathematical formula for converting a temperature measured in Fahrenheit to a temperature measured in Celsius:

```
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
```

Use this formula to build a program that prompts the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit, performs the conversion to Celsius, then displays the temperature to the end user.

The interaction between the user and the program should match the following output (given that the end user enters the value `55` when prompted):

```output
What is the temperature in fahrenheit?  55
Temperature in celsius is 12
```

However, if the end user inputs a bad value, the program should tell the user that there's a problem and exit.  For this scenario, your program should match the following output (given that the end user enters the value 'bob' when prompted.)

```output
What is the temperature in fahrenheit?  bob
Input is not a number.
```

![Note]
To double-check your work, find a temperature converter online and make sure your results from your program matches their results.
