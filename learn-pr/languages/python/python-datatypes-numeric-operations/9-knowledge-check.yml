  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which function should you use when you want to evaluate whether or not a value is of type string?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `isstring()` function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no `isstring()` function"
    - content: "The `type()` function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `type()` function only returns the type.  It does not evaluate the type to see if it matches some type like `str`."
    - content: "The `instanceof()` function."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Choose `instanceof()` when you want to evaluate whether or not a value is of a certain type."
    - content: "The `isnumeric()` function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `isnumeric()` function will not allow you to evaluate whether or not a value is of type string."
  - content: "You want to determine if one number divides evenly into another.  Which operator would you use for that?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `/` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Simple division alone will not answer this question."
    - content: "The `^` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `^` symbol is not used in Python."
    - content: "The `&` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `&` symbol is used for bitwise operations and will not answer this question."
    - content: "The `%` operator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If the modulus is `0` then the divisor divides evenly into the dividend."
  - content: "Suppose you have a value `1.468` in a variable called `apr` and you want to round it to `1.5`.  How would you call the `round()` method?"
    choices:
    - content: "round(apr)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct."
    - content: "round(apr, 0)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct."
    - content: "round(apr, 1)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "round(apr, 2)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is not correct."
