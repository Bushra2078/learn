  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You have a five item list and you want to retrieve the last three items.  Which slice will accomplish that?"
    choices:
    - content: "my_list[1:4]"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This will select the middle three items."
    - content: "my_list[:2]"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This will select the first two items."
    - content: "my_list[:-3]"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This will select the first two items."
    - content: "my_list[-3:]"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following helper functions allow me to simulate a queue with my list?"
    choices:
    - content: "remove()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The remove() function removes the item from the list, but it's not the best choice."
    - content: "pop()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The pop() function selects and removes an item from a list.  This is similar to how a queue operates."
    - content: "del()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no `del()` function."
    - content: "clear()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The clear() function removes all the items."
  - content: "What's the easiest way to tell if a value belongs to a list?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the `find()` helper function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no `find()` helper function on lists."
    - content: "Use the `in` operator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use the `is` operator."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `is` checks to see if two objects are the same object.  That won't help us in this case."
    - content: "Use the `contains()` helper method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A list does not have a helper method named `contains()`."
