Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

### Step 1: Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise.

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor then select the `del` or backspace key to delete it.

### Step 2: Write code to create a list containing a standard deck of cards.

Using the technique from the previous unit to create every combination of suit and rank to create an entire set of 52 cards.  Instead of just printing the value of the card, add the card to a list that represents a deck of cards.

When you're complete, display the number of cards in the deck using the function that provides a count of items in the list.

```output
There are 52 cards in the deck.
```

### Step 3: Write code to randomly choose five cards from the deck and add to a player's hand.

Next, create a second list that will contain the result of a "deal" ... to simulate dealing five random cards, use the appropriate method to choose a card.  Make sure you add the card to the list representing the player's hand, and remove it from the list representing the deck.

Before simulating the deal, print the message:

```output
Dealing ...
```

After simulating the deal, print out the number of cards in the list representing the deck.  Finally, print out the cards in the player's hand.

When complete, you should see the following output (given that each time there's likely to be different randomly dealt cards):

```output
There are 52 cards in the deck.
Dealing ...
There are 47 cards in the deck.
Player has the following cards in their hand:
['Jack of Hearts', 'Queen of Hearts', '4 of Spades', 'Ace of Hearts', '9 of Diamonds']
```
