The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```python
import random

suits = ["Hearts", "Spades", "Clubs", "Diamonds"]
ranks = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace"]
deck = []

for  suit in suits:
  for rank in ranks:
    deck.append(f'{rank} of {suit}')

print(f'There are {len(deck)} cards in the deck.')

print('Dealing ...')

hand = []

while len(hand) < 5:
    card = random.choice(deck)
    deck.remove(card)
    hand.append(card)

print(f'There are {len(deck)} cards in the deck.')
print('Player has the following cards in their hand:')
print(hand)
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*".  As long as you matched the output, and each time you execute the program you get a different set of cards dealt to the player, then you were successful.

If you were successful, congratulations!  Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
