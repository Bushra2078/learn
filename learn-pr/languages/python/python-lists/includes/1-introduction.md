Often when you're building programs in Python, you'll need to work with a set of data, not just one element.  Python has several different ways to work with a collection of data.  One of the most simple and versatile is the list.  Once you have your collection of data in a list, you can access any individual item or a subset of items, perform operations like sorting and reversing the order, you can iterate through the items and more.

Suppose you need to keep track of messages and numeric output that is generated as output from another software system.  You want to look through each value, filtering out some values, saving other values, and so on.  In this case, you would want to manage all of that data in a structure like a list.

In this module, you will create and initialize values in a list.  You'll access individual elements in the list and entire subsets of values in the list.  You'll call helper functions on the list to perform operations like adding or removing items, sorting, and so on.  You'll use the `for` statement to iterate through your list and operate on each element in the list, and more.

By the end of this module, you will be able to control the data you store in a list.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create lists containing related data.
- Get an item or a subset of items from the list using indices and slices.
- Add and remove items from the list and other list related actions using helper functions.
- Iterate through the list using the `for` iteration statement.

## Prerequisites:

- You should have your local Python development setup and are able to create a working folder for your code, add code files, and execute those code files from the command line or your code editor.
- You should know how to work with data types like `str` and `int`, know how to work with variables, and so on.
- You should be familiar with importing the `random` module and how to call functions from that module like `randint()`.
