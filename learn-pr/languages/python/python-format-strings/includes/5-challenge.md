Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

### Step 1 - Add a new file in your working directory for this challenge.

For example, you might create the following file:

```dos
challenge.py
```

### Step 2 - Use string manipulation and formatting techniques you learned to create the challenge output.

Copy the following code into your new file, then modify it by adding new code to satisfy the requirements of the challenge.

```python
first_value = '  FIRST challenge         '
second_value = '-  second challenge  -'
third_value = 'tH IR D-C HALLE NGE'

fourth_value = 'fourth'
fifth_value = 'fifth'
sixth_value = 'sixth'

# First challenge


# Second challenge


# Third challenge


print(first_value)
print(second_value)
print(third_value)

# Fourth challenge - use only the print() function (no f-strings)


# Fifth challenge - use only a single print() function.  Create tabs and new lines using f-strings.


```

Using techniques you learned in this module, manipulate and format strings to produce the following output.

```output
       First Challenge        
Second challenge
               Third challenge
fourth#fifth#sixth!
        fourth
        fifth
        sixth
```

There's likely more than one right way to accomplish this, however, you must follow two rules:

Rule #1: You may only add code.  You may not delete or modify the existing starter code (above) except to add new lines of code.

Rule #2: Your output must match the challenge output (above) exactly.

![Important]
Read the instructions in the code comments closely and observe the desired output closely.  Count spacing, looking for upper case versus lower case, and so on.
