Our goal in this module was to manage values in a list. We managed values to:

- Work with the values in aggregate.
- Filter and sort the list.
- Add and remove items from the list.
- Iterate through the list.  

We used Python syntax to initialize a new list and retrieve one or more items from the list. 

We used helper methods to:

- Append and remove items from the list. 
- Sort the list.
- Reverse the items in the list.
- Clear the list. 

We used the `for` statement to iterate through each item in the list and process the list in the code block that followed.  

Finally, we learned how to choose randomly from a list and to evaluate whether a value belonged to the list.
