Our goal was to manage values in a list, allowing us to work with the values in aggregate, filter and sort the list, add and remove items from the list, and iterate through the list.  Utilizing Python syntax, we were able to initialize a new list and retrieve one or more items from the list.  Using helper methods, we appended and removed items from the list, sort the list, reverse the items in the list, and clear the list entirely.  Using the `for` statement, we were able to iterate through each item in the list, processing it in the code block below.  We learned how to make random choices from a list, and evaluate whether a value belonged to the list.
