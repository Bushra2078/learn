Often when you build programs in Python, you need to work with a whole set of data, not just one element. In Python, you can work with a collection of data in several ways.  One of the most simple and versatile ways is the list.  When your data collection is in a list, you can access an individual item or a subset of items, sort and reverse the list order, iterate through the items, and more.

Suppose you need to keep track of the messages and numeric output that another software system generates.  You want to look through each value, filtering out some values, saving other values, and so on.  In this case, you can manage all of that data in a structure like a list.

In this module, you'll create and initialize values in a list.  You'll access individual elements and entire subsets of values in the list.  You'll call helper functions to perform operations like adding, removing, or sorting items. And you'll use the `for` statement to iterate through your list and operate on each element in the list.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to control the data that you store in a list.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create lists that contain related data.
- Use indices and slices to get an item or a subset of items from the list.
- Use helper functions to add and remove items from the list and to do other list-related actions.
- Iterate through the list by using the `for` statement.

## Prerequisites

- A local Python development setup where you can create a working folder for your code, add code files, and execute those code files from the command line or your code editor.
- Experience with data types like `str` and `int`, variables, and so on.
- Familiarity with importing the `random` module and how to call module functions like `randint()`.
