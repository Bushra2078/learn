Our goal was to use functions to help alleviate the pain of writing and managing hundreds or thousands of lines of code when working on large programs.

We defined Python functions to encapsulate functionality into its own named code block.  We added input parameters to add a degree of flexibility to our functions.  We assigned default values to input parameters, and learned how to whether our input parameters have a value by comparing to `None`.  We defined functions that could accept a variable number of input parameters, both unnamed and named.  We defined functions that could return a result after the code logic processed the input.  Finally, we added functions to modules, and imported modules into our code.

Without functions and modules, it would be impossible to build larger, more interesting programs.
