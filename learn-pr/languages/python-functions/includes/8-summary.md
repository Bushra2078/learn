Our goal was for you to use functions that help you write and manage hundreds or thousands of lines of code when you work on large programs.

In this module, you:

- Defined Python functions to encapsulate functionality into its own named code block.
- Added input parameters to add a degree of flexibility to your functions.
- Assigned default values to input parameters and learned how to tell whether the input parameters have a value by comparing them to **None**.
- Defined functions that could accept a variable number of input parameters, both unnamed and named. 
- Defined functions that could return a result after the code logic processed the input.
- Added functions to modules and imported modules into your code.

Without functions and modules, it would be impossible to build larger, more interesting programs.
