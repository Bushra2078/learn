Larger programs could require hundreds, thousands, or even millions of lines of code.  Once your program starts growing to about 50 lines of code, you'll start to realize that you need a better way to reorganize the code.  Perhaps you find yourself writing (or copying and pasting) the same five or six lines of code in multiple places throughout your code.  What if that code needs to change, whether because it is faulty logic or a change to the requirements?  You'll need to search through your entire program and make changes in multiple places.

Functions can alleviate your pain.  They are one of the first building blocks you'll learn about to help you build and maintain larger programs.

In this module, you'll build functions that accept input arguments and return values.  You'll learn advanced techniques to build functions that can accept many different types of input.  And finally, you'll build  modules that host functions that you can import into your programs.

By the end of this module, you will be able to create functions and modules to help manage the code as you build larger programs.

Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Define functions that encapsulate functionality.
- Add input parameters to functions so that they can be called using input arguments.
- Return values from functions.
- Create modules to host functions that can be imported into another code file.

Prerequisites:

- You should have a local Python development environment setup to run Python 3 using a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
- You should know how to execute a code script using the command line or functionality from your local Python development environment.
- Basic Python knowledge including an understanding of types, variables, value assignment, calling functions, passing arguments, and importing modules.
