Large programs can require hundreds, thousands, or even millions of lines of code.

After your program grows to about 50 lines of code, you'll need a better way to organize it.

Assume you write or paste the same code in multiple places throughout your program. What if that repeated code needs to change because of either faulty logic or changed requirements? You'd need to search through your entire program and make changes in multiple places.

Functions can lessen your pain. They're one of the first building blocks you'll learn to help you build and maintain larger programs.

In this module, you'll build functions that accept input arguments and return values. You'll learn advanced techniques to build functions that can accept many different input types. And finally, you'll build modules that host functions that you can import into your programs.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create functions and modules to help manage your code as you build larger programs.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Define functions that encapsulate functionality.
- Add input parameters to functions so that they can be called using input arguments.
- Return values from functions.
- Create modules to host functions that can be imported into other code files.

## Prerequisites

- A local Python development environment set up to run Python 3 using a code editor like Visual Studio Code
- Knowledge of how to run a code script using either a command line or your local Python development environment
- Basic Python knowledge that includes an understanding of types, variables, value assignment, function calls, passing arguments, and module import
