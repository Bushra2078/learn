Large programs can require hundreds, thousands, or even millions of lines of code. After one of your programs grows to about 50 lines of code, you'll start to realize that you need a better way to organize it.

Perhaps you find yourself writing or copying and pasting the same five or six lines of code in multiple places throughout your program. What if that repeated code needs to change, whether because it has faulty logic or because the requirements changed? You'd need to search through your entire program and make changes in multiple places.

Functions can lessen your pain. They are one of the first building blocks you'll learn to help you build and maintain larger programs.

In this module, you'll build functions that accept input arguments and return values. You'll learn advanced techniques to build functions that can accept many different types of input. And finally, you'll build  modules that host functions that you can import into your programs.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create functions and modules to help manage your code as you build larger programs.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Define functions that encapsulate functionality.
- Add input parameters to functions so that they can be called using input arguments.
- Return values from functions.
- Create modules to host functions that can be imported into another code file.

Prerequisites:

- A local Python development environment set up to run Python 3 using a code editor like Visual Studio Code
- Knowledge of how to execute a code script using either the command line or your local Python development environment
- Basic Python knowledge including an understanding of types, variables, value assignment, calling functions, passing arguments, and importing modules
