The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

First, you should create a new code file named processor.py in the same working directory.

Then in that file, you should create the following two functions:

```python
def process_numbers(unprocessed_list):
    
    processed_list = []
    if isinstance(unprocessed_list, list) == False:
        return processed_list
    
    for item in unprocessed_list:
        if isinstance(item, int):
            processed_list.append(item)
        elif isinstance(item, str):
            if item.isnumeric():
                converted_item = int(item)
                processed_list.append(converted_item)
    
    processed_list.sort()
    return processed_list


def process_names(unprocessed_list):
    
    processed_list = []

    if isinstance(unprocessed_list, list) == False:
        return processed_list
    
    for item in unprocessed_list:
        if isinstance(item, str):
            if item.isnumeric() == False:
                processed_list.append(item)
    
    processed_list.sort()
    return processed_list
```

Now when you run the code in your challenge.py file, you should get the wanted output.

This code is merely *one possible solution* because we didn't specify details about the implementation of the functions in the `processor` module. As long as the `process_numbers()` and `process_names()` functions fulfilled the requirements in the previous unit, you were successful. Congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
