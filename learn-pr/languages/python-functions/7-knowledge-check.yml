    - content: "When you need to help break down a larger problem into smaller, more manageable pieces."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is an incorrect statement because this is actually a great reason to use functions."
    - content: "When you need to share functionality across one or more programs by adding it to a module."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is an incorrect statement because this is actually a great reason to use functions."
    - content: "When you need to store information that will be used throughout your program."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct answer because it is not a good reason to create a function."
  - content: "How can you make an input argument optional?"
    choices:
    - content: "By adding the `required` keyword."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no `required` keyword."
    - content: "By supplying a default value that should be used if the caller doesn't pass an argument."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "By using keyword arguments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it is possible to use keyword arguments in this capacity, it is not the right technique to make an argument optional."
    - content: "By checking the value to see if it equals `None`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct, because your program will throw an error before you get to any line of code in your function that checks an input parameter for the value `None`."
