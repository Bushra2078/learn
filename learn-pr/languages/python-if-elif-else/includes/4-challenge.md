Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

### Step 1: Add a new file.

Create a new code file for this challenge.  For example, you might create a file named `challenge.py`.

### Step 2: Write code in the new file to solve the challenge.

Write a short program that merely prints one of several messages to the end user based on their input.

First, prompt the user whether they would like to continue or not.

If the user responds with either `no` or `n`, then print the phrase `Exiting`.

You should match the following output in this `no` scenario (with the user entering `no` when prompted):

```output
Would you like to continue? no
Exiting
```

If the user responds with either `yes` or `y`, then print the phrases `Continuing ...` and `Complete!`.

You should match the following output in this `yes` scenario (with the user entering `yes` when prompted):

```output
Would you like to continue? yes
Continuing ...
Complete!
```

If the user responds with anything else, then print the phrase `Please try again and respond with yes or no.`

You should match the following output in this last scenario (with the user entering `bob` when prompted):

```output
Would you like to continue? bob 
Please try again and respond with yes or no.
```
