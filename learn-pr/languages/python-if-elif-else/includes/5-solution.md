The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```python
value = input('Would you like to continue? ')

if value == 'y' or value == 'yes':
    print('Continuing ...')
    print('Complete!')
elif value == 'n' or value == 'no':
    print('Exiting')
else:
    print('Please try again and respond with yes or no.')
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because we didn't specify that you had to use the logical operators.  You could have solved this using nested if statements instead, or could have checked for the "no" scenario before the "yes" scenario.  You may have selected a different variable name to store the user's input.

As long as you matched the expected output in the challenge then you were successful!

If you were successful, congratulations!  Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
