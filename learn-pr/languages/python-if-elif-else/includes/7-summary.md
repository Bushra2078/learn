Our goal was to use decision logic to branch code execution.  Using the `if ... elif ... else` statements and Boolean expressions containing comparison and logical operators, we were able to build applications that could made decisions based on user input and branch code execution appropriately.

Now we can automate complicated decision logic so it can be applied repeatedly and consistently to our end-user input or data.  Decision logic is a fundamental building block required to build virtually every type of program.

And so youâ€™ve just taken your first steps to building more sophisticated applications that can perform logic to enforce business or game rules.
