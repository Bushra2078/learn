Our goal was to use decision logic to branch code execution. Using the `if ... elif ... else` statements and Boolean expressions that contain comparison and logical operators, we built applications that could make decisions based on user input and branch code execution appropriately.

Now we can automate complicated decision logic so that it can be applied repeatedly and consistently to user input or data. Decision logic is a fundamental building block that's required to build virtually every type of program.

You've taken your first steps toward building more sophisticated applications that can perform logic to enforce business or game rules.
