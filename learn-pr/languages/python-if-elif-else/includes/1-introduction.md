In the previous module, you learned that Python's interpreter executes each line of code in your code file sequentially. After it successfully executes the last line of code, the program terminates.

One of the most powerful features of any programming language is the ability to branch the execution path of the program's code based on some decision. The term *branch* refers to two or more separate paths that the program can take. Instead of a sequential path, you create separate paths that are executed or ignored based on some condition you create. For example, you might want to execute certain code that performs an important task if the user inputs the value `y` or `yes` when prompted. Otherwise, you want the Python interpreter to ignore that code and possibly execute different code.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the `if` statement and also the `elif` and `else` statements to branch the execution path of your Python code. You'll use Boolean expressions to create conditions that allow your code to evaluate the values of variables to see if they match. You'll use different comparison operators to increase the usefulness of your Boolean expressions.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to add decision logic to your Python code so that you can create more interesting and complex applications.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Use the `if ... elif ... else` statements to add decision logic to your Python code.
- Understand the Boolean data type and what it represents in Python.
- Compose Boolean expressions by using a rich set of comparison and logic operators.

## Prerequisites

- You should have your Python development environment already set up and know how to create, edit, and execute Python code stored in a `.py` file.
- You should have exposure to the use of input and output functions like `print()` and `input()`.
- You should know how to create and assign values to variables.
