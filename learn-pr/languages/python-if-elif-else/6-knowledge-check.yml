  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is wrong with the following line of code?  `if x == 3`"
    choices:
    - content: "It uses `==` instead of `=` to check for equality."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The equality operator is two equal sign characters."
    - content: "Missing keyword `then` at end"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no `then` keyword in Python."
    - content: "Missing parentheses around the Boolean expression."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Parentheses are not required when using the Python if statement."
    - content: "Missing `:` at end"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Valid if statements must terminate with a colon character."
  - content: "What is the result of the following Boolean expression when `x = 6`: `x > 3 or x < 5`"
    choices:
    - content: "`True`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Since 6 is greater than 3, that part of the entire Boolean expression is `True`, and therefore the entire Boolean expression is `True` since an `or` was used."
    - content: "`False`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "The syntax is incorrect for a Boolean expression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Boolean expression syntax in this code example is correct."
  - content: "What is the result of the following Boolean expression when `x = 6`: `not x`"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The the Boolean expression does not evaluate to `True`."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Since `bool(6)` evaluates to `True`, adding the `not` operator would evaluate to `False`."
    - content: "The syntax is incorrect for a Boolean expression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Boolean expression syntax in this code example is correct."
