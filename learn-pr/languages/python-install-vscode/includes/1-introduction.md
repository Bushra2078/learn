In this module, you'll build a Python development environment that will allow you to learn and build many types of applications.  You'll learn how to execute Python code in interactive mode, and use Visual Studio Code to create a Python code file, write Python code in the file, then execute that file.

By the end of this module, you'll have installed the tools on your computer to move forward towards your goal of building real applications with Python.
