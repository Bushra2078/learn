Our goal was to create a development environment to begin writing Python code.

We installed Python version 3, Visual Studio Code, and the Python extension for Visual Studio Code. We started interactive mode, wrote Python, and ran code one line at a time. We created a Python script file in Visual Studio Code. We then used the built-in command-line interface to instruct the Python interpreter to compile and run the code.

You've taken your first steps toward learning how to use Python to build programs and write scripts to automate tasks, analyze data, and build entire web-based applications, games, and more.
