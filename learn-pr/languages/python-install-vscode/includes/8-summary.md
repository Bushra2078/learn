Our goal was to create a develop environment to begin writing Python code.

We installed Python version 3, Visual Studio Code, and the Python extension for Visual Studio Code.  We launched Interactive Mode, wrote Python and executed that code one line at a time.  We created a Python script file in Visual Studio Code.  Then we used the built-in command-line interface to instruct the Python interpreter to compile and execute the code.

Youâ€™ve just taken your first steps to learning how to use Python to build programs and write scripts to automate tasks, analyze data and build entire web-based applications, games and more.
