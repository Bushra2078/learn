Azure Private Link provides access to Azure services privately over the Microsoft Azure backbone network instead of publicly over the internet.

Suppose you work at Contoso, Ltd., a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Your company has an Azure virtual network that connects to several Azure PaaS services. Your company also connects to these Azure PaaS services via a peered virtual network and an on-premises network that uses Azure ExpressRoute. Contoso also offers company-created Azure services that Contoso customers connect to from their own Azure virtual networks.

However, Contoso IT staff are concerned that every one of these connections requires the public internet, which is considered a security risk. IT would like these connections to not use a public IP address.

As a lead engineer at Contoso, youâ€™re responsible for evaluating the functionality of Azure Private Link to enable employees and customers to bypass the public internet and privately access services on the Azure platform.  

In this module, you'll learn the fundamentals of Azure Private Link, including what it is, how it works, and when you should use it. By the end of this module, you'll be able to evaluate whether Azure Private Link is a suitable solution for offering Contoso employees and customers private access to Azure services.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Explain how Azure Private Link, Azure Private Endpoint, and Azure Private Link service work together to create private connections to Azure resources.
- Evaluate whether Azure Private Link is appropriate for giving your employees, vendors, and customers private access to your Azure services.
- Identify and describe use cases for Azure Private Link.

## Prerequisites

To get the best learning experience from this module, you should have:

- Beginner-level knowledge of Azure, including regions, Azure virtual networks, and ExpressRoute.
- Beginner-level knowledge of networking, including IP addresses and virtual private networks.
- Beginner-level knowledge of cloud computing, including platform as a service (PaaS).
