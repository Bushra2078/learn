You know what Private Link is and how it works. Now you need some criteria to help you evaluate whether Private Link is a suitable choice for your company. To help you make a decision, let's consider the following scenarios:

* Bringing Azure PaaS services into your virtual network
* Securing traffic between your company network and the Azure cloud
* Eliminating internet exposure for PaaS services
* Accessing Azure PaaS resources across networks
* Simplifying network architecture
* Lowering the risk of data exfiltration
* Offering customers private access to company-created Azure services

Do any of these scenarios apply to your company? If so, read the corresponding section below for more details.
