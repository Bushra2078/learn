In this module you learn how Front Door can better serve your web application and provide an overall better experience to your end users. You deploy two websites across a set of web servers and an App Service and used Front Door to route traffic to the best available resource to respond to users. You also enabled Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to prevent malicious access to your web application. 

Now you can take advantage of Front Door's rules engine feature to further process requests at the edge. An example of how rules engine can help is by directly users to the mobile or desktop version of your application based on the client device type. Front Door also has many other features such as URL redirect and URL rewrite to send user to a different page or content that you configure. With customizable rules and security features you can build a modern internet-first architecture for your web applications.
