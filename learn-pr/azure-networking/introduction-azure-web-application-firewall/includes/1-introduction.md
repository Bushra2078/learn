Azure Web Application Firewall is an Azure service that provides centralized protection of web applications from common attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

Suppose you work for Contoso, Ltd., a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Contoso's compute environment runs as Azure virtual network resources. These resources include several existing and planned web applications that serve customers, vendors, and employees.

Contoso IT staff are concerned about their web applications being the target of malicious attacks that use common exploits, such as SQL injection. IT wants to protect their apps, but their in-house web development team lacks the expertise, time, and budget to write the necessary protection code.

Suppose you're a Contoso web development program manager. You're responsible for researching and recommending a web application security solution. In particular, you've been asked to evaluate Azure Web Application Firewall as a method of protecting your company's web apps from attacks that exploit common vulnerabilities.
<!-Consider replacing "web development program manager" with something more common that learners can easily identiy with such as "web developer". -->
In this module, you'll learn the basics of Azure Web Application Firewall. Those basics consist of what it is, how it works, and when you should use it. By the end of this module, youâ€™ll be able to evaluate whether Azure Web Application Firewall is a suitable solution for protecting Contoso's web applications from common vulnerabilities.
