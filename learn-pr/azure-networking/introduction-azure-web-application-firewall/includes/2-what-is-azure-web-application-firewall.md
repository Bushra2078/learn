Here, you learn the basic of Azure Web Application Firewall. This overview will help you evaluate whether Azure Web Application Firewall is a useful tool to add to Contoso's overall network security strategy.

## Overview of Azure Web Application Firewall

Security researchers have shown that new web apps are probed for weaknesses by bots or malicious users within minutes of being deployed. If you put an app on the web, it's prudent to assume that threat actors will test the app for vulnerabilities almost immediately. You can also assume that such probes will continue for the lifetime of the app.

Most malicious tests of web apps look for the presence of one or more common vulnerabilities, such as the following exploits:

- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting
- HTTP request smuggling
- Remote file inclusion

You learn about these and other common attacks a bit later.

A common task in the web app development cycle involves writing code to close the most common security holes. Writing that security code requires time, expertise, and lots of testing.

Azure Web Application Firewall is an Azure service that provides centralized protection of Azure-hosted web apps. Azure Web Application Firewall is designed to protect web apps from common threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

You can deploy Azure Web Application Firewall in minutes. Your web apps are immediately protected from known threats, all without writing a single line of security code.
