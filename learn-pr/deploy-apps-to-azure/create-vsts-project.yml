    You can deploy apps to Azure straight from within Visual Studio. For production use, you can use continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) with Visual Studio Team Services. This CI/CD approach automatically deploys your app to Azure each time you make a code commit to source control.

    Visual Studio Team Services allows for easy collaboration and development without maintaining an on-premises code management solution. Team Services provides cloud code testing, build, and application insights. You can choose a version control repo and IDE that best fits your code development.
