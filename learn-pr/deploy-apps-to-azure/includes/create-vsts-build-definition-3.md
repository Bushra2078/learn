To automatically build and deploy your application, first you have to push your code to Team Services:

1. In Visual Studio Team Explorer, select **Changes**:

    ![Commit local changes to the Team Services Git repo](../media/commit-changes.png)

2. In the commit text box, enter a comment like *Initial commit*. In the drop-down menu, select **Commit All and Sync**.

Wasn't that easy? Next, create and run a Team Services build. Select **Next**.
