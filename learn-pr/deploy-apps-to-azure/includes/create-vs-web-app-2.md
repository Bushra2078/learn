The Web Apps feature of Microsoft Azure App Service (Web Apps) is a service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, whether it's .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on Windows-based or Linux-based environments.

Key features of Web Apps include:

- **Multiple languages and frameworks**: Web Apps has first-class support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and Python.
- **DevOps optimization**: Set up CI/CD with Team Services, GitHub, Bitbucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry. Promote updates through test and staging environments.
- **Global scale with high availability**: Scale up or scale out manually or automatically. Host your apps anywhere in the Microsoft global datacenter infrastructure. The App Service SLA provides for high availability.
- **Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data**: Choose from more than 50 connectors for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). Access on-premises data by using hybrid connections and Azure Virtual Network.
- **Security and compliance**: App Service is compliant with ISO, SOC, and PCI standards. Authenticate users with Azure Active Directory or with a social login (Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Microsoft). Create IP address restrictions and managed service identities.
- **Application templates**: Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
- **Visual Studio integration**: Dedicated tools in Visual Studio streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.
- **API and mobile features**: Web Apps provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios. Web Apps simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.
