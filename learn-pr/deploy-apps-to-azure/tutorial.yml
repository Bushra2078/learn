    You can deploy apps to Azure straight from within Visual Studio. For production use, you can use continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) with Visual Studio Team Services. This CI/CD approach automatically deploys your app to Azure each time you make a code commit to source control.
    
    In this learning scenario, you learn how to deploy a basic ASP.NET app to Azure Web Apps through a VSTS CI/CD pipeline. You learn how to use a deployment slot for review of your application before it goes live in production.

    Visual Studio Team Services allows for easy collaboration and development without maintaining an on-premises code management solution. Team Services provides cloud code testing, build, and application insights. You can choose a version control repo and IDE that best fits your code development.
    
    For this learning scenario, you can use a free account to create a basic ASP.NET web app and CI/CD pipeline. If you do not already have a Team Services account, [create one](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137).

    In the previous lab, you created a project in Team Services. The final step opened your new project in Visual Studio. Let's build and deploy an ASP.NET application from Visual Studio to an Azure Web App.

    Manually deploying an app from Visual Studio isn't great for production scenarios. You shouldn't manually deploy application updates. Instead, you should use a source control and CI/CD solution such as VSTS.

    With your Web App running in Azure and connected with VSTS, now try the whole CI/CD pipeline. After you make a change in Visual Studio and commit your code, a build is triggered which then triggers a release via FTP upload to Azure.

    Deploying your app straight to production may cause problems, so you typically deploy to a staging site. This staging site lets you review your changes before pushing to production.
