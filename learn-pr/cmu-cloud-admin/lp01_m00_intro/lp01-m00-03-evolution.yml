  questions:

  - content: "When did the general ideas about cloud computing and utility computing emerge?"
    choices:
    - content: "Between 1950 and 1966"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The idea of utility computing emerged in the 1950s and 1960s when mainframes were prevalent and expensive, and computer engineers were figuring out ways to share a mainframe among multiple users (such as time sharing). The idea of utility computing is mainly attributed to Professor John McCarthy in the 1960s."
    - content: "Between 1995 and 2000"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not quite right. The ideas behind utility computing have been around since much earlier than that."
    - content: "Between 2006 and the present"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not quite right. The ideas behind utility computing have been around since much earlier than that."

  - content: "Which technology enables multiple servers to be consolidated into the same physical server?"
    choices:
    - content: "Internet Technologies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not quite right. The Internet does enable fast, efficient communication between connected devices, but it's not the primary technology that enables servers to be consolidated."
    - content: "Virtualization"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Virtualization is the primary enabler for server consolidation."
    - content: "Grid Computing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not quite right. Grid computing consolidates a large number of computers as a distributed system to allow the execution of large compute problems."

  - content: "What are the three enabling technologies of cloud computing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Networking, web 2.0, and virtualization"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Networking, web 2.0, and virtualization are all enabling technologies for cloud computing."
    - content: "The internet, large disk sizes, and Java"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The internet is crucial for cloud computing, but bigger disk sizes and Java weren't the crucial developments."

  - content: "Advances in which area led to faster communication, enabling the cloud computing model of leasing compute resources from a remote data center over the internet?"
    choices:
    - content: "Utility computing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The contribution of utility computing is not faster communication."
    - content: "Networking"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Advances in networking led to faster communication, which made distributed applications practical and an important part of cloud computing today."
    - content: "Programming models"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The contribution of utility computing is not faster communication."
    - content: "Virtualization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The contribution of virtualization is not faster communication."
    - content: "Distributed/parallel computing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The contribution of distributed/parallel computing is not faster communication."
