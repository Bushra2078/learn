  questions:

    - content: "A count of requests per minute reaching a server is an example of which of the following?"
      choices:
      - content: "A performance metric"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Requests-per-minute is a metric, not an indicator or a correlation."
      - content: "A performance indicator"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Requests-per-minute is a metric, not an indicator or a correlation."
      - content: "A correlation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Requests-per-minute is a metric, not an indicator or a correlation."
      - content: "None of the above"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Requests-per-minute is a metric, not an indicator or a correlation."

    - content: "In order to monitor the performance of an application deployed to the cloud and determine if and when it needs to be scaled to meet demand, you have configured a dashboard to show the number of requests received per minute and the number of requests processed per minute. The idea is that if the count of requests processed plateaus while the count of requests received continues to grow, the server might be saturated and you need more servers. In this scenario, you are employing which of the following?"
      choices:
      - content: "A performance metric"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This is an example of a USE correlation, which considers the number of requests processed during a given interval, as well as the number of requests that could not be processed."
      - content: "A performance indicator"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This is an example of a USE correlation, which considers the number of requests processed during a given interval, as well as the number of requests that could not be processed."
      - content: "A USE correlation"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! USE considers the number of requests processed during a given interval, as well as the number of requests that could not be processed."
      - content: "A RED correlation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This is an example of a USE correlation, which considers the number of requests processed during a given interval, as well as the number of requests that could not be processed."
