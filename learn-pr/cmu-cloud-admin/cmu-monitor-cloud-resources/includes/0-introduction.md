Cloud computing has resulted in software solutions that are more reliable and more available than ever before. But reliability and availability don't happen by accident. They are the product of careful design, and they must be ensured by constant monitoring that alerts administrators when problems occur (or preferably *before* they occur). Monitoring is as important in mission-critical solutions deployed to the cloud as the solutions themselves. Without it, you don't know whether a solution is serving its users' needs.

Monitoring takes on many forms. It can be as simple as a software component that periodically pings a running application to make sure it's still running. It can also be more complex, keeping running track of key metrics such as request wait times (the length of time a request waits in a queue before it is processed by the system) and CPU utilization. Monitoring can trigger actions such as increasing the number of virtual machines to handle increased workloads or notifying an administrator of a condition that warrants attention. Because it's not reasonable to expect human operators to monitor systems 24x7, monitoring is automated through software. That software can come from third parties, or it can come from the cloud platform itself.

This module deals with the subject of monitoring the behavior of IT systems, which concerns both the infrastructure of these systems and the applications they host. We begin by making the case for automated monitoring, and then examine some of the more common application performance monitoring (APM) platforms. Next, we address the topic of metrics, which are the key measurements a monitoring platform should track, and discuss how these metrics are put to work ensuring system integrity and improving efficiency and robustness. Finally, we tackle the concept of remediation planning, which defines how performance issues are resolved and mitigated.
