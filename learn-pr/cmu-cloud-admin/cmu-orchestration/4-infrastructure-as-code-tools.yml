  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    
    - content: "You are creating an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that defines a cloud solution comprising virtual machines, storage accounts, message queues, and other resources. The template is written in JSON. At run-time, you want to require users to select the Azure region region to which these resources are deployed. What is the proper way to accomplish that with an ARM template?"
      choices:
      - content: "Define the region as an input parameter in the template's "parameters" section."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! The "parameters" section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "Define the region as an input parameter in the template's "resources" section."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The "parameters" section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "Write a custom script that prompts the user to select a region and invoke the script from the template."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The "parameters" section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "None of the above. ARM templates do not support user-defined parameters."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The "parameters" section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."

    - content: "Which of the following statements regarding ARM templates is false?"
      choices: 
        - content: "ARM templates may be written in JSON, but not XML."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. ARM templates are written in JavaScript Object Notation, otherwise known as JSON."
        - content: "Resource names and other attributes specified in an ARM template can reference variables and parameters defined elsewhere in the template."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. ARM templates support certain aspects of a programming language, including the ability to use variables and parameters."
        - content: "ARM templates can be used to deploy resources to Azure and AWS."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! ARM templates can only be used to deploy and update Azure resources."
        - content: "ARM templates can be executed with CLI or PowerShell commands, by applications written in Java, and from the Azure Portal."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. ARM templates can be executed using any of these means."
