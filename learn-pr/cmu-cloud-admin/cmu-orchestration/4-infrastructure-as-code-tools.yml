  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    
    - content: "You are creating an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that defines a cloud solution comprising virtual machines, storage accounts, message queues, and other resources. The template is written in JSON. At run-time, you want to require users to select the Azure region region to which these resources are deployed. What is the proper way to accomplish that with an ARM template?"
      choices:
      - content: "Define the region as an input parameter in the template's "parameters" section."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! The "parameters" section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "Define the region as an input parameter in the template's "resources" section."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The "parameters" section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "Write a custom script that prompts the user to select a region and invoke the script from the template."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The "parameters" section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "None of the above. ARM templates do not support user-defined parameters."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The "parameters" section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
