This module presented some of the challenges to securing assets in the cloud and the technologies and methodologies that help organizations meet these challenges head on. Here's a recap of some of the key points:

- Information isn't secure by default; administrators must take proactive steps to make it secure.

- Responsibility for the security of information stored in the cloud is shared by cloud service providers and cloud customers. CSPs are responsible for the security *of* the cloud, while customers are responsible for security *in* the cloud. It is up to customers, for example, to make sure that applications they deploy to the cloud are secure.

- The Shared Responsibility Model (SRM) adopted by Microsoft, Amazon, and Google defines who is responsible for what.

- Cloud assets are constantly under attack. The Cloud Security Alliance documents the greatest threats to cloud security in order to help organizations defend against them.

- Encryption plays an important role in securing data, both at rest and in motion.

- Symmetric encryption is typically used to encrypt data at rest. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a popular symmetric encryption algorithm.

- Asymmetric encryption, also known as *public key cryptography*, is frequently used to encrypt data in motion. Transport Layer Security (TLS), which encrypts traffic that travels over the wire between parties (for example, between Web browsers and Web servers), uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

- The greatest challenge to encrypting data is not the encryption itself, but how to store keys securely and securely exchange them between interested parties.

- Services such as Azure Key Vault and AWS Key Management Service provide secure storage for encryption keys.

- Server certificates allow servers to provide public keys to clients and enable clients to verify the authenticity of the servers.

- The best approach to data security is a multilayered one that comprises multiple defenses at multiple levels. If an attacker breaches one defense, the next one may stop them.

- Data security platforms (DSPs) can help administrators implement security protocols. Today's public cloud platforms have integrated support for many DSP features, including logging data accesses and data discovery and classification.

- Government regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR impose additional requirements on an organization's handling of data. Organizations must be aware of the regulations that affect them and take steps to ensure compliance. Penalties for non-compliance can be severe.

Security in cloud systems requires diligent planning and understanding. Security is a process, and one for which cloud administrators and cloud security professionals must be ever mindful.
