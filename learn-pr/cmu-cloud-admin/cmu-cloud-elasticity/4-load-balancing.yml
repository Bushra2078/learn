  questions:

    - content: "Consider the following scenario: you are using a load balancer with a round-robin scheduler as a front-end to two web servers. One web server is a medium instance that contains 2 cores and 8 GB RAM, while the other is a large instance containing 4 cores and 16 GB RAM. Which of the following scenarios is likely?

        I. Both instances will receive an equal number of requests.
        II. Both instances will be equally utilized in terms of percentage of CPU and memory.
        III. The large instance will receive twice as many requests as the medium instance.
        IV. The medium instance will receive twice as many requests as the large instance.
        V. The large instance will have twice the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) of the medium Instance.
        VI. The large instance will have half the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) of the medium instance."
      
      choices:
      - content: "I and VI"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
      - content: "III and V"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Round-robin distribution effectively alternates in sending requests to each instance. It does not take into account the resource utilization of individual instances."
