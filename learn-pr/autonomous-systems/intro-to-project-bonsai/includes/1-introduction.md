Microsoft Project Bonsai is a low-code AI platform used to accelerate development for control systems that provide operator guidance or make independent decisions. 

Build AI-powered control systems to:

- Optimize process variables.
- Improve production efficiency.
- Help reduce downtime.

To help you understand how Bonsai works, we'll describe the underlying logical elements. The following image displays those elements, which include:

- Training simulator.
- Training engine.
- Training curriculum.
- Integrated simulator.
- Trained AI or a *Bonsai brain*.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a soap manufacturing company. The company uses an extrusion process to produce its soap. It also uses an advanced process-control system to manage production.

The engineers who manage the advanced process-control system believe changing the manufacturing process could improve production yield. To make the changes, the engineers send new commands to the advanced process-control system to control manufacturing. The advanced process-control system then adjusts the manufacturing equipment accordingly.

The soap manufacturing process is complex. It can be difficult to control and therefore optimize production. Some of the variables include:

- Adjustments to parts of the manufacturing equipment.
- Variations in raw materials.
- Wear and tear on machinery.
- Residue from previous production runs.

The soap company can benefit from utilizing a Bonsai brain, which could:

- Automatically signal the advanced process-control system.
- Adapt quickly to production changeovers.
- Apply short-term process changes from extruder residue.
- Apply long-term process changes because of equipment wear and tear.
- Advise operators to make adjustments instead of controlling the extruder directly.

## What will we be doing?

You'll assess the capabilities of Project Bonsai to develop and deploy AI-powered control systems. To do this, you'll:

- Identify the key features and components of Bonsai.
- Describe the function of these components.
- Determine whether Bonsai is a good fit for your organization.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to determine whether Bonsai is suitable for your organization. You'll also be able to describe how Bonsai can help accelerate AI-powered automation development.
