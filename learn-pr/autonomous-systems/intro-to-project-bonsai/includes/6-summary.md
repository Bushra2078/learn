Our goal was to help you to determine:

- Whether Project Bonsai is suitable for your organization.
- How Bonsai can help accelerate AI-powered automation development.

To help with your decision, you discovered answers to the following questions:

- Is there value in optimizing any of your automation systems?
- Do you have AI experts in your organization to optimize those systems?
- Can you use an existing simulation of your automation systems or build a new one?

You applied these criteria to a fictional soap manufacturing company. You should now be able to determine whether Project Bonsai can help accelerate AI-powered automation development.
