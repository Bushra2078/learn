quiz:
  questions:

  - content: "Which component in Bonsai is responsible for generating learning models based on a training curriculum?"
    choices:
    - content: "The simulation engine"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The simulation engine lets your Bonsai brain interact with a realistic training environments based on your simulated system."
    - content: "The training curriculum"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The training curriculum defines the goals and objectives your Bonsai brain will learn."
    - content: "The training engine"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The architect component of the training engine generates learning models."
  - content: "In which of the following scenarios could Bonsai be of some benefit to an organization?"
    choices:
    - content: "An organization has concluded that there's considerable scope for improving automated production systems."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This scenario is ideal for Bonsai."
    - content: "An organization uses little in the way of automation systems."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Bonsai is designed to help optimize automation systems."
    - content: "An organization has no simulations, and no experts skilled in working with simulations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Bonsai works with simulations to optimize an automation system."
  - content: "When designing your simulation model for a Bonsai brain, what's the purpose of having a customizable start state?"
    choices:
    - content: "It helps ensure meaningful real-time assessment during training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Real-time assessment during training is provided by having useful visualization and data output in your simulation."
    - content: "It helps ensure that the Bonsai brain learns from various conditions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A customizable start state means you can adjust the start conditions to test the brain's responses to new scenarios."
    - content: "It helps identify when a system gets into a state where further progress is impossible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It is important that your simulation be able to determining system failure, but that behavior is independent from the start state."
  - content: "Which of the following statements about working with the training engine in Bonsai is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Instructor carries out the underlying AI algorithms selected by the Architect."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Learner performs this task."
    - content: "The Predictor carries out the training plan by configuring the Learner."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Instructor performs this task."
    - content: "The Architect creates and optimizes learning topologies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Architect also proposes the configuration of learning algorithms and topologies."
  - content: "Which statement about Bonsai brains is accurate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your Bonsai brain can contain only one version."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your Bonsai brain can contain multiple versions."
    - content: "Bonsai brains learn a given curriculum through iterative training with the training engine."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Also, when you make significant changes to your curriculum, Bonsai creates a new brain version automatically."
    - content: "When you're happy with your Bonsai brain, you can export only the latest version."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can export any version of the brain."
