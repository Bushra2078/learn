You've successfully created a console app that sends SMS messages using Azure Communication Services!

In this module you learned:

* What Azure Communication Services is and how to create an Azure Communication Services resource.
* How to provision an SMS-enabled phone number using the Azure Portal.
* How to send an SMS message using this phone number from a C# console app.

## Clean up

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

If you have any phone numbers assigned to your resource upon resource deletion, the phone numbers will be released from your resource automatically at the same time.
